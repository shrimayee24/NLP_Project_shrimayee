Gabriella Zuniga’s explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000—despite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, Gabriella Zuniga’s decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she’s continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee—known for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean “Diddy” Combs—Zuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit “an extortion attempt.” In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe’s child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe. Once on the brink of signing a $100 million media deal, the NFL Hall of Famer has since stepped away from First Take and postponed his Nightcap podcast tour with co-host Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.“We’ve decided to postpone the Nightcap tour,” Sharpe stated. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the summer of 2026. It’s going to be even bigger, even better.”Also Read: “Sh*t on their shoes”: Erin Andrews disgusted and blasts ‘trashy’ women for public restroom selfies Despite planning a return to ESPN for the 2025-26 season, Sharpe’s future now hinges on the outcome of this high-stakes legal battle.","Gabriella Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000.

Sam Altman just dropped a big AI prediction for 2026; experts are skeptical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-just-dropped-a-big-ai-prediction-for-2026-experts-are-skeptical/articleshow/121811592.cms,"Sam Altman AI prediction for 2026

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful.""Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that by 2026, AI systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" ""Novel insight"" is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses.

Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-was-brilliant-but-dont-copy-this-one-habit-of-him-warns-pixars-pete-docter/articleshow/121851338.cms,"Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, “This Is Not My Business” - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that’s ‘one habit’ you shouldn’t copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs’ decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs’ legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn’t just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. “He would call — especially the producers — at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Docter revealed. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”This intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. “That’s what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,” he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. “Who wouldn’t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?” Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter’s reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn’t about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn’t just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.",Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million.

What does new tatkal ticket booking rules mean for regular travelers

In a significant overhaul of Indian railways' ticketing policy, the Ministry of Railways made it clear that from July 1, 2025, only Aadhaar-verified users will be entitled to reserve tickets under the Tatkal system through the IRCTC portal or mobile application. It is a key step towards stricter digital identity authentication to prevent misuse, bring in more transparency, and ensure the facility of emergency ticketing reaches legitimate passengers.In a sequel to this order, the ministry has also directed an extra OTP-based Aadhaar authentication layer from July 15, 2025, in order to further rationalise the process. The Indian Railways' move, as conveyed to all zonal railway divisions on June 10, 2025, is in light of increasing festival season demand and growing complaints of manipulation of bookings by agents. Here is the entire explanation of the new regulations, implementation schedule, agent restrictions, and booking practical tips all passengers must be aware of.From July 1, Tatkal tickets could only be booked by passengers who have done Aadhaar authentication on IRCTC's website and mobile app.From July 15, 2025, even authenticated users will have to undergo a one-time password (OTP) authentication process associated with their Aadhaar number during every Tatkal booking.With a view to minimizing bulk bookings and ensuring level playing ground for the public:These restrictions will be applied on all zones and directions have been issued to both CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems) and IRCTC to enforce these steps by modifying back-end systems and user interfaces.The Railway Ministry has made it clear that the aim is to:The new policy essentially transforms the manner in which emergency train tickets will be secured in India. While Aadhaar verification maximizes transparency and equity, it might also present challenges for those who have not linked their ID with IRCTC or those who are not technologically savvy. But in the long term, these shifts are bound to eliminate ticketing frauds, deter illegal agents, and empower legitimate users with quicker, better access.","IRCTC agents will be prohibited from booking Tatkal tickets within the first half-hour of the booking window.

Android 16 IS HERE! Live Notifications, Tablet Desktop Mode & MORE!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines. In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Thursday at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, Huang said “This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.”Nvidia is playing an important role in the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), supplying both hardware and software to support their development. The US chip giant is a key enabler behind the growing fleet of self-driving cars , especially in the U.S., where Waymo — owned by Google — operates robotaxi services in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.China has also seen growing adoption, with companies like Baidu and Pony.ai running their own robotaxi networks.Recently, Huang attended the London Tech Week where he said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. Admitting that computing was hard historically, he said “We had to learn programming languages. We had to architect it. We had to design these computers that are very complicated”. “Now, all of a sudden ... there’s a new programming language. This new programming language is called ‘human,’” he added. ""Most people don't know C++, very few people know Python, and everybody, as you know, knows human.”He continued: “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely.”“And the thing that’s really, really quite amazing is the way you program an AI is like the way you program a person.”Explaining further, Huang gave an example saying, “You say, 'You are an incredible poet. You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines.

Cool captions for WhatsApp status



HOME: Where I can look ugly and enjoy it.

Today morning when I was driving my Ferrari, the alarm woke me up.

Dear Math, please grow up and solve your problems. I'm tired of answering them for you.

Normal is boring.

I need Google in my brain.

I like to hang out with people that make me forget to look at my phone.

I've found the recipe for happiness. Can someone just send me some money so that I can buy the ingredients?

I love food and sleep. If I give you a bit of food or text you all night, that means something.

Be your own kind of beautiful

Unlike protons I don’t deal with negativity

ME my room music internet connection no study a perfect day

If u can’t do great things then do small and simple things in a great way

Real beauty is to be true to oneself that’s what makes me feel good

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don’t have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Keep calm and let karma finish it

I’m not a player I’m the game

Don’t tell people your dreams show them

Success is the best revenge for anything

I’m not special I’m just a limited edition

Be so good they can’t ignore you

I may be wrong but I doubt it

Turn your wounds into wisdom

Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive

Be a voice not an echo

Keep your heels head and standards high

My life my rules my attitude

Make today so awesome that yesterday gets jealous

Life is short make every hair flip fabulous

Be your own kind of beautiful

The best things in life are free The second best are very expensive

Confidence is not they will like me Confidence is I’ll be fine if they don’t

Collect moments not things

You are enough just as you are

Find yourself and be that

Don’t be a prisoner of your past Become the architect of your future

Choose people who choose you

Be fearless in pursuing what sets your soul on fire

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside

Don’t stop until you’re proud

I am not a product of my circumstances I am a product of my decisions

Stay real stay loyal or stay away from me

Life is too short to be serious all the time So if you cant laugh at yourself call me Ill laugh at you

Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don't have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Motivational WhatsApp captions



What you lack in talent can be made up with desire, hustle, and giving 110% all the time.

Do what you can with all you have, wherever you are.

Develop an attitude of gratitude. Say thank you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you.

You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new one.

To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage.

Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.

Fake it until you make it. Act as if you had all the required confidence until it becomes your reality.

The future belongs to the competent. Get good, get better, be the best.

For every reason it’s not possible, there are hundreds of people who have faced the same circumstances and succeeded.

Be a fountain, not a drain.

Great things never come from comfort zones.

Life is a journey, not a destination.

Life always offers you a second chance. It’s called tomorrow.

Every new day is another chance to change your life.

Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.

Prove yourself to yourself, not to others.

Work for a cause, not applause. Live life to express, not to impress.

When you can’t change the direction of the wind, adjust your sails.

Why fit in if you’re born to stand out?

Don’t take kindness as a sign of weakness.

Minds are like parachutes — they only function when open.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.

Hustle in silence, let your results make the noise.

Every day is a fresh start – make it count.

Dream big. Work hard. Stay focused.

Rise above the storm and you’ll find the sunshine.

The grind never lies.

Your only limit is your mindset.

Make it happen. Shock everyone.

Progress over perfection, always.

Don’t wait for an opportunity. Create it.

Fuel your hustle with passion.

You weren’t born to be average.

Prove them wrong – every single day.

Stay hungry, stay humble.

Keep going – your future self will thank you.

Build a life you don’t need a vacation from.

The best views come after the hardest climbs.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

This year is yours – take the shot.

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I’m drowning in memories and there’s no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It’s hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren’t as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it’s not

I’m not okay but I’ll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It’s hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I’m left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I’m tired of fighting for a love that’s already gone

The scars you can’t see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine

Lost in a world that doesn’t see me

It hurts, but I’ll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect… until we weren’t

Crying isn’t a weakness, it’s a release

The hardest part is acting like it’s okay

Some scars never show, but they’re the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn’t say goodbye

I’m okay… just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Mark Cuban faces users backlash, asked to ...

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky , the decentralized social media platform he once championed, for becoming “ruder and more hateful,” according to a report by the New York Post. Cuban, known for his tech ventures and former ownership of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, warned that the platform’s lack of diverse perspectives is driving users back to Elon Musk ’s X, formerly Twitter.Cuban, who joined Bluesky in late 2024 with an optimistic post -— “Hello Less Hateful World” -- now says the platform has devolved into a hostile echo chamber. “The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,” he wrote in a series of posts this week, as quoted by the Post. He noted that the platform’s predominantly left-leaning user base often meets dissenting or nuanced opinions with outrage, stifling meaningful discussion. “Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban added.The Post reports that Cuban, who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election but did not donate to her campaign, shared a Washington Post opinion piece by Megan McArdle, which argued that Bluesky’s left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban endorsed the piece, urging users to use the platform’s moderation tools to block rather than attack those they disagree with. “The moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don’t want to see on here, just block them. Don’t attack them,” he wrote.However, Cuban’s critiques sparked backlash from some Bluesky users , the Post noted. Responses included profane attacks, with one user writing, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t,” and another stating, “F–kin leave then, p—y.” A third user, whose post Cuban reposted, called him a “despicable bastard” and told him to “just Go Away.”The report highlighted Bluesky’s rapid growth, noting that its user base tripled from 10 million to over 30 million between November 2024 and May 2025, according to Pew Research Center. This surge followed Elon Musk’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which prompted many liberal-leaning users to leave X for Bluesky. Yet, Cuban’s recent comments suggest the platform’s ideological slant may now be pushing users back to Twitter.Cuban, whose net worth is approximately $8.35 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, lamented that even minor disagreements on Bluesky often escalate into hostility. “Even if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a grey area, they will call you a fascist etc.,” he wrote, per the Post.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky, the decentralized social media platform he once championed.

Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo signed a bill into law allowing Nevada residents to hang religios door disp;ayes inlcuding Hindu torans and Jewish mezuzah.

The bill was introduced by Senators Julie Pazina, Dina Neal, Edgar Flores, Melanie Scheible, and Lisa Krasner, and Assemblymembers Erica P. Roth and Duy Nguyen.The bill permits religious displays upon dwellings that are no larger than 12” x 36”. The bill also requires maintenance workers to store religious displays in a way that preserves its sanctity.“This bill is a significant win for Nevada Hindus because it ensures residents’ right not only to observe their Hindu faith unencumbered, but also to bless their homes and everyone who enters them with the display of a toran, as their faith calls them to,"" HAF managing director Samir Kalra said.The law will come into force on October 1, 2025.The bill overrides any homeowner association (HOA) or residential restrictions that might prohibit such displays, thereby safeguarding the religious practices of Nevada residents.The Hindu toran, a traditional decorative item often hung above doorways, holds cultural and religious significance in Hindu households.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Elon Musk's Neuralink may be using monkeys to give humans ‘superpowers’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-neuralink-may-be-using-monkeys-to-give-humans-superpowers/articleshow/121838358.cms,"How Neuralink’s Blindsight device can help its users



Elon Musk-owned Neuralink is reportedly testing brain implants in monkeys that can eventually give humans ""superpowers,"" including capabilities beyond normal vision. While the device’s initial goal may be to restore vision in visually impaired patients, the company's long-term objective for its Blindsight device includes enabling "" superhuman capabilities "" such as infrared sight, the tech billionaire predicted in March. Now, a company engineer has revealed that its tests using brain implants in monkeys has enable one of primate to see something which is not physically present. At a recent conference, Neuralink engineer Joseph O’Doherty announced that the device, Blindsight, stimulated vision-linked brain areas in a monkey. During tests, the monkey moved its eyes toward what researchers wanted to make the monkey’s brain to visualise at least two-thirds of the time.According to a report by Bloomberg, these findings are Neuralink’s first public disclosures regarding test progress with Blindsight. Earlier this year, Musk confirmed that Blindsight has been tested in monkeys for several years, with human trials planned for later this year.This area of research represents a closely observed frontier in brain device development, exploring how technology may treat challenging medical conditions. However, it's important to note that the device is not yet approved for human use in the US, and it remains to be determined how the findings from animal studies would translate to humans.Neuralink executive O’Doherty added that the company eventually intends to pair the implanted chip with specialised glasses to help display the enhanced visual data. Testing in monkeys offers practical advantages, since a monkey’s visual cortex lies nearer the brain’s surface. For human applications, Neuralink plans to use its surgical robot to insert the implant into deeper cortical regions.Musk sees these medical achievements as steps toward speeding up human communication and “mitigating the risk of digital super-intelligence,” a vision he outlined in 2024. Apart from this device, his work on brain–machine interfaces is also running alongside AI development at xAI Corp.","Elon Musk-owned Neuralink is reportedly testing brain implants in monkeys that can eventually give humans ""superpowers,"" including capabilities beyond normal vision.
