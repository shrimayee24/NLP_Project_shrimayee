I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Lucy Guo dropped out of college

How Lucy Guo learnt to earn money as a kid

Lucy Guo , world's youngest self-made billionaire and serial entrepreneur, credits her frugal parents with motivating her to start hustling at a young age. Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Her first company, Scale AI, an AI data-labeling firm, was acquired by tech giant Meta for a whopping $25 billion.Today, Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022. She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019 to invest in early-stage tech startups. Growing up in Fremont, California, with Chinese immigrant parents, Guo was taught the importance of both education and money. ""They threw me into Abacus competitions,"" she told CNBC Make It, adding that she was ""definitely forced to have good academics.""Her focus on academics led her to study computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. However, she dropped out after two years, with only a year left to complete her Computer Science degree. This decision was a major disappointment for her parents.""They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,"" Guo explained. ""For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.""Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship , a program that provides young people with $200,000 to build innovative companies. ""I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them,"" she said, ""when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.""Lucy Guo’s parents lived ""a very frugal life,"" but always emphasized the importance of having money. As a result, she started hustling in elementary school. ""I would find ways to make money on the playground,"" she said. This included trading and selling Pokémon cards, colored pencils, and ""anything I could find.""Her parents were strict, and if she misbehaved, they would take her money away. In response, Guo, in second grade, went to Home Depot to get a debit card and opened a PayPal account to store her cash.As the years went on, her money-making endeavors grew. A fan of the game Neopets, she would sell virtual creatures and in-game currency on forums. ""I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,"" she said.After discovering engineering and coding, she began making and selling bots to cheat in games. From there, her ventures ""snowballed."" ""I then started finding other ways to make money on the internet from making websites using Google AdSense, then creating internet marketing tools...it just snowballed from there,"" she is quoted as saying.","Lucy Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Communication features disabled in Saudi Arabia and UAE

“The safety and well-being of children online is a top priority... We will continue to work together to ensure a safe, trusted, and positive digital environment for all UAE users, especially children.”

Regional bans and content moderation efforts

Kuwait’s ban was announced on August 21, 2025, following community complaints.



Qatar restricted access on August 13, although the government has not publicly commented.



Turkey blocked the platform on August 7, with Roblox stating it is cooperating with authorities.



Oman and Jordan imposed earlier restrictions, and the game is currently restricted in various degrees across countries like Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Yemen.





“As part of this vision, and in view of recent discussions with regulatory authorities in a number of countries across the Middle East, we are committing to enhance our Arabic communication and content moderation capabilities.”





Guardian investigation reveals serious safety lapses

Voice and text chat features were accessible even to users listed as under 13, due to easily bypassed age verification mechanisms.



Test avatars registered as children accessed sexually suggestive environments, including virtual hotel rooms, fetish accessories, and public bathrooms that enabled inappropriate roleplay.



Audio from voice chat included explicit sounds like kissing, grunting, and slurping, which the platform’s real-time AI moderation failed to filter.



In one case, an adult avatar was able to solicit Snapchat details from a five-year-old avatar using barely disguised language.





“There are bad actors on the internet... this is an issue that goes beyond Roblox and needs to be addressed through collaboration with governments and an industry-wide commitment to strong safety measures.”

Wider backlash and company response

Launching content tags



Updating parental tools



Increasing in-game moderation staff



Rolling out region-specific language moderation, especially in Arabic-speaking regions





“Our vision is to connect people with optimism and civility... by creating a platform where users of all ages can have a safe, civil and positive experience.”





Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, following mounting regional and global scrutiny over child safety. The move, which affects millions of young users in the Middle East ’s largest gaming markets, comes after discussions with government regulators and follows similar actions in other countries across the region.Roblox, the widely used online gaming and creation platform, has halted all in-experience communication features—including voice and text chat, for users in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The decision was made following talks with regulatory bodies in both nations and is part of a broader push to bolster digital child safety.In Saudi Arabia, the changes were coordinated with the General Authority for Media Regulation, which emphasized its role in protecting the public from the adverse effects of electronic games. According to the regulator, this measure aims to prevent exposure to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and potential online predatory behavior.Meanwhile, in the UAE, the move followed discussions between Roblox and the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). In a joint statement, the TDRA and Roblox said:Both countries have implemented the restrictions effective immediately.Roblox also committed to enhancing its Arabic-language content and introducing stronger moderation tools, including content filters and improved parental controls.The action in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is part of a wider wave of regulatory crackdowns across the Middle East. Several countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Oman, Jordan, and others, have already blocked access to Roblox entirely in response to escalating concerns over child safety.Roblox remains accessible in Saudi Arabia, which is considered one of the largest emerging gaming markets in the region. However, the suspension of chat functions marks a significant shift in how the platform is being regulated there.Roblox has stated:A key driver of these policy shifts was an investigation by The Guardian and UK-based research agency Revealing Reality, which exposed critical failures in Roblox’s safety systems, particularly its chat features. The report documented how children as young as five were able to interact with adults inside the platform’s games, often without any effective moderation.Key findings from the investigation include:The researchers concluded that while Roblox advertises itself as a “child-friendly” platform, its safety features are limited in their effectiveness, and the actual in-game experience often contradicts that appearance.In response, Roblox acknowledged:The company also admitted that age verification for under-13 users continues to be an industry-wide challenge.Beyond the Middle East, Roblox has faced increasing legal and public pressure to improve safety controls. In August 2025, Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, accusing it of facilitating the systemic sexual exploitation and abuse of children in the United States.The company has also drawn backlash for banning content creators like Schlep, a vigilante YouTuber known for acting as a self-proclaimed “predator hunter” within the game. Schlep claims to have contributed to the arrest of six suspected predators before being banned by Roblox for violating community guidelines.Roblox has responded with a series of measures:The company reiterated its long-term goal:Despite these efforts, confidence among parents, regulators, and users remains shaken. The recent steps in the UAE and Saudi Arabia mark a turning point in the platform’s ongoing struggle to reconcile its popularity with its responsibility to protect young users.",Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Dead Sea mystery: Strange 'salt snow' could explain hidden structures below,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/dead-sea-mystery-strange-salt-snow-could-explain-hidden-structures-below/articleshow/123678887.cms,"

What is ‘ salt snow ’ of Dead Sea

How the Dead Sea became a natural laboratory



Salt giants beneath the surface



Climate change and its role



Why it matters globally





In one of the most unusual natural discoveries of recent years, scientists have observed what they call “salt snow” falling beneath the surface of the Dead Sea. Unlike normal snowfall, this strange process happens underwater as halite crystals form and descend like snowflakes. Researchers believe this rare phenomenon may help explain how massive underground salt structures such as chimneys, domes, and kilometer-thick deposits are created. Triggered by climate change, evaporation, and water diversion, the “salt snow” not only reshapes the Dead Sea but also offers clues to Earth’s geological past.Salt snow refers to the precipitation of halite crystals within the Dead Sea. Normally, salt crystallization is seen in shallow or cold water layers, but here it occurs year-round, even during summer. The process begins when surface water becomes warmer and saltier due to evaporation. This dense water cools and sinks, while colder, less salty water from below rises. The mixing of these layers triggers crystal formation in mid-water zones, creating the illusion of snow falling underwater.The Dead Sea is the lowest point on Earth’s surface and one of the saltiest water bodies in the world, making it uniquely suited for such phenomena.Historically, its water remained layered and stable. But since the 1980s, reduced inflow from the Jordan River and intensified evaporation have disrupted this balance. As a result, annual mixing of water layers now fuels continuous salt crystallization. Unlike other seas such as the Red Sea or the Mediterranean, where similar processes ended millions of years ago, the Dead Sea remains active, offering a living glimpse into Earth’s geological history.These falling crystals accumulate over time, forming vast salt structures beneath the seabed. Known as salt giants, chimneys, and domes, they can reach more than a kilometer in thickness and extend over vast distances. Such formations are crucial for geologists because they mirror conditions during the Messinian Salinity Crisis over 5 million years ago, when the Mediterranean dried up and massive salt deposits were left behind. The Dead Sea now serves as a smaller-scale model of that ancient process.The salt snow is not just a scientific curiosity, it reflects wider environmental shifts. Climate change, combined with human-driven freshwater diversion, has caused the Dead Sea’s water level to drop by about one meter per year. This accelerates salinity increases and alters stratification, intensifying salt precipitation. The unusual “snowfall” thus acts as a visible marker of climate stress on fragile ecosystems, highlighting how human activities and warming temperatures reshape natural processes.Understanding the Dead Sea’s salt snow provides more than local insights. These formations record climate fluctuations and hydrological imbalances, offering a geological archive of environmental change. On a broader scale, studying this phenomenon could shed light on how coastal systems respond to rising salinity and climate change worldwide. It also informs research into erosion, resource extraction, and the stability of other saltwater basins. Scientists believe the lessons from the Dead Sea could also apply to other extreme environments, including ancient Martian lakes. The discovery underscores how even the harshest ecosystems can hold keys to unlocking planetary history.","Scientists have observed ‘salt snow’ falling beneath the surface of the Dead Sea.

A stunning video capture

Newlyweds speak out

The police search intensifies

A wedding day to remember—for the wrong reasons





In what can only be described as a jaw-dropping wedding heist, a man infiltrated a Glendale, California wedding, swiped a box containing $60,000 in cash and checks, and made a hasty getaway in a luxury Mercedes SUV. The entire scene, captured on video, has now gone viral, leaving social media users stunned and the Glendale Police scrambling for leads, ABC news reported.The theft occurred on the night of August 31, during the wedding reception of George and Nadeen Farahat at the Renaissance Banquet Hall. What was supposed to be one of the happiest days of their lives quickly turned into a nightmare, when the suspect, who had apparently blended in seamlessly with the wedding guests, made off with the hefty sum.According to the Glendale Police Department, the robbery took place around 12:50 am local time, right after midnight. The suspect, described as a middle-aged man in his 40s of either Middle Eastern or White descent, was seen entering the hall with the ease of someone familiar with the event. Surveillance footage shows him scanning the room as if searching for something, or someone, before targeting the box.That box, which contained a substantial sum in both cash and checks, was a wedding gift pile centerpiece.Witnesses say the suspect, dressed in all black, casually walked up to it, grabbed the box, and made a swift exit toward the venue’s exit door. The chase didn’t end there. Another security camera outside the venue recorded the man jumping into the passenger seat of a sleek black Mercedes SUV, which then sped off into the night.ABC News shared a viral clip from the wedding, where viewers can see the suspect, bald-headed and quick on his feet, bolting out of the hall with the box under his arm. The partygoers, unaware of the crime unfolding before their eyes, continue dancing and mingling as if nothing is amiss. In a shocking twist, it’s revealed that the suspect even had the audacity to grab a drink at the bar before making his exit.The footage has since circulated on social media, where viewers have been left in disbelief at the audacity of the man’s actions. Some have even jokingly dubbed him “The Boldest Wedding Crasher.”In an exclusive interview with ABC News, the bride, Nadeen Farahat, expressed her shock and disbelief. ""It’s terrifying to think that someone would target you during such an intimate moment in your life,"" she said. ""It’s just hard to swallow that someone walked in, dressed in black, like a shadow—and took what was supposed to be our special day’s gifts.""Nadeen revealed that the man didn’t just slip in unnoticed, he mingled with guests, even sipping on a drink at the bar. ""It was scary,"" she admitted. ""It was like he was part of the crowd, and then, just like that, he took everything.""Her husband, George Farahat, tried to maintain a positive outlook despite the circumstances. ""Honestly, the scariest part was that we didn’t know what could have happened. Thank goodness no one was hurt. We’re just trying to focus on the positive, celebrating our marriage, even though this happened.""The Glendale Police Department is actively investigating the incident and has released the footage in hopes of tracking down the thief. In a statement, police urged anyone with information to come forward. While the suspect’s identity remains unknown, they believe he may have some prior knowledge of the venue, given how smoothly he executed the heist.The newlyweds have also offered a reward—$5,000—for information leading to the suspect’s capture. ""We just want justice,"" George Farahat told ABC News. ""Whoever did this needs to face the consequences.""For the Farahats, the incident has cast a shadow over what should have been a joyous day. Still, they remain hopeful that their wedding day memory won’t be forever overshadowed by this crime. ""It’s hard,"" Nadeen said, ""but we’re trying to move forward. It was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives, and it still can be.""As police work around the clock to track down the thief, the Farahats are left hoping that the only thing they remember about their wedding day will be the love they shared, not the audacious heist that disrupted it.","A man infiltrated a Glendale, California wedding, swiped a box containing $60,000 in cash and checks, and made a hasty getaway in a luxury Mercedes SUV.

Stone Age underwater city: A window into prehistoric life

Broader research and scientific significance





Archaeologists have uncovered a remarkably well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast. Dubbed the “Stone Age Atlantis,” the site went underwater as massive ice sheets melted at the end of the last Ice Age, raising sea levels and flooding coastal communities. Preserved in an oxygen-free underwater environment, the settlement has effectively become a “time capsule,” halting decomposition and providing unprecedented insight into early human life. Artefacts, including wooden tools, arrowheads, animal bones, hazelnuts, and seal teeth, reveal a thriving Mesolithic society skilled in fishing, hunting, and crafting tools.The settlement offers a rare glimpse into Mesolithic life. Archaeologists have excavated about 430 square feet at a depth of 26 feet, uncovering evidence of organised human activity. Wooden tools, stone implements, and food remnants, such as hazelnuts, indicate a society that relied on fishing, hunting, and gathering. The site’s preservation provides valuable information on how early humans adapted to environmental changes, particularly rising sea levels that transformed coastlines and habitats.Researchers employed specialised underwater technologies, including vacuum systems, to safely recover artefacts without damaging them. The oxygen-free conditions preserved both organic and inorganic materials, allowing archaeologists to study Mesolithic tools, structures, and dietary remains in remarkable detail. Experts describe the site as a “time capsule,” where everything feels as though time has stopped, offering unique insights into prehistoric human life.This discovery is part of a six-year, €15.5 million European Union-funded project mapping submerged prehistoric landscapes across the North and Baltic Seas. Scientists aim to reconstruct coastal human activity, subsistence strategies, and adaptation to climate change during the post-Ice Age period. The Aarhus site complements other submerged settlements, including locations near Alexandria, Egypt, and lakes in North America, shedding light on how ancient civilisations responded to rising waters and changing environments. Researchers believe such underwater finds may also help refine climate models by providing concrete data on past sea-level rise. The artefacts offer a fascinating glimpse into everyday life in the Stone Age. They also highlight the skill and ingenuity of early humans in using available resources.Stone Age Atlantis demonstrates how early humans thrived despite environmental challenges. Artefacts such as fishing tools, seal remains, and arrowheads highlight their ingenuity, while the preserved settlement layout suggests organised community life. Beyond archaeology, the site offers valuable lessons for modern societies on climate resilience, illustrating how humans have historically adapted to rising sea levels—insights that remain highly relevant today. The Stone Age Atlantis discovery not only enriches our understanding of prehistoric human ingenuity but also underscores the enduring importance of studying ancient responses to environmental change.","Archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast.

Partial Lunar Eclipse — July 6, 2028

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE — December 31, 2028

This will align with New Year’s Eve, offering a second dramatic Blood Moon in just over three years.





On the night of September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory — an 82-minute stretch of totality that will turn the Moon a vivid red. The event will be visible from all seven emirates, with global livestreams and local public viewings set to make the spectacle accessible to millions.A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow — the umbra — across the Moon’s surface. During this alignment, sunlight bends through the Earth’s atmosphere, scattering blue light and allowing red tones to reach and reflect off the Moon, creating the phenomenon popularly known as a Blood Moon.This particular eclipse stands out for two reasons:The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG) emphasizes that this combination of extended totality and widespread visibility makes the September 7 eclipse especially significant.The celestial spectacle will unfold over almost five and a half hours, beginning with the faint penumbral eclipse, progressing through the partial phases, and culminating in the most visually dramatic stage, totality, when the Moon will be completely immersed in Earth’s umbra and appear red in color.This breathtaking phase will be fully visible across all seven emirates, starting in the late evening and continuing past 10:30 PM.During this 82-minute window, the Moon will take on varying shades of red depending on atmospheric conditions, dust levels, and light pollution.The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), founded in 2000, has played a central role in popularising astronomy and space science across the Middle East. Over the past two decades, it has established itself as the region’s leading authority in the field, offering expert consultancy to government bodies and major private-sector institutions.DAG actively promotes public engagement with astronomy through a range of initiatives, including outdoor astronomical observations, public lectures, exhibitions, and conferences. The group also maintains an in-house resource centre and leverages social media to reach a wider audience. Dedicated observing sites further support its mission of making the night sky accessible to all.In line with this mission, DAG will host a public viewing event in Dubai, offering telescopes, expert guidance, and group observation sessions. Event details, including the venue and registration process, will be announced soon.A special highlight of the event will be a curated photo moment capturing the Blood Moon as it rises behind the Burj Khalifa, in collaboration with acclaimed photographer Rami Dibo.To include international audiences, DAG will host a global livestream, featuring:This coordinated broadcast aims to connect skywatchers around the world in a shared experience of the eclipse.Lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no glasses or filters are needed.

The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died.

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

A former Meta top employee has revealed Mark Zuckerberg 's ‘unusual’ executive mandate. An upcoming memoir by former head of global affairs at Meta, Nick Clegg, reveals an unusual and intense side of the Facebook co-founder, detailing how he encouraged his senior leaders to engage in mixed martial arts (MMA) training with him.“Mark’s commitment to MMA is so strong that he insisted one morning, during a management offsite, that some of his most senior executives join him for a training session,” Clegg writes in his new book.Clegg recounts his experience on the mat, where he found himself in a submission hold with his deputy, Joel Kaplan, in a move known as the ""Domination Mount,” which he described as ""too close for comfort.""The Meta CEO's martial arts hobby became widely known after he began competing in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments. In the past, he has shared several photos of himself with various MMA fighters and shared the mat with some of them.In 2023, Zuckerberg built an MMA octagon in the backyard of his home, which his wife, Priscilla Chan, did not like. Zuckerberg took to Instagram to share a humorous text exchange with his wife after he built the octagon in the backyard which did not receive a warm welcome from Chan.Her reaction, shared via WhatsApp, was swift and to the point. “I have been working on that grass for two years,” she scolded her billionaire husband.The addition fueled speculation about his much-discussed “cage match” with Elon Musk .
