A night out that’s fueling rumors and speculation



Marcus Jordan Calls Dad Michael's Reaction to Larsa Pippen Relationship 'Playful'

Larsa Pippen opens up about life after Marcus Jordan split

After making headlines recently with his relationship with Larsa Pippen , NBA legend Michael Jordan's son, Marcus Jordan , is once again in the spotlight. This time, he has turned quite a number of heads by stepping out with Nicole Murphy , the former wife of comedy icon Eddie Murphy . Their night out has sparked new interest in his personal life, leaving fans and the media buzzing about this latest twist.Let us take a look at everything that we know so far about the rendezvous between Marcus Jordan and Nicole Murphy.After his high-profile relationship with Larsa Pippen, Marcus Jordan, the son of Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan, has sparked fresh attention by stepping out with Nicole Murphy, former wife of comedy icon Eddie Murphy. The 32-year-old Jordan, who had a much-publicized on-and-off relationship with Larsa, the ex-wife of his father’s longtime teammate Scottie Pippen, seems to have moved on.On Friday night, Marcus was seen enjoying a night out at a nightclub with Nicole Murphy, an actress and model who was married to Eddie Murphy from 1993 to 2005. Despite the night being captured in several photos and videos from club-goers, Marcus shared the moments on his Instagram story, but notably, Nicole was absent from his own posts. Instead, it was bystanders who managed to snap pictures of the duo together, sending rumors into overdrive.Nicole, who shares five children with Eddie, filed for divorce in 2005, but still retains his last name. Now, with this new pairing hitting the headlines, it’s clear Marcus Jordan's love life remains a captivating subject of public curiosity.Also Read: Kevin Durant shares two-word compliment for LSU’s Mikaylah Williams after stellar performance As Marcus Jordan soaked up Miami’s vibrant nightlife on a Friday evening, Larsa Pippen was embracing the freedom of single life. After a turbulent, on-again, off-again relationship that ended earlier this year, Pippen opened up to PEOPLE about navigating life as a single woman. That's how and why we are seeing her with Marcus.From her words, it’s clear that she and Marcus have no ongoing communication, though it seems their split wasn't marked by animosity. Instead, it appears they've simply moved on, each focusing on their own paths.“I sleep like a baby and I feel like single life should be appreciated more. ... I feel like when people break up, it's like I can love you from a distance. ... I already feel full from my last relationship,"" Pippen said. ""I need to just focus on other things at this point. I am working, I am enjoying my family time. I'm good."" (via: Sportskeeda)Whether Marcus Jordan is dating Eddie Murphy’s ex-wife or just out for a casual night, Larsa Pippen isn’t really bothered by all of that. She seems to be doing just fine, remaining calm and collected while the headlines swirl around her. It’s refreshing to see her focus on her own journey, unfazed by the gossip and speculation. As the story unfolds, we’re left to wonder how it will all play out, but for now, Pippen is letting her confidence speak louder than the drama.","Marcus Jordan, son of Michael Jordan, was spotted with Nicole Murphy, Eddie Murphy's ex-wife.

"Luigi Mangione caught at McDonald’s: The $60,000 question — Who’s getting rewarded for catching suspect, and when?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/luigi-mangione-caught-at-mcdonalds-the-60000-question-whos-getting-rewarded-for-catching-suspect-and-when/articleshow/116194363.cms,"The police have not released the identity of the McDonald’s customer or the employee who helped make the arrest possible.

The nationwide manhunt for the suspect who murdered UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson ended in a place that’s as American as apple pie: a McDonald's. But while Luigi Mangione ’s arrest in Altoona, Pennsylvania, brought relief to authorities, it’s still unclear who will actually claim the $60,000 reward offered for his capture—and it could take a lot longer than you think.It all started innocuously enough when a customer at the McDonald's noticed Mangione, 26, sitting down to a meal and—being the vigilant citizen they were—alerted a staff member. That call to the police set off a chain of events that culminated in Mangione’s arrest and charges in the high-profile killing of Thompson, 50, outside a Manhattan hotel earlier this week.But here’s where things get tricky: despite the considerable reward money—$60,000 from the FBI and NYPD Crime Stoppers combined—there’s no guarantee anyone will be cashing that check anytime soon.As per the report by CNN, when it comes to crime tip rewards, things aren’t as simple as just ""seeing something, saying something."" You can’t just call in a tip and expect to waltz into the local police station to collect your money. In this case, the FBI’s reward stipulates that the tip must lead to the ""arrest and conviction"" of the suspect. That’s right—arrest and conviction.As for the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers reward, it’s similar but with a key twist. The tip must not only lead to an arrest but also to an indictment before any reward money is disbursed. It gets even more complicated when the tipster’s anonymity is involved.The police have not released the identity of the McDonald’s customer or the employee who helped make the arrest possible, and it's unclear if they will ever step forward to claim their cut.One thing’s clear: even if the tipsters do come forward, the process to claim their reward could take months. The NYPD Police Foundation, which handles the Crime Stoppers payouts, has a committee that reviews the case before making a decision. That means no one is getting rich overnight, despite how heroic their actions may seem.In larger cases—like those involving international terrorists or FBI Most Wanted fugitives—things are even more complex. The FBI has a separate program, ""Rewards for Justice,"" where nominees (who cannot nominate themselves) must be put forward by a US investigating agency. But the Thompson case isn’t on that level—yet.","Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a McDonald's customer tipped off police.

(AP)

From space station to real-life suspicion

Digital footprints and a descent into darkness

Luigi Mangione , a 26-year-old former Ivy League student, has been arrested and charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson . The shocking case has taken an unexpected turn, as Mangione’s past as a participant in an online gaming group has drawn eerie parallels to the crime.Mangione, who once played the popular assassin video game 'Among Us' with fellow students at the University of Pennsylvania, was apprehended Monday morning at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. A vigilant employee recognized him and alerted authorities. Mangione was carrying a 3D-printed firearm , a fake ID, a passport, and a handwritten manifesto that police say reveals his motivation.He faces multiple charges in both Pennsylvania and New York, including murder, possession of a weapon, and forgery.Among Us, a wildly popular multiplayer game, involves players assuming the roles of “crewmates” or a secret “killer” aboard a spaceship. The goal? The killer must eliminate crewmates without being caught, while others attempt to unmask the culprit.Alejandro Romero, a college friend of Mangione and fellow gamer, expressed disbelief at the news. “I just found it extremely ironic that, you know, we were in this game and there could actually be a true killer among us,” Romero told NBC News.Romero described Mangione as a “typical frat guy” who didn’t stand out during their college years but admitted that questions about Mangione’s online behavior post-2020 are now haunting their friend group.The game, widely beloved for its colorful, cartoonish characters and whodunit mechanics, surged in popularity during the pandemic. But the real-life parallel between the game’s premise and Mangione’s alleged crime has cast a dark shadow over the memories of those who once gamed with him.Romero described Mangione as a typical college student, blending in with his peers. ""He just fit a mold,"" Romero said. ""He seemed like any other normal frat dude."" However, in the years following college, Mangione’s online activity began to raise questions.After graduating during the chaos of the pandemic, Mangione’s life seemed to veer off course.A review of his digital footprint revealed that he had reviewed Ted Kaczynski’s Industrial Society and Its Future, better known as the “Unabomber Manifesto,” and became increasingly active on X (formerly Twitter) in 2021 after a five-year hiatus. The shift in his online persona has left Romero and others from their friend group struggling to piece together how this ""normal"" college student could now face such grave accusations.In a statement on X, Mangione's family expressed shock and devastation, offering prayers for Thompson's family and asking for privacy during this time.New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed that Mangione’s 3D-printed firearm and manifesto are under investigation as authorities work to understand his motives.For those who knew him, the arrest has upended their perception of a man they once considered unremarkable. “I didn’t speak to anyone today who wasn’t already aware of what had happened,” Romero said. ""It feels surreal.""","Luigi Mangione, 26, has been arrested and charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours while exhibiting no signs of anxiety.The contest took place at a shopping centre in Chongqing municipality on November 29, as reported by Jimu News.Ten contestants, selected from 100 applicants, were invited to the mall to participate in the competition, which required them to spend eight hours on a designated new bed. Before the contest, they surrendered their mobile phones and were prohibited from using any other electronic devices, including iPads and laptops, the South China Morning Post reported.In emergency situations, participants could use older mobile phone models with only calling capabilities, provided by the competition organisers, to contact their families.They were also required to adhere to a bed restriction rule, which allowed them to leave the bed for toilet breaks, but limited them to a maximum of five minutes each time.The organisers set a quota for the total amount of time contestants could be away from their beds throughout the eight-hour period, although this detail was not disclosed in the news report.Drinks and meals were provided, and participants were instructed to consume them in bed.In addition to being prohibited from using their mobile phones, competitors were not allowed to fall into a deep sleep or exhibit anxiety. They wore wrist straps to monitor their sleep quality and anxiety levels.Most contestants spent their time reading books or simply resting with their eyes closed.Ultimately, after verification by event officials, a woman surnamed Dong was declared the champion, achieving a comprehensive score of 88.99 out of 100. The organisers noted that she spent the longest time in bed, did not experience deep sleep, and displayed the lowest level of anxiety.The 10,000-yuan prizewinner donned pyjamas for the competition, earning her the nickname “pyjama sister” on mainland social media as the no-mobile-phone race gained viral attention online.Dong is a sales manager at a finance firm. In her spare time, she typically tutors her child and rarely browses her mobile phone aimlessly.The identity of the company sponsoring the competition and the purpose behind holding this event, which occurred in a mattress and bedding shop within the mall, remains undisclosed.","A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.The Wales family welcomed a new cocker spaniel named Orla in 2020. James Middleton bred the dog. This followed the death of their previous dog, Lupo.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

Users across X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit have expressed solidarity, with some regarding him as a hero.Authorities apprehended Mangione in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a McDonald's worker identified him. He faces firearms charges and remains a key suspect in Thompson's death. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny confirmed finding a ghost gun, suppressor, and anti-healthcare system manifesto in his possession, Newsweek reported.Social media's response to the executive's public killing has been notably casual, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with American healthcare across political divisions.Following police disclosure of Mangione's identity, his social media accounts - @PepMangione on X and @luigi.from.fiji on Instagram - attracted thousands of new followers. Supporters have left encouraging messages on his previous posts.Luigi Mangione's Instagram account, @luigi.from.fiji, sees a surge in followers, reaching 21.5K amid the growing #FreeLuigi movement on social media. The #FreeLuigi hashtag has gained traction on X, with users portraying him as an anti-establishment figure. Another user posted, ""he's only guilty of being hot. #FreeLuigi,"" exemplifying how many focus on his appearance rather than the alleged crime.One of the users stated, ""Now the real news should be who is the class traitor that snitched on Luigi Mangione""Popular culture references have fuelled the reaction.

These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.

Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

“Daily walks help clear your mind,”

Take a look at the video here



What Musk said about Optimus’ latest features



“Optimus can now walk on highly variable ground using neural nets to control its electric limbs. Join @Tesla if you want to work on interesting real-world AI systems.”

“Tesla is where real-world AI is happening. These runs are on mulched ground, where I’ve myself slipped before. What’s really crazy here is that for these, Optimus is actually blind! Keeping its balance without video (yet), only other on-board sensors are consumed by a neural net running in ~2-3ms on its embedded computer.

More exciting work happening on:

- adding Vision so it can better plan ahead

- making the gait look more natural on such rough terrain

- making it more responsive to velocity/direction commands

- learning how to fall to minimise damage when unavoidable (and stand back up)

Join us to work on fascinating reinforcement learning, imitation learning, foundation nets for robotics & more to bring Optimus to everyone fast. We’re doing it.""

“I forgot to mention that Optimus was doing this while “blindfolded”. We haven’t yet made vision part of the control loop for uneven terrain. Optimus robots are regularly cruising around our workplace in Palo Alto where vision is used for static & dynamic object avoidance.”","Optimus can now walk on highly variable ground using neural nets to control its electric limbs.

How Google’s ‘quantum leap’ may have fuelled multiverse theory with its Willow chip’s 'record',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-googles-quantum-leap-may-have-fuelled-multiverse-theory-with-its-willow-chips-record/articleshow/116181715.cms,"Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10^25 or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.

What is quantum, quantum computing and multiverse

In simpler terms:

Why do we need Quantum computing

The mind-boggling concept of a multiverse – where our universe is just one of many – may have taken a giant leap toward reality. Google announced a groundbreaking achievement in quantum computing, unveiling the Willow quantum computing chip that, it claims, is capable of solving problems in mere minutes that would take even the most powerful supercomputers longer than the age of the universe to crack.In its explanation, Google mentioned physicist David Deutsch’s theory of universes, according to which quantum computations occur in many parallel universes simultaneously. Here’s what Google said:Before we understand what Google meant, let’s just have a look at the concepts of Physics.A quantum is the smallest unit of a physical phenomenon or property that can be measured, and the study is called quantum mechanics – a branch of physics that explains the properties of atoms, molecules and their particles, such as electrons, protons, neutrons.The concept of multiverse is based on the existence of multiple, possibly infinite, universes, each with its own unique properties, physical laws and events and comes under quantum mechanics.Deutsch, a pioneer in quantum computing, proposed that quantum computations occur in many parallel universes simultaneously. This idea, rooted in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, suggests that every quantum event spawns multiple universes where each possible outcome unfolds. This means that all possible outcomes of quantum events occur simultaneously in different branches of the multiverse.Imagine you’re facing a choice -- of choosing one of the multiple paths to reach your house. In our universe, you pick one path but in the multiverse idea, another “you” in a parallel universe takes the other path.Quantum computers , according to this notion, could somehow access the results from both universes, giving them incredible power, which is where Quantum computing comes as a way to solve complex problems using this 'power'.Willow's speed seems to support this theory. By tapping into the vast computational 'power' of parallel universes, it has achieved a feat deemed impossible by classical computing standards.All said, the existence of the multiverse remains a theoretical concept and Quantum computing is in a nascent stage with no real-world applications as of now.Quantum computing is a way to solve complex problems at an incredibly fast speed as compared to a regular computer. Consider a regular computer as a bicycle that is great for everyday tasks and a Quantum computer a spaceship, capable of incredible things but still under development.It can help in discovering new drugs and materials by simulating molecules with incredible accuracy and speed, or develop super-fast artificial intelligence leading to breakthroughs in machine learning.To read more about Google Willow, follow this link","Willow performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10^25 or 10 septillion years. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116181672,imgsize-45496,width-400,resizemode-4/116181672.jpg"

T-Series Chairman and Managing Director Bhushan Kumar and MrBeast, the world’s most-followed YouTuber, recently met in a surprising turn of events that shocked fans worldwide. After years of competitive rivalry in the race to top YouTube’s subscriber list, the two decided to subscribe to each other's channels, marking the end of their ""sub-race."" This moment has since gone viral, with some social media users calling it the “biggest collab ever.”The encounter between MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) and Bhushan Kumar was shared by T-Series on Instagram, where the two discussed the long-standing rivalry between their channels. MrBeast humorously revealed that he flew to India specifically to propose a unique deal to Kumar: “If you subscribe to me, I will subscribe to T-Series.” Kumar eagerly agreed, pressing the subscribe button on MrBeast's channel. Then, he requested that MrBeast do the same for T-Series.MrBeast initially played a prank, claiming his phone had died and he would subscribe later, leaving viewers in suspense. However, moments later, he followed through, subscribing to T-Series and officially declaring an end to the ""years of sub-race"" between the two YouTube giants.The video quickly went viral, sparking an outpouring of reactions from fans. Many fans expressed their excitement, with one person humorously referencing the long wait for the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, saying, ""We got MrBeast and T-Series subscribing to each other before GTA 6."" Others praised the collaboration, with one user stating, “The world is not for competition, it's for collaboration!!” Another declared, “This is the biggest collab ever.” The post was flooded with fire and heart emojis from followers of both channels.The playful interaction between the two stars comes after months of back-and-forth rivalry, with MrBeast and T-Series frequently battling for the top spot in terms of YouTube subscribers. Earlier this year, MrBeast even challenged Bhushan Kumar to a boxing match, which led to a virtual war between their fan bases. The competition has kept fans on edge as both channels vied for dominance.As of now, MrBeast holds the title of the most-subscribed YouTube channel and the most-followed individual on the platform, while T-Series, India’s largest record label and film production company, ranks second.The moment symbolises more than just a simple YouTube interaction; it highlights the importance of collaboration over competition. What began as a rivalry between two of YouTube’s most influential entities has now evolved into a gesture of mutual respect and camaraderie, demonstrating that even in a competitive space, cooperation can be more rewarding than constant contention. This move has further solidified the idea that even in the most competitive arenas, collaboration can lead to incredible outcomes.","Bhushan Kumar and MrBeast, the world's most-followed YouTuber and T-Series, recently met in a surprising turn of events.

Benefits for Users

The translucent bar creates a smoother visual transition between the UI elements and the video content.

The transparency can make the app feel less cluttered and provide a sense of increased space.

The YouTube mobile app is receiving a subtle but noticeable update that streamlines the user interface. Google is rolling out a translucent bottom bar design for both Android and iOS devices.This new design replaces the solid-coloured bottom bar with a transparent one. The bar allows the background content, such as video thumbnails or the ""You"" tab background, to subtly show through, creating a more visually appealing and immersive experience.The change is primarily aesthetic, but it offers a few potential benefits:The new translucent bottom bar is rolling out to users globally. However, it may take some time for everyone to see the update on their devices.Recently, YouTube introduced the Subscribe button in its YouTube TV app. Previously, users had to navigate to a channel's page to subscribe. The new button provides a more convenient and streamlined way to subscribe to channels while watching videos.By placing the ""Subscribe"" button in a more prominent location, YouTube aims to encourage more users to subscribe to their preferred channels and stay updated with the latest content.","The YouTube mobile app is receiving a subtle but noticeable update that streamlines the user interface.

CM Punk Shares Footage of Wyatt Sicks and Final Testament Fighting in the Ring

The Wyatt Sicks vs. The Final Testament & The Miz: Raw Hype Package

CM Punk is one of the few WWE wrestlers who is extremely active on social media. This was seen extensively during his feud with Drew McIntyre. Although the feud has finally come to an end, his activity on social media hasn’t decreased one bit. In a recent post however, Punk accidentally ended up sharing a small clip of two factions duking it out in the ring, in light of their upcoming encounter.At this point, readers would do well to acknowledge that a lot of what they see in WWE is scripted. So, before these fights are showcased in front of the audience, the wrestlers extensively practice their moves in the ring. It’s also worth noting that the moves that these wrestlers execute in the ring are extremely dangerous and should not be executed at home under any circumstances.The post that CM Punk made was a rather innocent post, where the screen in the background showed footage of the Wyatt Sicks and the Final Testament practising their moves in the ring. These two stables have been feuding for a while now, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks.Eagle eyed fans were quick to spot that on the Instagram story and screenshots started spreading like wildfire. Although it’s not a spoiler of sorts, nor does it affect a storyline, it does give everyone an insight into the professional lives of these wrestlers.The feud between Wyatt Sicks and The Final Testament sparked this week on RAW where Karrion Kross and his table managed to secure a win over the Wyatt Sicks after a heated fight in the ring, which included interference from Scarlett and the long-awaited return of Paul Ellerling. How WWE Creative looks to channel this feud in the coming days still remains to be seen. Given the supernatural aura around both these factions, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Creative team borrowing some supernatural and psychological elements that were very common with the late Bray Wyatt and The Undertaker.They’ve already started to add that element to it, after Ellering used a “supernatural” power to take down Uncle Howdy as revenge. This was in retaliation to the incident that happened on October 21’s RAW where Uncle Howdy took down Ellering using his Mandible Claw.This overall incident involving CM Punk could be looked at from another angle though. Since WWE fans love breaking down such instances, it’s possible that the Creative team was looking to incite a new level of curiosity in the ongoing feud on the Red Brand in the Stamford-based promotion.Also read: CM Punk says he is confused about Seth Rollins' hatred: “I don’t hate Seth at all”","CM Punk accidentally shared footage of the Wyatt Sicks and The Final Testament fighting in the ring.

Hulk Hogan’s 1982 wrestling card sold for $132,000



WWE legend Hulk Hogan has a series of stellar accolades to his name. The 71-year-old legend has recently added another stunning record to shine his resume. Hogan’s 1982 wrestling card has claimed a whopping $132,000 in sales proving that the stardom of the WWE icon is still intact and will continue in the years to come as arguably the historic significance of the superstar has been second to none.Hulk Hogan's 1982 Wrestling All-Stars Series A card made history this weekend by selling for $132,000 at Heritage Auctions . The Hogan card has set a new record for the highest-priced wrestling card ever. This PSA 9 Mint card, one of only 17 in existence, surpassed the previous record held by The Rock's 2022 Black Prizm 1/1 card, which sold for $126,000.The card is part of the first-ever standard American wrestling card set, originally distributed through mail order via Wrestling News magazine in limited quantities of just 2,000 sets.The sale of Hogan’s 1982 Wrestling All-Stars card has seen a dramatic rise in value. For context, a similar PSA 9 card sold for just $4,050 in April 2020. This sharp increase has drawn comparisons to other iconic sports cards. Sports collector David Peck compared it to the legendary 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card, calling it ""the 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle of wrestling cards.""Heritage Auctions conducted the event for collections to bid on the memorabilia. “Even in retirement, Hulk Hogan remains one of professional wrestling's biggest stars and attractions,” Heritage Auctions wrote in the description of the card.“While he began his wrestling career in the professional ranks in 1977, it wasn't until 1983 when he truly gained gained worldwide recognition after signing with Vince McMahon and the WWF (World Wrestling Federation). He was a perennial headliner in WWF's annual flagship ‘Wrestlemania’ event and always considered one of its top draws. His series of celebrated ring duels with Andre the Giant were legendary in wrestling circles. Since retiring, Hogan continues to keep his persona and personality larger than life with occasional acting roles.”The description added, “Offered is a 1982 PWE Wrestling All Stars card featuring Hulk right before his career really took off. This brightly colored, high-grade example of card #2 from the '82 PWE Series A release exhibits good centering, unchipped full-bleed borders, four strong corners, and a reverse that's clean as a whistle. Graded PSA Mint 9. Of the 435 examples found in the PSA Pop Report, this is one of only 17 cards graded MINT with none rated higher.”Also Read: Sting's Top Controversial moments: Hulk Hogan to Triple H and more Hogan’s memorabilia has always been valuable. In 2022, Hogan's card set a record when a 1982 NJPW Cosmos set sold for $51,600. The card, graded GEM MT 10, was in near-perfect condition. Again, in 2023, a 1982 Hogan All-Stars card with a BGS 9.5 grade surpassed that sale, reaching $52,840.","Hulk Hogan's 1982 Wrestling All-Stars Series A card made history by selling for $132,000 at Heritage Auctions.

While it may not be street-legal, it has everything to make any Batman fan feel like Bruce Wayne himself.He hasn't said much about the Batmobile since the buzz about his new toy.
