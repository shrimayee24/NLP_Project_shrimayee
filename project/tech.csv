As we know, the laugh originates near a blocked-off tunnel section in downtown Los Santos. Additional sounds: Killing rats triggers splash noises, and strange breathing can be heard in the tunnels.

For so many years, almost every die-hard Grand Theft Auto V fan has encountered eerie and some kind of unexplained phenomena in the game, from ghostly apparitions to cryptic UFO sightings. Among all these mysteries, one of the creepiest ones is the sewer laughs, which players have witnessed in the map of Los Santos. Recently this long-standing mystery has been solved, and it reveals a clever nod to an urban legend from GTA 4; it’s the Ratman myth. The discovery of this mystery also shows us how the developer, i.e., Rockstar Games, has always done a wonderful job on their player-driven storytelling.The Ratman myth first emerged in GTA 4, where players reported sightings of a rat-like humanoid creature that was lurking around Liberty City’s subway tunnels. Here are a few other things that players have concluded about the Ratman myth:Despite a series of extensive and long searches, there was no solid evidence of Ratman being found in GTA, which leaves the myth unresolved. However, Rockstar seemingly revived the legend in GTA V through subtle audio cues.In Grand Theft Auto V, while the players were exploring the maintenance tunnels beneath Los Santos, they reported an unsettling laughter. Gator Keys, one of the famous YouTubers, recently uncovered the truth by confirming the audio file labeled as “H=hobo laugh” is an intentional sound. This discovery links to the GTA 4’s Ratman mystery by suggesting that Rockstar Games has incorporated this fan-made myth as an Easter egg. Here are the few key details, which include:This nod from the GTA 4 fan base myths demonstrates the commitment of Rockstar Games to reward all their dedicated players with layered storytelling.","In Grand Theft Auto V, while the players were exploring the maintenance tunnels beneath Los Santos, they reported an unsettling laughter.

AI in product experience and customer support: Benefits and cautions



Role of AI in creativity and coding: assisting, not replacing humans



Sridhar Vembu’s balanced AI: Experiment, enhance, and ensure human oversight

Sridhar Vembu , the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation , has provided valuable insights into the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern workplaces and business processes. He acknowledges AI’s immense potential to accelerate learning, streamline workflows, and enhance overall product and service experiences, making operations more efficient and data-driven. However, Vembu cautions that over-reliance on AI, misuse, or unmonitored implementation can reduce, or even reverse, the expected productivity gains, creating unforeseen challenges.His perspective underscores the critical importance of responsible AI adoption , emphasising human oversight, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation of AI systems. By balancing technology with careful management, businesses can harness AI’s advantages while mitigating risks and ensuring sustainable growth.Vembu revealed his personal AI habits in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2025, describing himself as a “moderate to heavy” user.A unique approach he follows is having multiple AI systems debate and critique each other’s outputs, which he believes enhances understanding and critical thinking.Vembu highlighted that AI can significantly enhance product experiences and improve customer service efficiency:Tools like Grok in X show how AI can streamline user interaction and provide quicker solutions.AI can support customer service agents, enabling faster responses and more efficient handling of queries.However, he warns against allowing AI to fully replace human agents. Passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure is unethical and risks damaging trust.Vembu emphasised that AI should assist rather than replace human creativity:He advises against using AI to create original content independently.Copying and pasting AI-generated responses without human review or disclosure is considered unprofessional.AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not a substitute for critical thinking, creativity, or decision-making.Vembu also discussed AI in software development, pointing out potential risks and limitations:AI-generated code must undergo comprehensive compliance, privacy, and security reviews. Skipping these processes can undermine software quality, compromise security, and violate professional standards.In some instances, these verification steps may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage, and improper use could even slow development.Zoho programmers are encouraged to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a complete replacement for human coding judgement.Vembu’s philosophy focuses on moderation, experimentation, and evaluation:Use AI to enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving, not as a full substitute for human expertise.Conduct experiments, gather real-world data, and refine AI practices based on outcomes.Ensure human oversight and ethical responsibility in all AI-driven processes.This approach ensures AI serves as a complement to human skill, fostering innovation while maintaining accountability.","Sridhar Vembu is the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation.

Republican Party members are not having it with Gavin Newsom's latest stunt

Gavin Newsom has thrown caution to the wind and posted an AI image of himself being blessed by MAGA celebs like Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, and the late WWE wrestling legend- Hulk Hogan . Of course, this has the Republican base rattled, but Newsom is hardly phased, and is enjoying getting under his opponents' skin. The 57-year-old Governor of California has been a Democratic Party member since the 90s and often criticizes Donald Trump and MAGA.Gavin Newsom posted an AI picture of himself getting blessed by Donald Trump's celeb squad - Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson, and the late Hulk Hogan . On top of that, Hulk is seen with a halo on his head and angel wings to go along with the whole image, probably due to his late status. He then used the caption of ""so nice,"" to describe the picture, and of course, social media is all over it.The AI-generated image was in line with a few images Trump himself sometimes posts- Trump being blessed by other deceased celebrities, Trump as the Pope, and one where Jesus himself is seen blessing the POTUS. All these AI-generated images even get posted from the official White House account on X (formerly Twitter), and Newsom is seemingly just keeping the trend going.The Republican Party is not taking too kindly to Gavin Newsom's latest stunt. Many have called out the Governor of California for using such images, especially given the use of AI to generate images of the late wrestling star Hulk Hogan . But Newsom is not backing down, in fact, he is taking it even further.Newsom's official X (formerly Twitter) account not only kept the old image up of him being blessed by the MAGA squad. He then went and added a reply to a Republican rebuking him- this time he quote-tweeted a post from the official White House account, where Trump is reimagined as the Pope with the help of AI. They captioned the post with, ""oops our bad, sorry. meant to post this.""

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused the company of racism.

Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily from September 1, 2025, as part of updates aimed at easing city traffic congestion and encouraging public transport use. The new rules also scrap the daily and monthly fee caps, marking major changes for regular commuters across the capital.From September 1, 2025, motorists in Abu Dhabi will pay Dh4 for each trip through Darb toll gates between 3pm and 7pm (Monday to Saturday), in addition to the unchanged morning window of 7am to 9am. Tolls are not charged outside these peak periods, nor on Sundays and public holidays. Abu Dhabi’s four main toll gates are at Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Al Maqta Bridge, and Musaffah Bridge, key entrance points to the city. These changes are managed by Q Mobility, under the Department of Municipalities and Transport.A major update is the removal of daily and monthly fee limits, meaning motorists will pay the Dh4 charge each time they use a toll gate during charging hours. Previously, charges could not exceed Dh16 per day, while monthly caps depended on how many vehicles a user owned. With caps abolished, high-frequency users should budget accordingly.Exemption policies remain unchanged for people with disabilities, low-income families, senior citizens, and retirees. The extension and cap removal are intended to improve peak hour traffic flow, reduce congestion, and prompt more commuters to consider public transit, especially given the city’s ongoing population boom. Abu Dhabi’s population now exceeds 4.1 million, up 51% in a decade; surging vehicle registrations and rapid development underscore the importance of adaptive traffic management strategies in the emirate.With extended toll hours and the removal of daily and monthly payment limits, Abu Dhabi is signaling a shift toward tighter congestion control and stronger incentives for public transport. Motorists are urged to adjust their travel habits and budgets as these new rules take effect.","Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily from September 1, 2025.

Dubai International Airport has launched a cutting-edge, AI-powered corridor that allows travellers to bypass traditional passport control in seconds. Unveiled by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the new system can process multiple passengers simultaneously—marking a global first in airport immigration technology and advancing Dubai’s vision for seamless, document-free travel.Dubai has introduced the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered immigration corridor at Dubai International Airport (DXB), which has retained its title as the busiest international airport for the 11th consecutive year. The initiative was officially announced by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of the GDRFA.This innovation enables passengers to walk across a special passage—referred to internally as the “red carpet”—to complete immigration formalities without stopping or presenting travel documents. Up to ten passengers can pass through at the same time, a significant improvement over the traditional one-passenger-at-a-time model.The AI corridor is a major step within Dubai’s broader “travel without borders” strategy. It is designed as part of a larger integrated system aimed at providing faster, smoother, and more secure transit for travellers.The AI corridor processes passenger information automatically and in real time.Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system identifies and verifies travellers before they reach the immigration checkpoint, allowing them to walk through without presenting ID or stopping for inspection.Despite the speed and simplicity, security is not compromised. The system includes built-in mechanisms that flag any suspicious passports and immediately route them to forgery experts for review. This ensures robust screening while reducing manual workload and queue times.As a result, overall processing capacity has doubled, helping reduce congestion and improving efficiency during high-traffic periods.Lieutenant General Al Marri highlighted that DXB is not merely a transit point but a prominent international gateway that reflects the UAE’s progressive identity and hospitality. The launch of the AI-powered corridor reinforces Dubai’s standing as a hub of technological innovation and operational excellence.He further stated that the GDRFA’s work aligns with a long-term innovation roadmap that focuses on leveraging technology to modernise and streamline border control procedures. The shift toward automated, document-free travel is expected to become a defining feature of global air travel, with Dubai leading that transformation.","Dubai's AI-powered immigration corridor at DXB processes ten passengers at once, enabling seamless, document-free entry using biometric verification.

‘Feels like a good book’: Vivek Ramaswamy pokes fun of ‘funniest gift’ received on birthday; jests about NYC race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/feels-like-a-good-book-vivek-ramaswamy-pokes-fun-of-funniest-gift-received-on-birthday-jests-about-nyc-race/articleshow/123358655.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy pokes fun of ‘funniest gift’ received on birthday





Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy used his 40th birthday to deliver a political punchline that quickly spread online.Sharing a video on X, Ramaswamy showed off what he called the “funniest gift” from his high school friend. The book, titled 'Why Socialism Works', turned out to be blank inside, every page simply read, “It Doesn’t. ”In the clip, Ramaswamy flips through the book with a grin, remarking: “Feels like a good book for maybe some of the opponents in the New York mayoral race, but that’s not my business.”Posting the video, he added a pointed caption: “Funniest gift I got for my 40th birthday, from my high school buddy Cory Ingle. Feels like there are some mayoral candidates in NYC who’d do well to get this.”The post quickly drew laughs and light-hearted replies. One user quipped, “I hope the author made a lot of money selling that book lol.” Another wrote, “We need this for every politician in DC too.”Others kept it simple, wishing him a happy birthday while enjoying the joke.The timing of the post also tied neatly into Ramaswamy’s campaign messaging. The Indian-origin billionaire, who resigned from the department of government efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year to run for Ohio governor in 2026, has leaned heavily on a capitalism-versus-socialism theme.His super PAC, Victors Not Victims, recently funded a Times Square billboard warning New Yorkers about mayoral contender Zohran Mamdani, branding him a “radical socialist” while casting Ramaswamy as a defender of “freedom.”Sharing the poster on X, Ramaswamy wrote, ""Capitalism defeats socialism. There’s a better way: move to Ohio.""Yet even as he sharpened his ideological attack, Ramaswamy urged critics to avoid personal jibes at Mamdani’s Ugandan-Indian background. Writing in an op-ed published in the New York Post, he said, “The real problem with Mamdani isn’t his race or religion. It’s his anti-capitalist worldview and his policies that risk destroying our nation’s largest city.”For Ramaswamy, the gag gift doubled as both a birthday laugh and another jab in a campaign built on contrasting socialism with what he describes as the “revival of the American dream” in Ohio.","Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy pokes fun of ‘funniest gift’ received on birthday.

The Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia has formally launched a centralized translation service through its e-Litigation platform, streamlining all judicial translation processes to support efficient legal communication and case handling.The Unified Translation Center is now operational on the e-Litigation platform, enabling centralized management of judicial translation requests. The service encompasses the entire translation process, from the initial request by a beneficiary to completion, within a single digital workflow.The platform automates the receipt of translation requests, which can originate from lawsuits or judicial departments, and coordinates their assignment to translators. It also provides tools for monitoring and supervision, ensuring the status of each request can be tracked throughout its lifecycle.The integration allows beneficiaries, such as litigants, legal representatives, and courts, to follow the progress of their translation requests step-by-step, aiming to improve the quality, speed, and efficiency of translation services within judicial procedures.The Unified Translation Center, under the Ministry of Justice, offers remote interpretation services for non-Arabic speakers during court hearings.By utilizing videoconferencing and the e-Litigation system, interpreters, including those specializing in sign language, can assist in real time, ensuring accurate understanding between judicial panels and individuals involved in legal proceedings who do not speak Arabic.This initiative was launched with a clear goal: to eliminate communication barriers in courtrooms and legal environments, providing transparent interpretation to safeguard due process and individual rights. It emphasizes accuracy and ensures that non-Arabic speakers are given full clarity and participation during legal procedures.The Najiz platform, which serves as the Ministry of Justice’s unified digital services portal, hosts the translation functionality. In August 2023, the Ministry introduced a dedicated feature on Najiz titled “Request for an Interpreter”. This allows non-Arabic speaking users to request translation services directly online.Najiz is part of a broader effort by the Ministry to provide comprehensive judicial services digitally, aimed at improving user experience and service accessibility.The Ministry of Justice is one of the most longstanding government entities in Saudi Arabia. Established by Royal Order in 1962, the Ministry was tasked with overseeing all courts and fulfilling their administrative and financial needs. Although it was founded in 1962, the Ministry began executing its formal duties in 1970 under the leadership of the first appointed Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bin Ali al-Harkhan, who served until 1975.Among all ministries under the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Justice is one of only three that has never undergone a name change, merger, or dissolution, the others being the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry is headquartered in Riyadh and is managed by a Minister appointed via Royal Order, who also holds membership in the Council of Ministers.The broader modernization of judicial services, including digital translation and litigation processes, is aligned with the national transformation program Saudi Vision 2030. The Ministry’s active reform phase began after the first meeting of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs in 2016, where His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, launched the Vision.As part of this alignment, the Ministry of Justice adopted thirteen strategic goals, all contributing to systemic improvements across its various sectors.These sectors include:Each plays a role in transforming legal services to be more efficient, accessible, and aligned with global standards.","The Unified Translation Center is now operational on the e-Litigation platform, enabling centralized management of judicial translation requests.

A new approach to malaria modelling

Scientific Reports

“Analysis of a Mathematical Model for Malaria Using a Data-Driven Approach”

Technologies at the core: AI and dynamic systems

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)



Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)



Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)





Implications for global health

This research demonstrates the power of AI when combined with classical epidemiological models,” said Prof. Abdessamad Tridane of UAEU. “By embedding environmental dependencies directly into the transmission functions, our model captures the complex, real-world behaviour of malaria spread, providing a more accurate and timely method for disease tracking.”

Institutional collaboration and background

United Arab Emirates University (UAEU), established in 1976 in Al Ain, is the UAE’s oldest public research university. Founded by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, it offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs across multiple disciplines.





IIT Madras Zanzibar Campus, inaugurated in November 2023, is the first international campus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Located in the Bweleo district of Zanzibar, Tanzania, the campus currently offers programs in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

In a significant step forward for global public health, researchers from United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras’ Zanzibar campus have introduced a cutting-edge, data-driven framework that accurately models and forecasts malaria transmission. By integrating artificial intelligence with mathematical modelling, this new approach aims to support early intervention and improve disease control strategies in malaria-prone regions.A collaborative research team led by Adithya Rajnarayanan, Manoj Kumar, and Professor Abdessamad Tridane has introduced a novel methodology that enhances how malaria outbreaks can be forecasted. Their work, published inby Nature, presents a comprehensive model that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with classical epidemiological frameworks to simulate malaria dynamics with higher precision.The study, titled, brings a fresh perspective to disease modelling. It incorporates temperature- and altitude-dependent variables into compartmental disease models, a method that makes the simulations more realistic and region-specific. This is particularly crucial for climate-sensitive and vulnerable areas where environmental factors heavily influence malaria transmission patterns.To boost the predictive capability of their model, the researchers employed a suite of advanced AI tools. These included:Each of these tools was used to improve the accuracy of disease forecasting, enabling the model to detect patterns in the complex interplay between environmental conditions and malaria spread.Additionally, the study introduced Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a mathematical technique that helps break down complex systems into simpler, understandable components. This was used to create a real-time infection risk metric, offering public health officials a powerful resource for early detection and targeted response.Professor Abdessamad Tridane of UAEU emphasized the importance of this integration of AI with epidemiological modelling, stating:The implications of this research are especially relevant for regions like sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 94% of global malaria cases. With over half a million malaria-related deaths each year, the need for accurate forecasting models is critical. This work offers a valuable step towards improved surveillance, early warning systems, and data-driven policymaking in the fight against malaria.This study represents a collaboration between two institutions that are expanding their global health research footprint:","Researchers from United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras’ Zanzibar campus have introduced a cutting-edge, data- driven framework that accurately models and forecasts malaria transmission.

Ajman’s ban, what it covers







Violations leading to the crackdown





Riding without helmets or safety gear

Entering roads through exits

Riding against traffic on one-way streets

Using pedestrian crossings improperly

Weaving through traffic in an unsafe manner



A broader UAE concern





What riders should know now





Electric scooters are not permitted on any public road or street in Ajman.

The ban includes all types — private, shared, or rental.

Riders are urged to follow official channels for updates on where these vehicles may be used in future.

Compliance is mandatory, and violations may result in vehicle confiscation or fines.





In a decisive move to curb traffic violations and ensure public safety, Ajman has enforced a complete ban on the use of electric scooters on public roads. This follows repeated violations and growing concerns over unsafe riding practices observed across the UAE.Ajman Police has officially prohibited the use of all types of electric scooters — both privately owned and rented — on all public roads and streets within the emirate. The decision, which is effective immediately, is aimed at addressing the increasing number of traffic violations and potential hazards involving e-scooter riders.The police emphasized that the measure is not just regulatory but a public safety initiative, urging residents to avoid riding in unauthorised areas. Riders found violating the ban may face fines or have their vehicles confiscated, although specific penalties have not yet been disclosed.This step comes shortly after Ajman Police issued a public advisory in the previous month, warning riders to comply with road safety regulations and avoid using unauthorised electric bicycles and scooters.The ban follows the release of video footage that captured a number of dangerous and illegal riding behaviours, prompting swift action by authorities. Among the most common violations:These actions not only endanger the riders themselves but also pose serious risks to pedestrians and motorists.Ajman Police highlighted that such reckless conduct is incompatible with safe road usage and undermines efforts to maintain order on the streets.Ajman’s move is part of a wider UAE-wide effort to rein in unsafe e-scooter practices. Across the country, police and transport authorities have repeatedly called on users of two-wheelers to adhere to safety guidelines and restrict usage to designated zones.In Abu Dhabi, a video recently released by the police showed three men in Kanduras riding e-scooters in unsafe, unauthorised areas, drawing public attention and fueling calls for stricter enforcement and better regulations.Similarly, in Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) and Dubai Police have launched a special unit focused on monitoring e-scooter and bicycle violations. The joint effort aims to improve compliance, reduce accidents, and make the streets safer for all.With Ajman’s full ban in place, residents and visitors should be aware of the following:Authorities across the UAE continue to stress the importance of responsible riding and adherence to safety laws, as part of a broader initiative to prevent accidents and ensure road discipline.","Ajman Police has banned the use of all electric scooters on all public roads and streets within the emirate.

The United Arab Emirates is bracing for a blistering weekend as temperatures are forecast to soar to extreme levels, reaching up to 46°C in key cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The National Center of Meteorology (NCM) warns residents and visitors to take strong precautions against the intense heat, especially during peak daytime hours. Along with the soaring temperatures, there are elevated humidity levels and blowing dust expected, further compounding the discomfort and health risks.Dubai is currently experiencing very warm conditions, with highs around 41°C and night lows remaining above 34°C, making evenings uncomfortably warm. Abu Dhabi faces similar extremes, with temperatures around 42°C and nighttime lows staying near 33°C. The forecast indicates a peak temperature of 46°C by Friday for both cities, marking one of the hottest spells of the summer.Interior parts of the UAE are seeing even higher temperatures, with some areas reaching between 42°C and 47°C. Mountainous regions remain cooler but still hot, with highs in the low to mid-30s Celsius. Coastal cities will contend with elevated humidity, pushing the heat index higher and increasing the risk of heat stress.Moderate southwesterly to northeasterly winds will occasionally increase to fresh levels at around 35 km/h, causing blowing dust and haze that can significantly reduce visibility on roads and in public outdoor spaces.Dust storms are forecast to accompany this heatwave, especially in eastern and northern parts of the country. The blowing dust will lead to poor air quality and possible respiratory irritation, prompting health alerts for sensitive groups. Drivers are advised to exercise caution as sudden dust clouds can create hazardous driving conditions.To stay safe during this period of extreme heat, authorities are emphasizing several protective measures:Employers and outdoor workers are encouraged to adjust working hours to cooler parts of the day and provide adequate rest and hydration breaks.This extreme heat period is part of a longer 14-day stretch of intense summer weather affecting the UAE, accompanied by frequent dust storms and elevated humidity, especially along coastal areas. The heatwave follows the UAE experiencing its hottest spring on record this year, with temperatures earlier in August reaching highs above 50°C in some interior locations like Sweihan.Experts attribute this pattern to broader climate change effects contributing to escalating heat intensity and duration in the Gulf region.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence.

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S.

In the following step, you'll see the status of your CGHS beneficiary ID and ABHA ID. If the details match, you can click 'Print ABHA Card' to obtain a printout.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
