PUNE: A traffic snarl on the Mumbai–Pune Expressway stranded commuters and forced industrialist Dr Sudhir Mehta to fly back to Pune by helicopter after an 8-hour wait.In posts on X, Dr Mehta wrote, “Lacs of people are stuck on the #Mumbai #Pune expressway for the last 18 hours for “one gas tanker “ . For such emergencies we need to plan exits at different points on expressway which can be opened to allow vehicles to return. ”He further suggested, “Helipads cost less than Rs 10 lacs to make and require less than one acre of open area .

Kuwait Prepares 1,700 Mosques for Ramadan 2026: Safety, Comfort and Community Focus

In the UAE, preparations at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre include expanded parking and transport services ahead of Ramadan to serve millions of visitors.

In Saudi Arabia , ministries issue pre-Ramadan guidelines to ensure mosques and prayer halls nationwide are ready and staffed throughout the month.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches, Kuwait is entering a phase of intense preparation, not only spiritually but also logistically to ensure that Muslim worshippers can observe prayers comfortably and safely. Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs has announced that around 1,700 mosques across the country’s six governorates are being readied to welcome congregations for Taraweeh (night prayers) and other Ramadan rites.The Islamic month of Ramadan is woven into social and community life in Kuwait and governments are mobilising resources to uphold religious traditions while prioritising public safety and convenience. According to reports, the Ministry is finalising maintenance and service work at nearly 1,700 mosques to ensure they are fully equipped for the influx of worshippers during Ramadan. The work includes:Maintenance teams will be on duty around the clock throughout Ramadan this year, to address issues immediately and ensure mosques remain accessible and comfortable for all worshippers.Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs is not just preparing physical spaces, it is also working in tandem with other government bodies to provide a holistic experience for worshippers during the holy month:These measures reflect a growing emphasis on not just welcoming worshippers but also ensuring their well-being and dignity during intense spiritual practice, particularly in high-capacity mosques during Taraweeh and Laylat al-Qadr.Ramadan is much more than fasting from dawn to sunset. It is a month of communal gathering, prayer, reflection and charity. Mosques become epicenters of social and spiritual life, hosting night prayers, Quran recitations, charitable distribution and community iftars. The prep work underway in Kuwait underscores the importance of mosques as community anchors.Clean, safe, well-organised prayer spaces boost participation in congregational prayers, especially for elders and families and make it easier for people across age groups to engage in the spiritual rhythm of Ramadan. Kuwait is not alone in ramping up preparations for Ramadan worshippers. Across the Gulf, ministries and religious affairs departments are undertaking similar efforts.These coordinated activities reflect a shared regional priority of preserving Ramadan as a deeply religious, safe and communal experience for all Muslims. With the month of Ramadan nearly upon the region, Kuwait’s extensive preparations of covering 1,700 mosques, safety planning, infrastructure servicing and cross-agency coordination are setting the stage for a spiritually rich and orderly observance. These efforts demonstrate how government planning and community engagement come together to support traditions that are central to cultural and religious life during the holy month.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs is finalising maintenance and service work at nearly 1,700 mosques to ensure they are fully equipped for the influx of worshippers during Ramadan.

GURGAON: A wedding video of popular Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility after visuals surfaced showing large amounts of cash and gold being presented during wedding rituals, even as the gifts were described as “daan” (donation) and not dowry.Panwar, a resident of Gurugram and originally from Indri village in Sohna, is going to get married to Dr Tithi. Wedding ceremonies held on January 30 sparked criticism.In a reel uploaded on Panwar’s Instagram account, a person is seen reading out a detailed list of items allegedly given as “daan”. The narration mentions, “Ladke ki chain saade paanch tole ki,” followed by a list that includes a 4 tola bracelet, two gold rings for engagement and marriage, jewellery for the groom’s father, uncle, brothers, mother, sister-in-law and the bride’s sister. The video further claims that a total of 21 tolas of gold and Rs 71 lakh in cash were given.The video quickly went viral, drawing sharp criticism from social media users who questioned whether influencers were normalising dowry under the guise of tradition. “Are influencers now promoting dowry?” one user asked. Another commented, “We live in a society where all of this is applauded. No wonder we’re so doomed.” Some users even questioned why no legal action had been taken if such practices were being displayed publicly.A particularly pointed comment noted that the bride is a highly educated doctor, saying it was disturbing that such practices continued even when the woman involved is professionally accomplished.Arun Panwar began his YouTube career in 2019 and is known for automobile-related content such as car reviews, mileage tests, feature breakdowns and ownership experiences.He holds a BCA degree and has built a strong digital presence, with over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and around one million followers on Instagram.A car enthusiast, Panwar owns several premium vehicles, including a Kia Seltos, Ford Endeavour, Toyota Fortuner and Mahindra Thar.The viral wedding video has once again brought the issue of dowry into focus, raising questions about the role of social media influencers and whether rebranding such exchanges as “gifts” or “donations” can obscure practices that are legally prohibited and socially contested.","Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility.

Gallery with café? Artist Daniel Arsham opens new art-driven coffee and dessert restaurant in Dubai Mall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gallery-with-caf-artist-daniel-arsham-opens-new-art-driven-coffee-and-dessert-restaurant-in-dubai-mall/articleshow/127899993.cms,"Daniel's Room Dubai Mall: Art, Coffee and Desserts Fusion in Fashion Avenue

What is Daniel’s Room? More than a café in Dubai Mall



Strategic location of Daniel Arsham's cafe and its cultural relevance







Dubai’s culinary and cultural landscape just got a bold new addition with the launch of Daniel’s Room at Dubai Mall’s Fashion Avenue, a space where specialty coffee, limited-edition desserts and contemporary art coexist under one roof. The concept, created by artist Daniel Arsham, has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about openings in the city’s dynamic food and lifestyle scene.Unlike traditional restaurants or dessert spots, Daniel’s Room is designed as an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element, from the furniture and lighting to tableware and pastries, reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham, the contemporary artist behind the space. Arsham’s work, known for its exploration of time, erosion and imagined futures, has been integrated into the design of the café itself.The interiors merge sculptural forms and tactile materials to create a setting that feels more like a gallery or architectural installation than a conventional restaurant. This artistic philosophy extends to the menu, which features specialty coffee, pastries, cakes and light bites that have been developed and tested over months to match the same thoughtful, tactile ethos as the space’s design.Part of what makes Daniel’s Room stand out is its hybrid identity of being simultaneously a café, a cultural destination and an art installation. The space includes limited-edition books, collectible objects and custom-designed tableware created exclusively for the venue, not available in galleries or online elsewhere.Unlike typical retail in a shopping mall setting, these collectibles are integrated into the café experience rather than dominating it and encourage visitors to sit, explore the details and return for both the ambience and the edible offerings. Daniel’s Room has been described as a place to “live in, not just visit,” where patrons are encouraged to settle in, enjoy their coffee, peruse art books and absorb the carefully curated aesthetic.Located on Level 2 of Fashion Avenue in one of the world’s busiest retail destinations, Daniel’s Room benefits from high footfall while offering visitors a unique cultural and culinary break from mainstream dining spots in Dubai Mall. Dubai has long become a global hub for innovative culinary concepts and experiential dining, from themed fine-dining restaurants to cafés that elevate coffee culture to an art form and Daniel’s Room fits squarely into this trend, offering something that is both visually compelling and gastronomically satisfying.Daniel’s Room reflects a broader cultural shift where art, lifestyle and daily experiences converge. Rather than confining art to museums or galleries, this concept brings artistic ingenuity into everyday rituals like having a cup of coffee or enjoying a dessert. This approach is not entirely new as iconic creative figures like Gordon Matta-Clark and Damien Hirst have explored restaurant concepts tied to their artistic vision but Daniel’s Room positions this tradition within a contemporary, globally recognised retail and lifestyle context.By integrating sculptural design with carefully considered food and beverage offerings, the space becomes a destination for both locals and tourists seeking more than just a meal; they are seeking an experience that stimulates multiple senses. Daniel’s Room is more than a new café, it represents a blurring of boundaries between food, art and design.By transforming a routine coffee stop into an immersive cultural experience, Daniel Arsham’s latest venture contributes to Dubai’s reputation as a global city where creativity, luxury and everyday life intersect. Whether you are there for the specialty coffee, limited-edition collectibles or simply to soak in the art-infused space, Daniel’s Room offers a fresh way to experience Dubai Mall, not just as a retail hub but as a destination for cultural discovery.","Daniel’s Room is an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham.

Dubai set to adopt China’s ‘Sponge City’ model — What the future city could look like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-set-to-adopt-chinas-sponge-city-model-what-the-future-city-could-look-like/articleshow/127900886.cms,"Inside the Sponge City Vision Set to Reshape Urban Life / Image: AI

What is China’s Sponge City?



What Sponge City could offer in Dubai?

Roads and pavements designed to absorb water instead of repelling it

Parks, plazas, and landscaped areas that temporarily store rainwater during storms

Green roofs and shaded corridors that reduce heat while managing runoff

Underground water storage systems beneath urban zones for reuse in irrigation

Smart, AI-driven monitoring systems to predict rainfall and manage drainage loads

Dubai–Shenzhen Partnership

Commute for all







In a major move toward climate resilience, Dubai has officially embraced the ""Sponge City"" urban model through a landmark partnership with the Chinese tech hub, Shenzhen. Announced during the World Governments Summit (WGS) 2026, this collaboration aims to transform how the emirate handles heavy rainfall.A ""Sponge City"" is designed to act just like its name suggests, rather than letting water pool on asphalt or overwhelm traditional sewers, the city uses permeable pavements, rooftop gardens, and specialized wetlands to absorb, store, and purify rainwater. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shenzhen, a world leader in this field, Dubai is bringing in decades of expertise to ensure its streets remain dry and functional even during the most intense desert storms.China introduced sponge cities to tackle flooding, water scarcity, and urban overheating caused by rapid concrete-heavy development. In Shenzhen, the model combines permeable roads, green roofs, rain gardens, wetlands, underground reservoirs, and smart drainage systems into a single, integrated urban ecosystem.Rather than relying solely on pipes and pumps, sponge cities use nature-based solutions supported by technology.Water is absorbed where it falls, stored temporarily during heavy rain, filtered naturally, and reused for irrigation or cooling.Dubai officials see this as a practical model to adapt, especially as climate patterns shift and short bursts of heavy rainfall become more frequent across the region.This initiative is a critical pillar of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, which focuses on enhancing the quality of life and doubling the city’s green areas. The partnership with Shenzhen will see the development of ""Rain Gardens"" and ""Bio-Swell"" zones, beautifully landscaped areas that double as natural drainage systems.City planners envision:His Excellency Dawoud Al Hajri, Director General of Dubai Municipality, emphasized that this isn't just about disaster prevention; it’s about urban aesthetics. By integrating nature into the drainage strategy, Dubai will see more parks and tree-lined streets that naturally cool the city while managing water.The agreement between Dubai Municipality and UPDIS sets out cooperation in urban planning, sponge city development, smart technologies, low-carbon growth, and future-ready city design.Dubai Municipality Director General Eng. Marwan Ahmed bin Ghalita said the partnership reflects Dubai’s strategy of learning from global leaders while developing cities that are sustainable, resilient, and people-centric. Shenzhen’s UPDIS President Yu Lu noted that both cities share similarities, young, fast-growing, and innovation-driven, making collaboration especially effective.The partnership includes research exchange, technical cooperation, and annual progress reviews, ensuring the sponge city concept is adapted carefully to Dubai’s environment and long-term plans.For the average resident, ""Sponge City"" technology means no more waterlogged roads, reduced traffic delays during the rainy season, and a significant boost in local greenery. By utilizing the Shenzhen model, Dubai is positioning itself as a global leader in desert urbanism.As H.E. Abdulla Al Basti, Secretary General of the Dubai Executive Council, noted, this partnership reflects the city’s commitment to ""proactive governance"", solving future problems today through global cooperation and high-tech engineering.","Dubai has officially embraced the ""Sponge City"" urban model through a landmark partnership with the Chinese tech hub, Shenzhen.

In a stunning display that married adrenaline with architectural spectacle, five elite wingsuit athletes from XDubai recently executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina, which is now officially recognised as the world’s tallest hotel. The aerial stunt, part of the hotel’s grand opening celebrations, saw the team fly at speeds topping 200 km/h, including a jaw-dropping pass through a narrow architectural opening nicknamed the “eye of the needle.”This event did not just shatter expectations for extreme sports in the UAE, it spotlighted Dubai’s evolving strategy to fuse tourism, bold design and sky-high experiences into its global brand identity.At the heart of this spectacle is Ciel Dubai Marina, a landmark skyscraper rising to 377 metres, with 82 floors and 1,004 rooms and suites, now proudly holding the title of the world’s tallest hotel. The hotel’s dramatic architecture, complete with a glass-clad “Eye of the Needle” feature in its structure, served as the stage for the wingsuit team’s high-stakes flight.This distinctive design element, more typically admired from the ground, turned into a literal flight path for the athletes and a symbolic and literal integration of extreme sport with structural ingenuity.Ciel Dubai Marina’s opening and the choice of a wingsuit airshow reflects Dubai’s push to redefine mainstream hospitality by blending experience-driven tourism with record-breaking architecture.Wingsuit flying is one of the most technically demanding branches of sky sports, requiring intense control, aerodynamic precision and split-second decision-making. In this stunt, the lead flyer sliced through the tower’s narrow opening, an achievement that the team and onlookers dubbed the “eye of the needle” manoeuvre, at blistering speeds of over 200 km/h.The rest of the team maintained a tight formation around the hotel, their movements accentuated by coloured smoke trails that painted the sky above Dubai Marina. A custom FPV (first-person view) drone followed the team through their flight path, capturing cinematic footage from angles that no ground camera could match.Such stunts demand not only peak physical skill but also meticulous planning and coordination with team members rehearsing jumps and formations dozens of times to ensure safety and precision in execution.The wingsuit demonstration was more than a stunt; it acted as a global spectacle aligned with Dubai’s larger tourism ambitions. Dubai has consistently sought to intertwine extreme experiences with its luxurious hospitality offerings, from world-record attractions to architectural marvels. The combination of Ciel Dubai Marina’s grand opening and the wingsuit flight drew attention not just from local observers but from aviation, tourism and adventure enthusiasts worldwide.This aerial show also aligns with a rising trend of place-branding through experiential events, where cities leverage extraordinary activations (like skydives, wingsuit flights and other high-adrenaline displays) to signal innovation, modernity and fearless ambition to global audiences. Dubai’s use of extreme sports as part of its tourism and identity playbook is well-established. Organisations like XDubai have been behind several high-visibility events that combine thrill with destination marketing, including BASE jumps, wing suits and other aerial feats that often involve the city’s tallest structures or unique landscapes.The Ciel Dubai Marina flight expands this strategy into a new chapter, one where luxury hospitality openings are given experience-driven spectacles that both celebrate architectural achievement and propel media coverage worldwide. For the global tourism industry, such demonstrations serve a dual purpose: they position destinations as adventure-ready and forward-thinking and they create social media moments that amplify reach far beyond traditional travel marketing campaigns.The flight underscores several broader trends of blending extreme sports with destination launches, creating high-visibility spectacles rather than static ribbon-cuttings, architectural landmarks as arenas for experience-based storytelling where buildings become stages for memorable moments and Dubai’s strategic tourism diversification by combining luxury hospitality, adventure experiences and record-breaking design into its global brand.As cities around the world compete for attention in a crowded tourism landscape, activities like the XDubai wingsuit flight around Ciel Dubai Marina demonstrate how bold experiences can become powerful currency in the attention economy, attracting global eyes to local innovation. The recent wingsuit flight around and through Ciel Dubai Marina was more than a daring aerial stunt, it was a statement about Dubai’s evolving identity as a hub of experiential tourism and architectural excellence.By marrying extreme sports with the debut of the world’s tallest hotel, the event elevated a hospitality opening into a global conversation about taste, risk and spectacle. In doing so, it offered a compelling peek into how destinations of tomorrow might choose to tell their stories, not just with buildings but with bold, unforgettable moments in the sky.","Five elite XDubai wingsuit pros executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

A Southern Chinese man extracts 191 grams of gold from scrapping SIM cards



Who is the man behind the process







On January 20 2026, a southern Chinese man's video surfaced online, who reportedly managed to extract 191 grams of gold from discarded SIMs. This triggered a further surge in demand for used SIM cards. The Chinese man commonly referred to as “Qiao” from Huizhou, Guangdong province, specialising in refining previous scrap metal, was reportedly behind the process.The extracted gold after filtering and heating reveals the worth, which is around 200,000 Yuan or approximately 27 lakhs. According to the South China Morning Post, this extraction may seem like a small DIY project, but it is far more complex than it seems in reality.The video went viral when Qiao poured stacks of used SIM cards into barrels of heat and corrosion. The scrap SIM card prices have reportedly shot up, and vendors are selling faster than they can stock. Some buyers say they want to mimic Qiao’s method.There’s fascination with the idea that you could pull gold from what looks like junk. But as Qiao warns, amateurs might be hurt, but one misstep could lead to chemical burns or worse.The modern SIM card typically contains less than 0.001 gram of gold, which means you would need approximately 400,000 cards to replicate Qiao’s recent results. What seems simple involves a complex process for extraction, which is termed Aqua Regia, that is, highly corrosive water. Experts warn: one mistake could lead to the release of lethal explosive gases.Qiao comes from Huizhou in Guangdong province. He’s a scrap metal refiner by trade. People online have dubbed him the “alchemist.” He reportedly told local media that the gold didn’t just come from SIM cards but with other discarded electronic chips helped make the total 191 grams.As reported, experts say it’s illegal in some regions to handle such chemicals without proper permits and is also dangerous. Qiao’s gold extraction might look like fun but it’s not a DIY hobby.","A Southern Chinese man extracts 191 grams of gold from scrapped SIM cards.

You can read Epstein’s emails like you are inside his inbox,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-can-read-epsteins-emails-like-you-are-inside-his-inbox/articleshow/127866090.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein’s CHILLING ‘Confession’ In UNSEEN Interview With Steve Bannon | ‘Am I The Devil?’

Who built Jmail and what they were trying to prove

How the inbox changes the reading experience





Sifting through large document dumps is usually a tedious exercise, even when the material is of major public interest. That has been the case with emails linked to Jeffrey Epstein, which have circulated in the public domain as scanned PDFs, plain text files, and images released through court cases and official disclosures. A recent web project changes that experience entirely. Instead of forcing readers to jump between files, it presents the emails inside a familiar, Gmail-style interface, making the archive feel like a real inbox and turning a messy collection of documents into something far easier to explore, search, and understand.The project, known as Jmail, recreates the look and behaviour of Google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public. There is no new data and no private access involved. The aim is usability rather than revelation: to make existing records readable without specialist tools or hours of manual sorting.Jmail was created by Riley Walz, described by Wired as a prankster and internet artist, working alongside web developer Luke Igel. Rather than treating the Epstein emails as raw evidence to be mined for new revelations, the pair approached them as both a technical challenge and a cultural problem.Their central question was not what the emails contained, but how the way information is presented shapes who engages with it and who does not.The creators have framed Jmail as an experiment in accessibility. Public records, they argue, are often technically available but practically unusable, buried in fragmented files that discourage close reading. By rebuilding the archive in a familiar format, they sought to expose the gap between transparency in principle and transparency in practice.The interface mirrors the conventions of a standard email client. Messages are clearly divided between sent and received folders, conversations are grouped into threads, and a search bar allows users to look up names, dates, and keywords instantly. These small design decisions dramatically alter how the material can be navigated. Instead of skimming isolated documents, users can follow patterns of correspondence and timelines with minimal friction.For journalists and researchers, this reduces the time spent on basic organisation and increases the time available for analysis. For general readers, the familiar layout removes the intimidation factor that often accompanies large document dumps, making engagement more likely.Although the presentation can feel provocative, Jmail functions primarily as a research aid rather than a stunt. It does not introduce new information or private data, nor does it claim to reveal hidden material. Its significance lies in how it demonstrates that interface design can influence whether public records are ignored, misunderstood, or meaningfully examined.","The project, known as Jmail, recreates the look and behaviour of Google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public.

Dubai authorities reveal two key locations for the futuristic Dubai Loop,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-authorities-reveal-two-key-locations-for-the-futuristic-dubai-loop/articleshow/127884538.cms,"Dubai launches the first phase of its futuristic Loop transport system / Image: AI

What is the Dubai Loop?

Key Locations

Faster, smoother travel beneath busy city streets

Integration with existing networks like Dubai Metro and buses

Reduced surface traffic congestion

Enhanced commuter experience with climate-controlled stations and modern vehicles

Alternate ""Active"" loop

What’s next?





Dubai is officially taking its ""transport of tomorrow"" beneath the surface. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Elon Musk ’s The Boring Company, has identified the initial corridor for the revolutionary Dubai Loop.The first phase of this underground network will specifically target two of the most congested yet vital areas in the emirate. While the full 17km pilot phase will feature 11 stations, the ""anchor"" locations are set to connect Downtown Dubai and the Dubai Marina area.This strategic link aims to bridge the city's commercial core with its most popular residential and tourist seafront, effectively creating a ""wormhole"" that bypasses the daily gridlock of Sheikh Zayed Road.The Dubai Loop is an underground high-speed transport system developed in collaboration with The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunnel-building venture, and aims to dramatically cut travel times, ease congestion, and redefine urban mobility in Dubai. Officials say the system could evolve into a network capable of carrying 20,000 passengers per hour or more via high-speed electric vehicles moving through dedicated tunnels.Originally announced in 2025, the plan envisages an extensive network that spans several kilometres beneath the city’s busiest areas. The Loop will feature multiple underground stations integrated with existing transit systems, offering commuters fast, weather-protected travel while reducing traffic on surface roads.According to The Boring Company’s project overview, the initial network could eventually expand beyond its first phase to serve many more destinations, making it a cornerstone of Dubai’s long-term transportation transformation.RTA has indicated that construction will begin soon on the first phase, covering the section between Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Dubai Mall. These areas were chosen for early rollout because they are among Dubai’s most frequently travelled corridors, linking business districts with major retail, leisure and metro hubs.This section is expected to serve as a proof of concept for the larger network, allowing engineers and planners to refine operations, passenger handling and safety systems before extending the Loop to other high-traffic areas of the city.Once operational, the Loop is expected to offer:In parallel with the underground tunnels, a second ""Loop"" project led by Emirati firm URB is set to transform the city's surface. Known as THE LOOP, this is a 93km climate-controlled cycling and walking highway.This glass-enclosed structure will encircle the city, connecting over 3 million residents to key locations within a 20-minute walk or bike ride. Powered by kinetic flooring that generates electricity from your footsteps, this project aligns with the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan to make the city the most walkable and bike-friendly in the world.RTA officials, including Matar Al Tayer, have emphasised that the Dubai Loop’s first phase of work will begin imminently, though official operational dates are yet to be confirmed. Industry observers expect that initial segments could start test runs as early as 2026, with continued expansion in the years that follow.As the Loop takes shape, residents and commuters will get their first glimpse of how underground mass transit could complement Dubai’s world-class public transport system, from its iconic Metro to autonomous vehicles and high-speed rail.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has identified the initial corridor for the revolutionary Dubai Loop.

Across the seven Emirates, the call to prayer provides a moment of reflection amidst the country's fast-paced lifestyle. For Tuesday, February 3, 2026, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (AWQAF) has released the official timings.In the capital, Abu Dhabi, the day began with the Fajr prayer at 5:41 AM, while in Dubai, the Adhan was called slightly earlier at 5:37 AM. As the sun reaches its peak, Dhuhr provides a mid-day pause for workers and residents alike. Following these precise timings ensures that the community remains connected through shared discipline and devotion.In the UAE, the moments following the prayer are cherished for ""Dhikr"" (remembrance). The IACAD (Islamic Affairs & Charitable Activities Department) encourages worshippers to utilize the quiet time after the final Tasleem for personal supplication.One of the most powerful practices involves reciting ""Ayat al-Kursi,"" which is believed to offer divine protection. Many residents also follow the Sunnah of reciting ""SubhanAllah"" (33 times), ""Alhamdulillah"" (33 times), and ""Allahu Akbar"" (33 times).These small acts of mindfulness help maintain spiritual clarity during a busy workday, acting as a mental and emotional reset.The UAE is already preparing for the most blessed month of the year. Based on astronomical data from the Emirates Astronomy Society, Ramadan 2026 is expected to begin on or around February 18, 2026. This year, Ramadan falls during the ""cool"" season, offering pleasant weather for those fasting. As the month progresses, the fasting hours will shift slightly.Authorities continue to advise worshippers to rely on official mosque announcements, Awqaf schedules, and trusted prayer calendars, as prayer times shift gradually each day due to seasonal changes.Mosques across the UAE broadcast the Azan in line with these approved timings, ensuring consistency for congregational prayers throughout the country.","For Tuesday, February 3, 2026, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (AWQAF) has released the official timings.

Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient but breaking the rules can cost commuters from Dh100 to a hefty Dh2,000. As the city’s public transport usage surges, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has reinforced a comprehensive list of penalties aimed at ensuring safety, cleanliness and smooth operations across stations and trains.From fare evasion and smoking to tampering with emergency equipment, the penalties cover everything from minor etiquette breaches to serious safety violations and they are strictly enforced.With millions of passengers using the Metro every day, Dubai’s transport authorities have increasingly focused on discipline, safety and passenger experience. Officials say the fines are designed not to punish but to encourage responsible commuting and protect public safety.According to RTA guidance, penalties range widely depending on severity, with behavioural infractions attracting smaller fines and safety-related violations attracting the maximum penalties.The most common fines come from everyday mistakes that many commuters may not realise are violations. Watch out as Dh100 fines include:These are considered etiquette or behavioural breaches but can still add up if repeated frequently.More serious violations relate to fare evasion, cleanliness and misuse of transport services. Watch out as Dh200 fines include:As for Dh500 fines, they include:These penalties aim to discourage fare fraud and maintain the Metro’s strict cleanliness standards.Sleeping in prohibited areas including shelters and restricted zones, carries a Dh300 fine, highlighting how even seemingly harmless actions can attract penalties.The highest fines are reserved for actions that could endanger passengers or disrupt operations. Watch out as Dh1,000 fines include:Meanwhile, Dh2,000 fines include:These violations are treated seriously due to the potential risk to lives and infrastructure.Metro users driving to stations also face penalties. Vehicles parked beyond permitted times at Metro car parks can attract Dh100 per day fines, capped at Dh1,000. Transport experts say strict penalties are part of Dubai’s strategy to maintain global-standard public transport systems.The city aims to keep its Metro safe, hygienic and efficient, especially as ridership grows due to tourism, population expansion and sustainability initiatives. RTA officials stress that compliance with signage and inspector instructions is crucial to preventing overcrowding, accidents and disruptions.Dubai’s Metro is central to the emirate’s smart mobility and sustainability goals, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Ensuring passengers follow rules helps keep the system reliable, a key factor as Dubai prepares for major expansions like new lines and rising commuter volumes.Commuter checklist:Dubai Metro fines range from Dh100 for minor etiquette breaches to Dh2,000 for serious safety violations, reflecting the city’s zero-tolerance approach to misconduct on public transport. With millions relying on the Metro daily, authorities say strict enforcement is essential to maintaining safety, efficiency and a world-class commuting experience.","Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient.

Abu Dhabi pet registration process



The Health Check: The vet will perform a medical examination to ensure the animal is healthy and up-to-date on its annual vaccinations.

The Microchip Requirement: A permanent microchip is mandatory. If your pet isn't chipped, the vet will install one, as the chip’s unique number is the primary key for the digital file.

TAMM Integration: The vet uploads the medical and microchip data directly to the government portal. Once uploaded, the owner will receive a notification to log into the TAMM app using their UAE Pass to confirm ownership and receive an official Animal Ownership Certificate.

Why does your pet need a digital ID?





Starting February 3, 2026, owning a pet in Abu Dhabi officially comes with a new set of digital responsibilities.The Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT) has launched a mandatory pet registration system designed to bring every cat and dog into a secure, centralized database.By linking every pet to an owner via the TAMM platform, authorities can now provide better protection, monitor health trends, and manage the city's animal population with precision.The government has made the process as frictionless as possible to encourage early compliance. Registration is currently free of charge for all residents.To get started, pet owners must visit a licensed veterinary clinic in Abu Dhabi.While the law officially kicks in on February 3, the government is prioritizing education over immediate punishment.Individual pet owners are being granted a generous one-year grace period to complete the registration.However, this window is much smaller for businesses; pet shops, shelters, and commercial breeders must have all their animals registered within six months.Once these grace periods expire, the ""soft approach"" ends, failure to register a pet or keep its record updated will result in a Dh1,000 fine.This shift brings immediate practical benefits to the average resident. The most significant ""Common Impact"" is the recovery of lost pets. With a unified database, a lost dog found in a park can be scanned at any clinic, and the owner’s details will pop up instantly, ending the days of frantic social media searches.Additionally, the system ensures biosecurity; as Abu Dhabi opens more pet-friendly cafes, hotels, and parks, only registered and vaccinated pets will be allowed access, protecting both public health and your furry friend’s safety.","Abu Dhabi launches mandatory pet registration system on February 3, 2026.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

Why this theory refuses to die

The unglamorous truth





Every few years, Stanley Kubrick dies again. Not in reality — in the imagination of the internet, which keeps resurrecting him as a martyr every time it rediscovers Eyes Wide Shut and decides the film was not art, not allegory, but a warning.This latest revival arrives via a viral X thread built around a familiar clip from Eyes Wide Shut: masked elites, ritualised menace, and a caption doing all the heavy lifting — They killed Stanley Kubrick. It is the kind of post that does not argue, does not explain, and does not need to. In the Epstein era, implication has replaced evidence.What the thread is really selling is not a claim about 1999. It is a mood about now. A belief that the powerful do unspeakable things behind closed doors, and that anyone who shows us the door gets removed from the building.The conspiracy begins with timing, then gets promoted to theologyKubrick died of a heart attack on March 7, 1999, aged 70, days after screening what he described as the final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for the studio. That is the factual core.Everything else is architecture built on proximity. A few days becomes too close.A heart attack becomes convenient. A final cut becomes unfinished truth. Kubrick — already mythologised as secretive, obsessive, and distrustful of studios — becomes the perfect protagonist for suspicion because he does not feel like a man who simply dies. He feels like a man who is stopped.The villain, inevitably, is Warner Bros., accused of panicking after Kubrick’s death and excising scenes that supposedly exposed elite sexual rituals, child sacrifice, and organised depravity. No scripts. No verified footage. No paper trail. Just vibes, passed around as certainty.Strip away the internet’s interpretive gymnastics and Eyes Wide Shut is something far less sensational and far more Kubrickian.It is not an exposé. It is an erotic psychological drama about class, access, jealousy, and humiliation. The masked ritual is not a documentary insert. It is allegory — Kubrick doing what he always did: using spectacle to show how power behaves when it is unaccountable.The horror does not come from what is shown, but from how it is shown: the calmness of authority, the politeness of menace, the certainty that rules exist you will never be allowed to read. Kubrick was never interested in naming villains. He was interested in systems.At its core, Eyes Wide Shut follows a wealthy New York doctor whose marriage is destabilised when his wife calmly admits she once fantasised about another man. It is not infidelity that unravels him, but the discovery that desire exists beyond his control. Shaken, he spends a night drifting through the city, pulled into a chain of sexual encounters and near-encounters — prostitutes, intermediaries, coded invitations — until he infiltrates a masked gathering in a mansion where sex, power, and hierarchy are ritualised into theatre.At each stop, the illusion of choice dissolves. He believes he is participating. He is merely tolerated. When he is identified as an outsider, the response is not violence but certainty. He is warned to forget. By morning, he returns to domestic normalcy chastened, aware that the world he briefly glimpsed is real, ordered, and utterly indifferent to him. The film is not about sex so much as humiliation — the humiliation of learning that privilege has limits, and that beyond those limits lie rooms you are not meant to enter, even if the door briefly opens.The latest surge owes much to a resurfaced podcast clip featuring Roger Avary, one of the credited co-writers on Eyes Wide Shut, speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience.Avary suggests that post-production decisions were taken after Kubrick’s death. That is unremarkable. Films are finished this way all the time. What Avary does not claim is that the studio removed scenes depicting child sacrifice, elite pedophile rings, or satanic cults. Those details are supplied later by the audience, not the speaker.Conspiracy culture thrives on ellipses. A pause becomes proof. A maybe becomes a manifesto.The Kubrick theory did not originate with Jeffrey Epstein — but Epstein transformed it.Once Epstein’s crimes became public, something broke in the collective imagination. The comforting assumption that elite abuse could not exist at scale collapsed. The idea that “they would never get away with it” stopped sounding naïve and started sounding dishonest.From that moment on, fictional depictions of elite depravity were reread as confessions. Eyes Wide Shut became prophetic. Kubrick became a whistleblower. Epstein became the missing footnote. The ritual scene became evidence. And every unanswered question became confirmation of suppression.The problem is mundane but fatal to the theory: Epstein’s crimes were real and documented. Eyes Wide Shut was adapted from a novella written in 1926. The overlap is emotional, not evidentiary.Where the conspiracy gains traction is not in facts, but in aesthetics and structure. The parallels are visual, social, and psychological — enough to feel uncanny without being causal.First, there is the geography of power. In Eyes Wide Shut, the ritual takes place in an isolated mansion, accessible only through invitation and compliance. Epstein’s world, as later revealed, operated through similarly controlled spaces: private islands, gated townhouses, aircraft with restricted passenger lists. Power, in both cases, is not loud. It is secluded.Second, there is the language of hierarchy. Kubrick’s ritual is less about sex than about rank — who wears which mask, who speaks, who is allowed to stay. Epstein’s operation functioned through comparable ladders: recruiters, intermediaries, facilitators, patrons. Proximity to power determined immunity.Third, there is the mechanism of silence. In the film, the protagonist is not threatened with death so much as erasure. He is told, calmly, that forgetting would be wise. Epstein’s influence rested on similar dynamics: legal intimidation, reputational pressure, non-disclosure, and the quiet assurance that consequences flow in only one direction.Finally, there is the illusion of choice. Kubrick’s characters believe they are acting freely until they realise the rules were written long before they arrived. Accounts from Epstein’s orbit describe a comparable trap — consent blurred by manipulation, dependency, and asymmetry.These similarities are real enough to unsettle. They are also broad enough to be universal. This is how power often looks, whether in fiction or in life.When people say “the Epstein files”, they are usually referring to a debris field rather than a single smoking gun: court filings, depositions, contact books, flight logs, schedules, emails, photographs, investigative materials, and later releases that arrive piecemeal and often out of context.Two things can be true at once. Epstein cultivated proximity to powerful people. Proximity, by itself, is not proof of participation in his crimes. The internet hates that distinction.Consider the recurring claims that “the files confirm everything”.There are unsealed court materials that name public figures, often as part of witness testimony or third-party references. Names appearing in documents are repeatedly treated as convictions rather than context. There are contact books that resemble address directories, which get rebranded online as “client lists”. There are flight logs that show who travelled with Epstein, which are then treated as proof of criminal involvement regardless of timing, purpose, or corroboration.There are also email caches and schedules that reveal something more prosaic and more unsettling: Epstein’s skill at networking. He placed himself among academics, politicians, financiers, and celebrities by offering access, money, and introductions. That social proximity looks conspiratorial when collapsed into screenshots. In reality, it often reveals opportunism rather than orchestration.And then there are the administrative failures — redactions missed, documents released and reprocessed — which fuel the idea that something vast is being hidden, when what they often demonstrate is institutional mess.This is the key problem. Partial visibility plus moral outrage produces maximum misinformation.Once Epstein is invoked, the narrative often slides into adrenochrome harvesting and satanic rites — claims with no evidentiary basis, recycled from older conspiracy traditions and given a modern aesthetic.At this point, the Kubrick myth stops pretending to be about Kubrick and becomes a delivery mechanism for something older and darker. The ritual scene becomes a Rorschach test. Those predisposed to believe in hidden cabals treat cinema as surveillance footage. Those familiar with Kubrick treat it as symbolism, nightmare logic, and class anxiety rendered as theatre.Both groups are watching the same frames. Only one insists it is journalism.The Kubrick–Epstein myth survives because it is perfectly optimised for the internet. Kubrick himself invites it. He was secretive, meticulous, and famously distrustful of studios. Eyes Wide Shut denies closure. It ends not with revelation, but with discomfort. Power remains intact, and that irritates people. And Epstein permanently altered the conspiracy landscape. After him, elite criminality no longer sounds implausible. Everything unsettling gains retroactive credibility. But plausibility is not proof. Suspicion is not scholarship.There is no credible evidence that Stanley Kubrick was assassinated. There is no verified evidence that Eyes Wide Shut originally contained scenes of child sacrifice or a literal depiction of an Epstein-style trafficking ring. There is also no need for any of that to be true for the film to feel disturbing.Kubrick’s point survives without the martyr myth. Power is opaque. Access is controlled. The elite operate by rules they do not explain to those beneath them. That is not a secret. That is sociology.The internet prefers the version where the director becomes the sacrifice, because that version flatters the audience. If Kubrick was killed for revealing “the truth”, then watching the clip makes you brave. If Kubrick was simply making art about class and desire, then watching the clip makes you a person on your phone.And that is a far less cinematic role.","Eyes Wide Shut is an erotic psychological drama about class, access, jealousy, and humiliation.

"Stanford students pretend to be Jains to escape $7,944 mandatory meal plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stanford-students-pretend-to-be-jains-to-escape-7944-mandatory-meal-plan/articleshow/127872443.cms,"How Jain identity entered the Stanford dining debate

Online reaction and wider debate





A Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan. The allegation, which has circulated widely on social media, suggests that students use religious dietary exemptions to redirect their dining funds to off-campus grocery stores such as Whole Foods, where they believe food options are fresher or better suited to their preferences. The claim is based on anecdotal observations and student conversations rather than official university records.The controversy stems from an opinion essay written by Stanford undergraduate Sebastian Connolly and published in The New York Times. Connolly described a campus culture of “optimisation,” arguing that students openly discuss ways to work around rules, including claiming Jain identity to qualify for dining exemptions. The essay did not present institutional figures or disciplinary cases, instead relying on personal observation and student conversations.Jainism has strict dietary principles that emphasise non-violence toward all living beings. Followers typically follow a strict vegetarian diet, avoiding meat, fish, eggs, and foods that involve harm to living organisms. Many Jains also avoid root vegetables such as onions, garlic, potatoes, and carrots, as harvesting them can kill the entire plant and disturb microorganisms in the soil.Because of these constraints, many universities, including Stanford, allow religious accommodations when campus dining cannot reasonably meet such requirements. Students granted exemptions may be permitted to opt out of standard meal plans and spend dining funds elsewhere.Stanford requires most undergraduates living on campus to enrol in a meal plan. The university also states that exemptions can be granted for documented religious or medical reasons. However, the institution does not publicly release data on how many students claim religious dietary exemptions, how those claims are reviewed, or whether misuse is investigated.The claim has fuelled wider debate over the cost of college meal plans, the quality of campus dining, and how accommodation systems are used. Some commentators say it reflects growing frustration among students with expensive and inflexible dining rules. Others caution that unverified allegations should not be confused with the practices of the religion itself, noting that the issue, if it exists, concerns individual behaviour rather than Jain dietary traditions.Beyond Stanford, the issue points to a wider strain across universities. Students are facing rising costs and limited flexibility, pushing some to look for any lawful way to stretch their budgets. At the same time, universities depend on trust-based systems to honour genuine religious and medical needs without turning accommodations into an exercise in policing identity.","Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

ChatGPT to balance ads with organic answers

ChatGPT ads pilot program

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot. Now, days after making the announcement the company has revealed that it is planning to build an ‘ads integrity’ team in order to make sure that its new business model does not compromise the trust of its users and prevent any kids of scams. As reported by Business Insider, a job listing posted in late January describes the role as part of a “0 → 1 team,” meaning it will be built from scratch to design systems that protect users from harmful or misleading advertising.The listing highlights that the key responsibilities of the team will be developing “know your customer” (KYC) systems to verify advertiser identities and assess risk. KYC, widely used in finance, is a labor-intensive but crucial safeguard against scam ads and fraudulent content. The issue has become pressing for tech companies with self-service ad platforms—Meta, for example, said it removed 134 million scam ads in 2025, according to a Reuters investigation.As per the report, Arilla Gracia, COO of the Check My Ads Institute, noted that while KYC is a strong foundation, the real test will be how deeply OpenAI invests in integrity beyond the launch phase. “KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,” she said.Along with this, the new team will also focus on determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT, an important decision as OpenAI seeks balance monetisation with user trust. Advertisers have also stressed that OpenAI must prove ads embedded in AI answers can deliver measurable results if the company hopes to scale its ad business.An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that a small test of ads will run soon on ChatGPT’s free tier and Go tier in the US. Advertisers must commit to a minimum spend of $200,000 to participate. The company will track clicks and impressions initially, with plans to explore more advanced measurement options as experiments progress.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot.

In today's rapidly evolving world, technology is expanding at a rate never seen before. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always see it. Search engines, smartphones, workplace software, and online shopping are just a few of the many applications where AI operates in the background. While some are thrilled about this shift, others are concerned about losing their employment or becoming less significant. A remarkable quote from Sam Altman brings clarity and hope in this scenario. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This short sentence reminds us that machines don't own the future. Instead of avoiding technology, those who are open to learning, adapting, and developing with it are its owners.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past.A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out. People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Sam Altman's quote of the day: ""AI won’t replace humans.

Microsoft has officially promoted four top sales executives to the rank of Executive Vice President, a report has said. The promotions come just months after Judson Althoff was elevated to CEO of Microsoft’s Commercial Business. These promoted leaders will continue to report directly to Althoff, serving as the frontline for Microsoft’s global commercial expansion.According to a report by CNBC, this move is designed to accelerate the company’s “commercial product strategy” amid an intensifying AI competition. By expanding their role, Althoff reportedly aims to free himself to focus on the technical integration of generative AI into the company's core software offerings.The timing of these leadership changes is critical because the company shares dipped 15% in 2026, lagging behind the rest of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants. Post results, investors expressed concern over Azure’s growth, which missed projections, and the long-term ROI of the company's massive AI investments.“This feedback loop is critical right now because AI is being adopted at extraordinary speed. Our customers expect these capabilities to come to life in their business faster than ever before,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.The four promoted leaders include:has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer (Global Enterprise) and her ascent marks her as one of the most influential voices in Microsoft’s enterprise strategy.Second iswho is 26-year veteran of the company, and is now Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer (Worldwide Sales and Solutions).has been elevated to Executive Vice President and CRO for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Channel.Finally,, a former SAP executive, becomes Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer, focusing on how AI products like Microsoft 365 Copilot are actually utilised by end-users.","Microsoft has officially promoted four top sales executives to the rank of Executive Vice President.
