Matchmaking Norms: Defying norms: Matrimonial app brings modern matchmaking to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/defying-norms-matrimonial-app-brings-modern-matchmaking-to-pakistan/articleshow/112774328.cms,"Dozens of young singles in Pakistan 's Lahore , gathered this week for an event hosted by Muzz , a UK-based matrimonial app , marking a major departure from the country's traditional norms.This in-person event, the first of its kind in the conservative Islamic nation, aimed to offer an alternative to parent-arranged marriages and challenge the stigma around dating apps.In Pakistan, parents usually arrange marriages for their children, seeking matches within their communities or extended families.The country of 240 million people often see dating apps stigmatised, with gender segregation prevalent both socially and in workplaces.Muzz's app is grounded on Islamic etiquette and restricted to Muslim users. It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging. ""That is not possible,"" he said, emphasising the importance of getting to know someone before involving families.In addition to Muzz, other events like Annie's matchmaking party in Lahore are also challenging traditional matchmaking norms .Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organiser, faced criticism online for allegedly promoting a ""hookup culture."" She defended her event, explaining that it was intended to provide a safe space for singles to meet and connect.","Muzz, a UK-based matrimonial app, hosted an in-person event in Lahore.

""I must admit I shut my eyes very firmly,"" she later said.Baillie hopes to show people in their 80s and 90s that they can continue to pursue their passions and dreams.This skydive was not her first adventure; on her 100th birthday, she drove a Ferrari around the Silverstone motor racing circuit at a speed of 210 kilometers per hour (130 miles per hour). Inspired by a friend's 85-year-old father who had skydived, Baillie was determined to do the same.For Baillie, the record is secondary to the message she wants to leave behind-- that life, with all its excitement and unpredictability, continues to offer opportunities for growth and adventure, regardless of age.Baillie's skydive also served as a fundraiser for several charities close to her heart. She received support from admirers, including a special message from the Prince of Wales , a former pilot.""I haven't got long to live and I can't do much more fundraising, so I wanted to make it a rip-roaring success"", she said.Baillie's achievement surpasses the previous record held by Verdun Hayes, who had been Britain's oldest parachutist since May 2017 at 101 years and 38 days.","Manette Baillie, 102, is the oldest person in Britain to skydive.

However, what seemed like a cosmic spectacle was actually an optical illusion .The phenomenon was caused by light refracting through the layered glass of the hospital window, producing what are known as ""virtual images."" Each pane of glass contributed to the appearance of a separate sun.Despite the scientific explanation , social media users had fun speculating about the cause of the ""seven suns."" On Weibo, one user joked, ""We’ve finally uncovered the truth about global warming,"" while another humorously suggested a ""magnetic field glitch"" had caused parallel universes to overlap, but reassured viewers that ""the Cosmic Bureau has fixed the issue.""The optical illusion also garnered attention on Reddit, where users drew comparisons to the Chinese myth of Hou Yi, a cosmic archer who shot down nine of Earth’s 10 suns to prevent the planet from burning up. One Redditor quipped, ""When Earth has astigmatism,"" while another humorously questioned if the sight was a ""system apocalypse"" or a consequence of China's well-known air pollution issues.Ultimately, the ""seven suns"" were a reminder of how easily our senses can be deceived by natural phenomena, sparking a mix of awe, humor, and curiosity among those who witnessed or heard about the event.","A woman in Chengdu, China, captured a video showing seven suns in the sky.

British Colombia: British Colombia to lift campfire ban for coast and southeast soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/british-colombia-to-lift-campfire-ban-for-coast-and-southeast-soon/articleshow/112822822.cms,"Why are the fires banned?

What happens if someone lit a fire in a prohibited area?

Campfire ban for British Colombia ’s coast and southeast would soon be lifted by officials, due to prolonged wetter and cooler weather conditions in the region, reported Global News.People living in these regions will now be able to light fires limited to Category 1, once the ban is lifted. Category 1 fire is limited to half a metre wide or high. Any fire bigger than this range is considered a Category 2 and Category 3 fire and they would remain banned.The use of objects like fireworks and sky lanterns would also continue to be forbidden.The ban for the Coastal Fire Centre will be lifted at noon on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the ban on burning for the Southeast Fire Centre was removed at noon on Monday.This action follows the lifting of a prohibition on campfires in the Cariboo region by officials last Friday. Campfires are also allowed in the Prince George's Fire Centre now.However, the campfires continue to be prohibited in the Kamloops Fire Centre and the majority of the Northwest Fire Centre.According to the government, The regional fire centres decide when and where to put a fire ban into effect based on local fire hazards, expected weather conditions, and the level of fire activity in the area.Fire bans may also be put in place in anticipation of a rise in lightning-caused fires or during critical fire situations when the British Colombia Wildfire Service cannot risk having human-caused fires divert resources from naturally caused ones.In such cases, fires pose an unacceptable risk and detract from the ability to detect and respond to fires by increasing the number of false alarm smoke chases, wildfire phone reports, and nuisance fires.Violating a fire prohibition can result in a fine of up to $1,150. If the fire gets out of control and causes a wildfire, one could face a fine ranging from $100,000 to $1 million and a prison sentence of up to one year.","The ban for the Coastal Fire Centre will be lifted at noon on Wednesday.

Tom Waddington , travelling from Newfoundland to England, found himself surrounded by long-finned pilot whales on July 7, shortly after a morning drizzle.Waddington shared his experience on Instagram , expressing both wonder and concern.“This is so cool. A pod of whales is circling the boat and playing around it. I love it, but I’m worried they might hit my rudder. They’re so close, see?”He was able to hear them. Describing the experience, he said, “I can hear them blowing bubbles. Wow, that is so cool. What a special treat. I’ve seen many whales before, but they’re just here to say hello.”The situation took a worrying turn when one of the whales bumped into his boat, causing Waddington to drop his camera and briefly stop filming.Resuming the video, his tone reflected growing apprehension. “I’m two hours in now with these thousands of whales. One bumped the boat earlier, and I’m really scared they might hit it again. It’s an incredible sight, but also very frightening.”Waddington’s journey was monitored by a crew from shore, who later informed him that the whales eventually swam away, allowing him to continue paddling towards land.Though Waddington emerged unscathed, the experience underscored the challenges and realities of sharing the ocean with large marine creatures. He later recounted this encounter on social media, highlighting the shift from a serene wildlife moment to a more daunting reality.Experts believe the whales Waddington encountered were likely long-finned pilot whales, distinguished by their social nature and tendency to travel in large groups. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, these whales commonly form tight-knit pods and inhabit the North Atlantic .","Tom Waddington found himself surrounded by long-finned pilot whales on July 7, shortly after a morning drizzle.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

I want to clarify that this was not a marketing stunt or a planned promotion.”“During one of our gatherings at Starbucks , I was browsing for a new Windows laptop on Amazon and Flipkart. I stumbled upon a model on Flipkart that fit my budget and requirements, and I noticed a new feature offering delivery within 15 minutes.
