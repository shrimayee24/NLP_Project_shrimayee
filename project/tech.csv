Appearing on Pardon My Take, the former coach called out Thursday Night Football (TNF) for its brutal physical demands on players. ‚ÄúFootball is a violent game,‚Äù Gruden stated. ‚ÄúThis is not Major League Baseball, where we can play a doubleheader and go out and play here.

Indian family‚Äôs behavior on Finland train sparks clash over cultural norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/indian-familys-behavior-on-finland-train-sparks-clash-over-cultural-norms/articleshow/116637434.cms,"Indians' lack of civic sense abroad is a recurring concern, highlighted recently by an Indian tourist in Finland who shared his frustration over a loud family disrupting the peace on a quiet train. His story sparked widespread agreement online, with many recounting similar incidents and emphasising the need for greater awareness.

I'm on a train from Lapland to Helsinki and there's one family in the otherwise ULTRA QUIET carriage that's being very loud, talking to someone over a video call. In Hindi. With their cabin doors open.



We REALLY don't get civic sense, do we? ‚Äî Gokul ‚ö°Ô∏è (@gokulns) December 23, 2024

Traveling to foreign countries often reveals stark cultural differences; behaviors considered normal in one place can appear unconventional or even inappropriate in another. This was the case on a Finland train when an NRI got annoyed by a ‚Äòloud‚Äô Indian family on an otherwise quiet train.A user, Gokul Sridhar(@gokul), shared a tweet about his experience in a train compartment which he shared with people including an Indian family. Gokul described the carriage as ""extremely quiet"" until the family began speaking loudly in Hindi and leaving their cabin doors open. He expressed his frustration, remarking that Indians often lack "" civic sense .""He posted, ‚ÄúI'm on a train from Lapland to Helsinki and there's one family in the otherwise ULTRA QUIET carriage that's being very loud, talking to someone over a video call. In Hindi. With their cabin doors open. We REALLY don't get civic sense, do we?‚Äù He further added that ironically this incident happened right when he was watching a video that explained that talking loudly in trains is frowned upon in Japan as it is considered bad manners.If Sridhar thought that he had to bear the family only for the duration of the train, he was wrong. He updated in the comment section of his post that he somehow ended up in the same restaurant as the family who were again talking to someone loudly and that too without headphones. An X user advised Sridhar, ‚ÄúEasier to stop by and request them to close the door and lower their voice?‚Äù To which he retorts, ‚ÄúYup I'm gonna do that but there shouldn't even be a need for this, is my point.‚ÄùThe post has since received more than 12k views and the comment section has divided reaction to this. A user sharing his own experience said, ‚ÄúSame in Manc. I'm on a train to London on the quiet coach trying to get some sleep. Guess who's talking on their phone loudly in the QUIET COACH‚ÄùHowever, some sympathetic users asked Sridhar to tell them instead of complaining about them on social media. One user said, ‚ÄúAnd you chose to post on X rather than educating them to be quiet. Might be their first time on foreign land and out of excitement.. as a concerned Indian you must have told them the etiquettes politely.. posting on X will not improve the situation.‚ÄùThe incident reignited discussions about public behavior and cultural differences , as it highlighted the challenges of navigating diverse social norms in shared spaces. Some argue that cultural awareness and sensitivity are essential to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, especially in multicultural environments. The clash on the Finland train serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting local customs and behaviors, while also fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and tolerance. This incident underscores the need for travelers to be mindful of their actions and consider how they may be perceived by others in different cultural contexts, promoting harmony and understanding.","An Indian tourist in Finland shared his frustration over a loud family disrupting the peace on a quiet train.

Authorities consider DNA and facial reconstruction to identify woman burned to death in NYC subway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/authorities-consider-dna-and-facial-reconstruction-to-identify-woman-burned-to-death-in-nyc-subway/articleshow/116726316.cms,"Authorities are still trying to identify a woman who was horrifically burned beyond recognition in a subway attack earlier this week. Investigators are considering facial reconstruction techniques and DNA analysis as potential methods to solve the case, sources told The New York PostThe woman, who was reportedly asleep when set alight, suffered catastrophic burns that affected every layer of her skin and deeper structures, including potential thermal damage to her respiratory tract.The severity of the injuries has led authorities to explore a range of options, including the use of anthropological facial reconstruction. This method, which helps create an approximation of a person‚Äôs face from the shape of their bones, is often used when DNA or other traditional identification methods fail.Nathan Lents, a biology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, explained that facial reconstruction is typically employed when a case has gone cold.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when you‚Äôre getting into what we call the ‚Äòdragnet‚Äô stage ‚Äî when the case is kind of getting cold and there‚Äôs not a lot of leads,‚Äù he saidHe further elaborated that facial recognition or approximation comes in when all kinds of databases lead to a dead end, ‚Äúnothing‚Äôs showing up database, days and weeks have gone by and you want to call in the public to say, ‚ÄòDoes anybody know who this person is?'‚ÄùInvestigators have been focused on DNA extraction, a challenging task given the severity of the burns.‚ÄúGetting DNA from a badly burned body can be challenging, but a lot of times ‚Äòbadly burned‚Äô just means badly on the outside and beyond visual recognition.‚ÄùHowever, Lents suggested that even with extensive damage, DNA can often still be recovered from bones or internal soft tissue that may not have been affected by the fire. He noted that bones like the pelvis, shoulder blade, and femur are particularly rich in DNA, which could provide crucial evidence for identifying the victim.‚ÄúThere may be plenty of bones and internal soft tissue that is accessible for DNA extraction, unless the body has been completely incinerated, as in a cremation,‚Äù Lents told The Post.Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez confirmed that authorities have made progress in extracting DNA but are not yet in a position to identify the woman.‚ÄúThe body was badly burned, and so advanced fingerprinting efforts are being made, as well as advanced DNA evidence to identify her. We have made some progress in that area, but I‚Äôm not at liberty to get into specifics now,‚Äù Gonzalez said at a press conference.The authorities have yet to disclose specifics on the DNA findings, but experts suggest the next step will likely involve comparing the recovered DNA with databases of missing persons and previous criminal records. However, Lents pointed out that the odds of finding a match remain slim, as most people are not included in such databases.The case is further complicated by the victim‚Äôs status, as she has only been described as homeless. Authorities have yet to release any further details on her identity, and no family members have come forward to help with the identification.The woman‚Äôs suspected attacker, 34-year-old Guatemalan migrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, has been arrested and charged with the brutal crime.Facial reconstruction and genetic genealogy using databases such as 23andMe to trace the victim‚Äôs family history are both on the table, but are lengthy and may not yield immediate results. Facial reconstruction, while sometimes successful, has been known to offer only approximate likenesses and doesn‚Äôt always lead to positive identification.As investigators continue their search for answers, the case remains one of both profound tragedy and complex forensic challenges.","Authorities are still trying to identify a woman who was horrifically burned beyond recognition in a subway attack earlier this week.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham‚Äôs temperature as ‚Äúbalmy,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúThe corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.‚ÄùGuests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as ‚Äúso compact.‚ÄùIn Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a ‚Äúpeaceful and happy new life.‚Äù Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like a big family like I always wanted,‚Äù she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‚ÄòNo boisterous behavior‚Äô

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions ‚Äúclaustrophobic.‚ÄùSpeaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. ‚ÄúDiana hated Sandringham,‚Äù Seward said. ‚ÄúEven when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶ I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn‚Äôt want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they‚Äôre not rules. They‚Äôre just traditions of royalty.‚Äù Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana‚Äôs experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.‚ÄúIt was highly fraught,‚Äù Diana told Morton. ‚ÄúI know I gave, but I can‚Äôt remember being a receiver. Isn‚Äôt that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.‚Äù Diana added, ‚ÄúI sure was [an outsider].‚ÄùSeward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana‚Äôs disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. ‚ÄúShe just couldn‚Äôt understand [it],‚Äù Seward said. ‚ÄúTo her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.‚ÄùDespite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana ‚Äúhated going to Sandringham for Christmas,‚Äù mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen‚Äôs Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a ‚Äúcommand performance.‚Äù An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana‚Äôs experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana‚Äôs gift-giving experience was ‚Äúembarrassing and painful,‚Äù as she wasn‚Äôt aware of the family‚Äôs gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange ‚Äúsilly joke presents,‚Äù with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles‚Äô favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

Games are a kind of untrue truth, says Kelly Clancy in Playing With Reality: How Games Have Shaped Our World. The book‚Äôs about how human intelligence, morality, trade and military strategy have been bound up with gameplay.Play is an instinct, but games teach us social norms and morality. Moksha Patam (Snakes and Ladders) was designed to teach players about karma and the precarity of fate. Backgammon held cosmic significance in Persia, Buddhist monks saw the board game Go as a kind of moral meditation, senet taught Egyptians about the afterlife.When we play a game, we enter into its order. You can‚Äôt be a pacifist while playing Call of Duty, you have to play Monopoly like a ruthless capitalist. Games of chance are latent in our neurobiology, we explore and enjoy uncertainty.Many human societies have used games as a peaceful proxy for war. Following chaturanga and chess, based on warring military formations, the late 18th century game of Kriegsspiel became the basis of all European war simulations. It was critical to world wars, and continues to be used by modern militaries. US military has a dedicated esports unit; video games like America‚Äôs Army were used to recruit and train soldiers; Hezbollah released its own game in response.Play is a tool the brain uses to generate data on which to train itself and games represent a model of how our brain works. But they are ultimately mathematical objects. The orderly randomness of dice is no substitute for the untamed randomness of the world. Real people are not the passive objects of physics, and cannot be understood through models. Much of the book dwells on this distinction, as models and game theory have increasingly pervaded our world.SimCity, the popular computer game, inspired a generation of urban designers, skewing civic ideas. The hyper-libertarian health policy game SimHealth involved spending finite political currency, pitting Liberty against Equality or Community against Efficiency, and so on, as though these values were necessarily opposed. Assumptions are everything, and they can seep in insidiously through play.Gamification is a wonderful idea in principle: by leveraging our natural play instincts, we improve our lives. In practice, corporate thought has hijacked it, to extract money and attention, to addict players with ‚Äòdark design‚Äô practices. Gaming communities have been mobilised into troll armies in US, China uses gamification techniques to control citizens through rewards and punishments. Video games are a great learning technology but also tools of tailored surveillance today, as we trade our autonomy for entertainment.Much of the book focuses on game theory, its wide applications today, as we search for universal solutions through abstract maths. It has allowed amazing feats in biology and genetics, bringing predictive capacities into complex life-science.But games are also dangerous fiction. Their rules and rewards can replace people‚Äôs actual preferences. Game theory promises to automate decisions, but it‚Äôs never a full account of human behaviour. For the sake of mathematical simplicity, game theorists exclude our social nature, the fact that we learn from each other and from our circumstances. It has been used to launder arbitrary ideologies, which are mistakenly held up as the objective truth. A technical rule-based system can never contend with the surprises of nature, life and human behaviour. It is technocratic folly to imagine it can.","Play is an instinct, but games teach us social norms and morality.

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform‚Äôs dream duo, the Sussexes‚Äô partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a ‚Äútedious inside look‚Äù and a ‚Äúdull indulgence.‚Äù One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù from working with Markle.

No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry‚Äôs polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: ‚ÄúThe lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.‚ÄùAccording to reports, Meghan‚Äôs cookery show is now the Sussexes‚Äô last hope at staying in Netflix‚Äôs good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, ‚ÄúHer show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.‚ÄùThe show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry‚Äôs appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan‚Äôs homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard .

Marketing expert Tony Case didn‚Äôt mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, ‚ÄúHarry and Meghan are box office poison.

ChatGPT , the widely popular AI chatbot developed by OpenAI , went offline in US, leaving millions of users stranded‚Äîand sparking a wave of humor across social media.The outage began around 1:30 pm EST, according to Downdetector, with over 50,000 users reporting issues.

OpenAI confirmed the outage at 4:05 pm, blaming an unnamed internet service provider and promising to work on a fix.This marks the second outage for ChatGPT this month, following a six-hour blackout just two weeks ago. In June, the AI assistant also suffered technical difficulties that disrupted users for hours.Users on X (formerly Twitter) couldn‚Äôt resist poking fun at the situation.

Some users expressed frustration, while others simply switched platforms to vent their jokes.""All i want are some practice tests,"" another user wrote, as others referenced previous occasions on which ChatGPT was down. In one, an angry commenter stated that it took four hours for the bot to get back up and running, complaining that, in the amount of time it would take OpenAI to fix the current issues, they would simply be doodling.Despite the hiccup, ChatGPT remains the most popular AI chatbot, with over 300 million weekly users and more than a billion messages exchanged daily, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The platform is valued at a staggering $157 billion following its $6.6 billion funding round in October.","ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, went offline in US.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.

Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google Drive now allows users to stream videos immediately after they are uploaded. This update marks the latest in a series of enhancements to the platform's video playback capabilities.

This improvement follows a major overhaul of Drive's video player in October, which introduced a refreshed user interface and new playback controls.These video-focused upgrades are part of a broader effort by Google to enhance Drive's functionality.
