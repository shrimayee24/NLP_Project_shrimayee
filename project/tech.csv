NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

A look at Cowboys star CeeDee Lamb's luxury car collection following his Week 17 loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-look-at-cowboys-star-ceedee-lambs-luxury-car-collection-following-his-week-17-loss/articleshow/126275760.cms,"Cowboys star CeeDee Lamb has a taste for luxury cars





Fans are divided on Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb; while many fans think he’s had one truly elite season and could be a one-season wonder, others believe that he has great potential and is only having a few bad weeks.It was reported early this year that CeeDee Lamb finalised a four-year, $136 million contract extension with the Cowboys shortly before the start of the regular season. Later, the deal was reworked to free up an additional $20 million in cap space for Dallas this offseason. However, Lamb isn't one to splurge on random things; he knows how to use his money well, at least that's what his luxury purchases suggestEven during his rookie contract, Lamb showed a taste for high-end automobiles and purchased a customised Lamborghini Urus. The unique super-SUV was created in collaboration with Road Show International. The customised Lamborghini Urus boasts a stylised wide-body design with carbon fibre detailing throughout the interior and exterior, finished in a striking orange paint job that immediately stands out.The super-SUV was significantly enhanced under the hood as well. The Urus is powered by a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 that was tuned to produce an additional 260 horsepower, pushing its total output to an incredible 901 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque.With that setup, the vehicle can sprint from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.8 seconds and reach a top speed of 210 mph. It also rides on Gloss Black Forgiato wheels with Hermès accents.Inside, the Lamborghini comfortably seats five and features a custom wide-grip steering wheel along with a fully upgraded sound system.This isn’t the only vehicle Lamb has personalised. He has previously partnered with Road Show International to customise a black Jeep Trackhawk and a Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as well. While the exact cost of the modified Urus hasn’t been revealed, a standard, non-custom version starts at $225,500, according to TrueCar.Dallas secured him through the 2028 season with a massive deal that includes a record-setting $38 million signing bonus for a wide receiver and $100 million in guaranteed money.","CeeDee Lamb signed a four-year, $136 million contract extension with the Cowboys earlier this year.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.Rockstar has not announced the official price for India. However, early industry estimates suggest the standard edition may be priced around ₹9,000, which is much higher than GTA V’s console launch price of ₹3,499.","Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take- Two-owned gaming studio.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now?

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is hiring in Singapore





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring.

The founder responds







Indian-origin startup founders are facing a hard time with their companies right now. From being blackmailed to being defamed, anything is up for grabs when it comes to them. Recently, a 16-year-old Indian-origin founder has called out a customer for bullying and threatening to 'destroy' his startup over what he claims is a misunderstanding.Om Patel, a Canada-based entrepreneur shared that the customer began threatening him after facing a login issue, even though it was fixed immediately. Patel, is the founder of BigIdeasDB. In a September 2025 interview with Indieniche, he described his startup as “a platform that helps entrepreneurs and founders discover validated startup ideas by analysing real user complaints from G2 reviews, App Store reviews, and Reddit threads. ”It was during the COVID pandemic, that Patel began to learn coding at the age of 12. He launched his startup in early 2024 and since then, it has generated over CAD$23,000 in revenue.Earlier this week, a customer named Adam emailed Patel and called his product a scam. He demanded an immediate refund, failing which he threatened to post negative feedback about the company on “every Hackernews article and Reddit post”.“Hi, as you know, this product is clearly a scam. The content is fake, the login does not work (redirects to localhost), and the platform is broken. Either refund immediately or I will:Adam's email was sent at 9:45 pm and within four minutes Patel responded saying an update had been pushed which would fix the problem in under 30 minutes. “Somehow, a pull request was merged into main with a redirect to localhost (that's why you weren't able to get in) after the Stripe Webhook was created,” he explained.“I can assure you this product is NOT a scam, just a simple misunderstanding and that's 100% on our part,” he added. Adam however, did not buy the explanation and pushed on his demand for a refund.Thus, Patel took the matter to X. He shared the screenshots of their exchange and accused Adam of trying to ""destroy"" his startup and reputation. He claimed the customer continued with his threats even after the refund was processed.He explained that Adam purchased a subscription to his product but found a login issue within minutes. “I offered a full refund immediately. No questions asked. Problem solved, right? Wrong. Even AFTER processing his refund, he continued with threats and hostile messages.”Additionally, he also accused the customer of bullying him because of his age. ""Some people think they can bully you because of your age. Imagine being so entitled that a 30-second technical glitch makes you try to destroy a 16-year-old's entire future,"" he wrote at the end of the post.The netizens rallied behind the founder, advising him to move on and continue improving his startup.","Om Patel, a 16-year-old Indian-origin founder has called out a customer for bullying and threatening to 'destroy' his startup over what he claims is a misunderstanding.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said.

Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year’s Eve celebration. The centerpiece, as always, is the Burj Khalifa, where Emaar has planned a record-breaking fusion of pyrotechnics, LED light displays, and synchronized fountain shows. This year, the ""Brightest Show on Earth"" will feature a new laser choreography designed to be visible from miles away.Dubai’s New Year’s Eve fireworks display is set to be one of the most spectacular globally, with the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai as the centerpiece. Fireworks will light up the skyline starting at midnight, with a staggering 48 fireworks displays across 40 approved locations. While the Burj Khalifa remains the ""Main Event"" with its record-breaking laser and pyrotechnic show titled, there are plenty of other world-class spots to ring in the New Year.Getting into central Downtown Dubai requires a tactical plan as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) implements a massive, phased closure strategy. To keep the city moving, authorities will begin shutting down major road arteries as early as 4:00 PM on December 31..The RTA strongly advises residents and tourists to reach their destinations before 4:00 PM. Once a road is closed, it will remain closed until well after the fireworks end, usually until 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM on January 1, to allow for the safe dispersal of millions of spectators.If you are planning to head to the Burj Khalifa area, the Dubai Metro is your best friend, but it comes with specific rules. The Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station is expected to close or become ""exit-only"" as early as 5:00 PM to prevent overcrowding on the platforms. If you arrive after this time, you will likely be redirected to the Financial Centre or Business Bay stations.To bridge the gap, the RTA is deploying a fleet of over 200 ""shuttle buses"" that will transport visitors from remote parking lots (like Al Wasl and Al Jafiliya) to the Downtown area for free. Taxis will be in high demand, and ""Dubai Taxi"" and Uber/Careem will have designated pick-up zones, though wait times can exceed two hours after the clock strikes twelve. Using a Nol card with a balance of at least AED 20 is essential to avoid long queues at ticket machines.","Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year's Eve celebration.

Air inside classrooms, homes, and offices often goes unnoticed, even though it shapes daily health and comfort. A new system introduced in Abu Dhabi is set to change how indoor air is tracked, assessed, and managed across the emirate.The Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) has launched the Indoor Air Quality Observatory, known as HawAQM, representing a major step forward in monitoring indoor air pollutants and protecting public health. The system is designed to provide continuous, real-time data on indoor air quality in a variety of environments, ranging from schools and residential homes to offices and other indoor facilities.HawAQM relies on high precision sensors installed at selected locations throughout the emirate. These sophisticated devices monitor key indoor air pollutants constantly and transmit the information in real time. The collected data is displayed on a dedicated HawAQM dashboard, allowing specialists and decision-makers to quickly assess conditions and take timely action to maintain safe and healthy indoor environments.The observatory is part of a broader public health strategy led by ADPHC, reflecting a commitment to proactive health protection.By covering a wide range of indoor spaces, HawAQM ensures that both public and private facilities benefit from continuous monitoring. The system not only increases awareness of air quality but also enables experts to respond immediately when conditions require intervention, preventing potential health risks before they escalate.By combining advanced technology, precise analytics, and real-time monitoring, HawAQM strengthens oversight of indoor environments across Abu Dhabi.

Dubai new e-scooter safety rules: What riders must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-e-scooter-safety-rules-what-riders-must-know/articleshow/126184645.cms,"Dubai tightens e-scooter safety rules across public roads / Image: File

RTA ’s key e-scooter safety rules

Riders must follow posted speed limits and stay in designated scooter or shared lanes.

Wearing helmets and bright or reflective clothing is strongly advised to stay visible.

Scooters should maintain a safe distance from pedestrians, bicycles, and other riders.

Clear new guidelines

E-scooters must be clean, dry, and folded before boarding public transport vehicles.

They can only be stored in designated areas and must be securely immobilized during travel.

A maximum of two scooters per journey is allowed to avoid crowding and obstruction.

Certain modes, like intercity buses, prohibit e-scooters altogether.



Penalties





Dubai is moving faster toward a greener future, and e-scooters have become the star of the show. Whether you’re zipping through Dubai Marina or using a scooter to bridge the gap between your home and the office, these nimble vehicles are everywhere. However, as their popularity has surged, so has the need for clear, common-sense rules.The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly. Officials say the changes reflect the city’s commitment to safe, orderly mobility, whether you’re riding a scooter, hopping on a metro, or walking down a busy street.The RTA has been actively reminding residents and visitors about essential safety guidelines as e-scooter use grows. These rules help reduce accidents and ensure everyone shares the roads and paths responsibly:The RTA has stressed that safe riding is a shared responsibility between riders and all road users. Taking personal precautions, obeying traffic rules, and being aware of surroundings help prevent incidents as e-scooter trips become part of daily life.One of the most practical changes affects how scooters interact with Dubai’s mass transit system. The RTA has outlined eight safety requirements for carrying e-scooters on public transport such as buses, designed to protect passengers and streamline boarding:These rules reinforce that while scooters are a flexible transport mode, they must be carried responsibly when combined with buses or other services to ensure safety for everyone on board.Dubai isn’t just reminding riders of rules; authorities are backing them with clear penalties to reinforce compliance. According to official summaries of RTA and Dubai Police enforcement, Riding without a permit or outside designated zones can lead to fines of about Dhs200–Dhs300.Not wearing a helmet, riding on jog or pedestrian paths, or ignoring speed limits carries fines. Riding dangerously, like against traffic, or parking scooters in unsafe spots can be penalized as well.These fines are part of a broader effort to keep micro-mobility safe without limiting access. Authorities note that proper permits, gear, and adherence to rules help riders enjoy scooters while minimising risks to others.E-scooters have become a visible symbol of micro-mobility in Dubai, popular for short journeys, last-mile connectivity, and easy travel between public transport stops. Yet, as their numbers rise, so do safety conversations.Recent community actions, such as e-scooter bans in some park areas and restrictions in crowded urban plazas, reflect the city’s careful balancing act between freedom of movement and public safety.As the RTA continues refining regulations and promoting awareness campaigns, officials emphasise that courtesy, caution, and compliance will make Dubai’s shared roads safer for riders, pedestrians, and commuters alike.","The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Features

The first two prototypes of the Vande Bharat sleeper have 16 coaches, including 11 air-conditioned three-tier coaches, four air-conditioned two-tier coaches, and one air-conditioned first-class coach.

Designed as a semi-high-speed service, the train can operate at speeds of up to 160 kmph, with testing conducted at 180 kmph. However, actual operating speeds will depend on track capabilities across the Indian Railways network.

Drawing on design elements from European rolling stock, the sleeper coaches will offer cushioned berths for improved comfort, along with redesigned upper-berth access to make climbing easier.

Passenger amenities include low-intensity night lighting, audio announcements supported by visual display systems, CCTV surveillance, and modular pantry arrangements.

The train will be fitted with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Facilities will include an accessible toilet for persons with disabilities, a baby care unit, and shower cubicles with hot water in the AC First Class coach.

Safety systems include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision technology. Like the chair car version, the sleeper variant will also feature regenerative braking to enhance energy efficiency.

Coaches are equipped with fully sealed gangways and automatic interconnecting doors, helping maintain interior air quality and stable temperature levels.

Each coach offers individual reading lamps, charging sockets, foldable refreshment tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will open automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System has been installed, along with emergency communication facilities that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive driver.

Vande Bharat sleeper train to be launched soon! Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday shared an important update on the Vande Bharat sleeper train, posting a video on X (formerly Twitter) of the train’s speed trial. The new train touched 180 kmph speeds - its maximum- during trial runs between the Kota-Nagda section of the Indian Railways network.What caught the attention was the finely balanced glasses of water from which not a drop of spilt despite the train touching its maximum design speed of 180 kmph. “Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner Railway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw posted on X.Vande Bharat sleeper train is set to be launched soon for long-distance overnight travel. As the name suggests, the train is a sleeper class variant of the Vande Bharat chair car train that is currently in service on the Indian Railways network. Two prototype rakes of the all air-conditioned Vande Bharat sleeper train have been manufactured by BEML and are currently in testing phase.Indian Railways is preparing a major overhaul of long-distance rail travel, with plans to introduce more than 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trains over the next few years.Multiple manufacturing programmes are underway to support this initiative.Also Read | Vande Bharat sleeper, Amrit Bharat with AC coaches & more - what will train travel on Indian Railways look like in 2026?

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

‘Remove 10-Minute Delivery Option’: Gig Workers Launch Nationwide Strike On New Year’s Eve

A nationwide New Year's eve strike to protest low pay and lack of social security benefits elicited a mixed response from delivery workers, even as app-based platforms offered festive bonuses in a bid to counter delayed service and manpower shortage. Most customers had no clue about the strike but several orders were inordinately delayed.Anticipating one of the busiest days for food and grocery delivery platforms, Eternal, Swiggy and Zepto raised pay per order for delivery partners. ""Platforms which usually pay us Rs 5-Rs 10 for delivering an order are offering an incentive in the range of Rs 110-150 per order,"" said Shaik Salauddin, founder president at Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union, which is leading the protest alongside Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers. Aggregators were also offering to waive penalties on order denials and cancellations.However, a section of workers refused to relent. Siddhesh Patil (name changed), said aggregators were flooding them with New Year's Eve offers of incentives and 'double earnings', ""but these targets are impossible to achieve, anyway"". Those on strike risked having their IDs blocked by the aggregator as a punitive measure, he added.""On festivals and special days like Dec 31 and Jan 1, we don't manage to convert many food delivery orders because restaurants are packed and can't process online orders fast enough,"" he said. So even if Zomato or Swiggy promised him an extra Rs 90 per order to cover the 6-10pm rush hour slot and guaranteed a payout of Rs 2,175 to complete 19 orders in six hours, he'd still fall short of the target, he said. ""On an average day, I complete 20 orders between 9am and 11pm. Last New Year's Eve I completed 15 orders with difficulty.""On Dec 30, Zomato had sent a letter to all its employees assuring them ""no delivery partner will face any obstruction while delivering orders. So, on 31st Dec, 2025, log in without worry and earn up to Rs 3,500."" The letter went on to promise workers of on-field assistance to ""ensure their safety"" and even encouraged them to call the police if they faced interruptions.Union leaders interpret the letter as a sign that aggregators now recognise the growing resistance as a force to be reckoned with. Salauddin said they were urging gig workers to not get tempted. ""This is not a genuine solution to long-standing issues,"" said Salauddin.Gig workers are protesting pressure from 10-minute delivery models. They also seek an end to arbitrary incentive structures, ID blocking, penalties and reduction in per-order payouts.To avoid any disruptions, many restaurants are relying on their own apps and in-house delivery fleet, leveraging the situation to gain direct consumers. ""We have stepped up focus on our Wow Eats app and have been sending mass emails,"" said Sagar Daryani, co-founder & CEO at Wow! Momo Foods. Some restaurants are partnering with Shadowfax and Rapido, Daryani said. Kolkata-based restaurant Chowman said it is pushing its own app orders so that the firm's in-house fleet can seamlessly support any potential shortfall.","Gig workers are protesting pressure from 10-minute delivery models.

Will Vibe Coding take away tech jobs

How Collins Dictionary defines Vibe Coding





This year, or in February 2025 to be precise, Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, gave the technology world a new word -- Vibe Coding. Karpathy came up with the word to represent how AI can let some programmers ""forget that the code even exists"" and ""give in to the vibes"" while making a computer program. The word became an overnight buzzword in Silicon Valley. And as the year ended, UK's Collins Dictionary picked it up as the word of the year. It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025.As to how Andrej Karpathy described the word, here's the definition Karpathy shared on Twitter, ""I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like a skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering.Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.""Is Vibe Coding and advanced capabilities of AI just the nail in the coffin when it comes to the traditional views of computer programming and software development skills? The debate is ongoing, with strong voices on both sides. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan told CNBC earlier this year that app developers can now offload or automate more repetitive tasks, and they can generate new code using Large Language Models (LLMs). The ability for AI to subsidize an otherwise heavy workload has allowed these companies to build with fewer people."" Tan said. “That sounds a little scary, but on the other hand, what that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers. You know, maybe it’s that engineer who couldn’t get a job at Meta or Google, who actually can build a standalone business making 10 or 100 million dollars a year with 10 people,” Tan says. “Like that’s such a powerful moment in software."" Tan tweeted another not-so-happy stat for engineers: 25% of the current crop of Y Combinator startups used LLMs (AI large language models) to write 95% of their lines of code.Cursor CEO Michael Truell recently warned that Vibe coding builds ‘shaky foundations’ and eventually ‘things start to crumble’. Truell reportedly likened it to building a house by putting up four walls and a roof without knowing what’s going on under the floorboards or with the wiring. This coding method may be perfect for AI users looking to quickly mock up a game or website, but when it comes to more advanced programming, things have the potential to go wrong, he warned, as per a report in Fortune. “If you close your eyes and you don’t look at the code and you have AIs build things with shaky foundations as you add another floor, and another floor, and another floor, and another floor, things start to kind of crumble,” he said.Alex Beecroft, managing director of Collins, said, “The selection of ‘vibe coding’ as Collins’ Word of the Year perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology.” Collins’ definition of Vibe Coding states, “vibe coding” is “the use of artificial intelligence prompted by natural language to assist with the writing of computer code.” Or, as a blog post on the dictionary’s website explains: “Basically, telling a machine what you want rather than painstakingly coding it yourself. ”","Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, came up with the word Vibe Coding.

As the AI race hot up in 2025, the corporate leadership in Google, Microsoft, Meta and other tech companies changed the way companies work. Driven by the high stakes of the AI race, the world’s most powerful tech leaders shifted into what Silicon Valley calls “Founder Mode”. From personally walking factory lines to writing code, these five CEOs are personally architecting their companies' future success.Google co-founder Sergey Brin returned “full-time” to spearhead Google’s AI offensive after ‘Code Red’ situation at the company. Brin’s is said to have spearheaded Antigravity, the company’s newly-unveiled agent-first coding platform. Interestingly, Brin also featured prominently in the launch video alongside the team from Windsurf (acquired for $2.4 billion). Brin is reportedly in the office “pretty much every day,” working on Gemini model training.Despite being a “professional CEO” and not a founder, Satya Nadella’s 2025 behaviour has been described by Microsoft’s Deputy CTO Dee Templeton as “Founder Mode”. According to a report by the Financial Times, Nadella has flattened Microsoft’s hierarchy, overhauled senior leadership, and hiring key figures like Meta’s Jay Parikh to create a direct line to his office.Nadella is said to be working hard to better compete with Amazon and Google in infrastructure.Earlier this year, Tesla and Samsung announced a chip partnership. Company CEO Elon Musk said would “walk the line personally” at Samsung’s new Texas facility to accelerate progress. He also secured an agreement allowing Tesla engineers to assist Samsung in “maximizing manufacturing efficiency” to ensure Tesla's hardware timeline stays ahead of the industry.Mark Zuckerberg has made a ‘Superintelligence’ team for billions of dollars, pivoting Meta towards “startup mode” by concentrating power in the hands of elite, talent-dense units. The company’s goal is frontier research and Zuckerberg believes small teams are the “optimal configuration” for winning the AI arms race.Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has publicly slammed conventional leadership advice to ""get out of the way."" Chesky manages his $79 billion company like a startup, personally handling “hire, fire, promote, and manage” decisions for employees several levels below his direct reports. Chesky argues that ""skip-leveling"", which is talking directly to those reporting to his management team, is the only way to maintain a relationship with the people doing the work.","The world’s most powerful tech leaders shifted into what Silicon Valley calls ‘Founder Mode’ in 2025.

Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable phone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"
TSMC begins mass production of advanced 2nm chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-begins-mass-production-of-advanced-2nm-chips/articleshow/126268612.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: TSMC is doing a very good job







Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the word’s largest contract chipmaker has announced that it has started mass production of its 2‑nanometer (nm) chips, marking a major milestone in semiconductor technology. As reported AFP, TSMC said that the new 2nm process node represents its most advanced technology to date. The chips are designed to offer higher performance as compared to the 3nm chipset.The 2nm chips from TSMC are also low on power consumption which make them useful for mobile devices and AI workloads. Also, the smaller transistor size of the chips enables them to offer more computing power in compact designs.The company confirmed that production has begun at its facilities in Hsinchu and Baoshan, Taiwan, with plans to expand capacity in the coming year.It is also said that the next-generation TSMC 2nm chips may power the next-generation iPhones and AI servers. The company is also said to be working on new fabs in Arizona, Japan, and Germany, part of a global diversification strategy amid geopolitical tensions.The launch of 2nm chips comes at a time when demand for AI accelerators, smartphones, and high‑performance computing is surging globally. TSMC’s move positions it ahead of rivals Samsung Electronics and Intel, both racing to develop similar next‑generation nodes.Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia recently praised its longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Speaking to reporters at an event held by TSMC in Hsinchu (Taiwan), Huang said “TSMC is doing a very good job supporting us on wafers”, adding that Nvidia's success would not be possible without TSMC. Huang is on a fourth public trip to Taiwan this year.According to a Reuters report, the chipmaker CEO also told reporters that it is experiencing ""very strong demand"" for its Blackwell chips.“Nvidia builds the GPU (graphics processing units), but we also build the CPU (central processing units), the networking, the switches, and so there are a lot of chips associated with Blackwell”.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the word’s largest contract chipmaker has announced that it has started mass production of its 2‑nanometer (nm) chips.
