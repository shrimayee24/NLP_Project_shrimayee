Candace Owens questions Erika Kirk’s role in The Charlie Kirk Show Spotify, Apple, and YouTube removal

From Viral Clip To Trust Crisis: Erika Kirk Faces Mounting Backlash | WATCH





Candace Owens has sparked a fresh debate inside conservative media. She publicly questioned whether Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, ordered the removal of The Charlie Kirk Show from major streaming platforms. Owens claimed the podcast archive disappeared from Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube soon after Erika Kirk stepped into a leadership role at Turning Point USA following her husband’s death. Listeners quickly checked for themselves. Many confirmed that full past episodes no longer appear on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. The show’s YouTube presence is also limited, with full archives missing.However, episodes are still available on Rumble and on the official Turning Point USA website. So the show has not vanished completely. The real question now: who made the decision, and why? Candace Owens wrote online, “Not to be awkward, but one of the early actions his wife took as the new CEO was to have ALL of the Charlie Kirk Show episodes removed from Spotify, Apple, and YouTube.” Her statement led to strong reactions from supporters and critics alike.Candace Owens suggested the removals were unlikely to be random.She argued that multiple platforms taking down the same content at the same time “strongly suggested organisational direction.” When a user told her she had provided “zero evidence,” Owens did not step back. Instead, she pointed to the timing and said the situation raised fair concerns.As of now, there is no verified proof showing that Erika Kirk directly instructed Spotify, Apple, or YouTube to remove the podcast. None of the three platforms has released a public statement explaining the change. Turning Point USA has also not issued a detailed clarification about who requested the removal.A Turning Point USA affiliate reportedly told supporters in an email that the situation was “a product of how they choose to handle shows like ours with a high number of episodes.” That message suggested platform management policies could have played a role. Some supporters have also mentioned possible contract issues involving Salem Media Group, which previously distributed the show. Still, there is no official confirmation tying any single reason to the removal.Charlie Kirk died on September 10, 2025, after a fatal shooting during a campus event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Authorities later arrested a suspect in connection with the case. Since then, leadership decisions at Turning Point USA have faced closer attention. Owens has openly criticised certain moves made after his death.Erika Kirk has not publicly responded to Owens’ latest comments. For now, the podcast remains available on alternative platforms, while debate continues over who controls its distribution and why it left mainstream streaming services.","Candace Owens questioned whether Erika Kirk ordered the removal of The Charlie Kirk Show from major streaming platforms.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar Vembu said Sarvam AI's work shows that ‘world-class AI’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

EU Parliament wants lawmakers to clean up their personal phones too

TikTok ban , Microsoft pushback—the EU has done this before

The European Parliament has killed built-in AI features on work devices handed to lawmakers and staff. The reason? Cybersecurity and data protection concerns. The decision came through an internal email sent on Monday, first reported by Politico. The Parliament's e-MEP tech support desk flagged a specific problem—some AI tools were quietly shipping data to cloud servers for tasks the device could handle on its own. ""As these features continue to evolve and become available on more devices, the full extent of data shared with service providers is still being assessed. Until this is fully clarified, it is considered safer to keep such features disabled,"" the email said.What got the axe? Writing assistants, summarizing tools, enhanced virtual assistants, and webpage summary features on tablets and phones, an EU official told Politico. Everyday stuff like email, calendar, and apps still works fine.The email didn't stop at work devices. It asked lawmakers to ""consider applying similar precautions"" on personal phones and tablets used for work. The advice was pointed—don't feed work emails or internal documents to AI features that scan content.Stay wary of third-party AI apps. And don't hand them broad access to your data.This isn't new territory for the European Parliament. It banned TikTok on staff devices back in 2023. In November 2025, a group of lawmakers even pushed to ditch Microsoft software for a European alternative, Politico had reported.The timing is worth noting though. While the Parliament locks down AI on its devices, European citizens are embracing these tools. Eurostat data from December 2025 shows 32.7% of EU residents aged 16-74 used generative AI tools in 2025. Denmark topped the chart at 48.4%.The Parliament refused to name which specific AI features were disabled or what operating systems the devices run.",European Parliament has disabled built-in AI features on work devices due to cybersecurity and data protection fears.

‘Everything software is suspect’: Jim Cramer

Jim Cramer, one of America’s biggest investors recently questioned the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in high stake jobs, saying he remains unconvinced that major law firms can fully rely on AI. Sharing a post on X (formerly Twitter), Cramer wrote: “I know AI will get better but can someone tell me one major law firm that would rely on this stuff for a real, paying client and still be able to sleep at night?”. Referring to Anthropic’s AI model, he said relying on AI in critical legal matters would require a level of certainty that he believes is not yet guaranteed. “Can i trust all of that great Anthropic code? I guess i can; guessing's for jokers where I'm from,” he wrote.His comments come amid growing adoption of AI tools across industries. Last month, Anthropic launched Claude Cowork – an agentic AI assistant that can read files, organise folders, draft documents and carry out multi-step tasks with user consent. Soon after its launch, the company released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork that triggered what analysts then called a 'SaaSpocalypse'—a brutal selloff that wiped out roughly $300 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single trading session.The 11 plugins enable companies to tailor Claude for doing specific job functions by specifying how work should be done, which tools and data to pull from, and what workflows to automate. Anthropic open-sourced 11 starter plugins covering productivity, sales, marketing, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management and biology research.Commenting on the IT stock sell off then, Cramer said that the Wall Street has decided that “everything software must be thrown away, anything remotely connected to software is suspect, including companies that just collect data”. “But any client — a bank, a consumer-packaged goods company, an industrial company — is golden, at least for now,” he added.","Jim Cramer, one of America’s biggest investors recently questioned the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in high stake jobs.

MEERUT: The upcoming Meerut Metro is set to become the fastest metro service in the country, with a maximum operational speed of 120 kmph, significantly reducing travel time across the city, an official said.The service will run along a 21-kilometre corridor between Meerut South and Modipuram, with 12 stations, and is expected to cover the entire stretch in around 30 minutes, including stoppages at all stations, the official said on Monday, according to news agency PTI.In a first-of-its-kind initiative in India, the Meerut Metro will operate on the same tracks and infrastructure as the semi-high-speed Namo Bharat trains, creating an integrated transport model that combines regional rapid transit with city metro services, the official said.According to the official, the metro will feature modern stainless-steel trainsets with a lightweight design and a distinctive fluorescent green, blue and orange colour scheme.The three-coach trains are energy-efficient, fitted with regenerative braking systems, and compatible with Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Operation technologies, he added.Each fully air-conditioned train will have a capacity of over 700 passengers, including 173 seated commuters, and will provide a mix of transverse and longitudinal cushioned seating.Luggage racks, USB charging ports, and reserved seating for women, senior citizens and passengers with disabilities have also been provided, the official said.He further said that safety and accessibility have been incorporated into the system’s design, with CCTV surveillance across stations and trains, platform screen doors at all stations, and universal access features such as lifts, wheelchair spaces and dedicated areas for stretchers.The Meerut Metro is expected to improve daily commuting, strengthen connectivity and boost economic and social activity in the city, the official said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will soon inaugurate the metro services, making Meerut the fifth city in Uttar Pradesh to have a metro network.Before the launch of the Meerut Metro, the highest operational speed on an Indian metro corridor was 110 kmph on the Delhi Airport Express Line.","The service will run along a 21-kilometre corridor between Meerut South and Modipuram, with 12 stations.

The fashion impact beyond the blue shirt

Why the blue shirt trending now





In an era of viral gowns and headline-grabbing couture, it is not a crystal-encrusted dress or archival tiara setting the fashion agenda but a crisp, powder-blue button-down shirt. The most talked-about piece in royal and style circles this week is this sharply tailored Oxford shirt from London label With Nothing Underneath, worn within days by Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex and American Vogue’s editorial heavyweight Chloe Malle.In fashion terms, that is less coincidence and more cultural signal because when three women who define modern power dressing across monarchy, media and Montecito reach for the same quietly confident staple, it tells us that 2026 is not about excess. It is about precision, polish and above all, it is about the enduring magnetism of a perfectly cut shirt.The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style. The British fashion label is suddenly dominating the style conversation and it is not for a gown or a handbag but the classic blue button-down shirt.The light-blue button-down from London label With Nothing Underneath, popularly known as WNU, has popped up on multiple high-profile figures within days as Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales wore it under a tailored blazer during a visit to Castle Hill Academy in South London to mark Children’s Mental Health Week while Chloe Malle, editorial head of American Vogue, styled it in a video interview alongside icon Anna Wintour . Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, too has worn WNU shirts in the past, including a linen version on her Netflix seriesIt is rare for figures from different royal households, especially ones with distinct personal brands and a top fashion editor to converge on the same piece, which speaks to both the shirt’s versatility and subtle cultural momentum.Founded in 2017 by Pip Durell, a former Tatler and British Vogue professional, With Nothing Underneath specialises in classic shirting inspired by men’s tailoring but sized and proportioned for women. The shirts are inspired by men’s tailoring, British heritage and timeless style, out of Durell’s personal search for shirts that were perfectly adjusted for women, sustainably sourced and stood the test of time.They were borne after years of adjusting men’s shirts for her own use. Combining her fashion knowledge and styling credentials with her own very English, effortless approach to dressing, the brand was launched from her home city of London. Today it has grown to encompass an array of wardrobe essentials, from shirts to tailored trousers, that are not led by trends or fleeting style moments instead, they are designed to be forever items in which to live a life of simplicity. In other words, With Nothing Underneath is not just selling shirts; it is helping define a moment in style that blends classic elegance, accessibility and modern wardrobe versatility.They are pared back, laid back, timeless and effortless clothing and inspired by Carolyn Bessette, Jane Birkin and Charlotte Rampling . The label’s success is measurable with £5.7 million in sales in 2024 and 88% growth over three years. It ranked 52nd on The Sunday Times Hundred list of fastest-growing UK private companies. These numbers suggest that WNU is more than a fleeting celebrity endorsement, it is a brand on the rise.The “Royal effect” still matters. Kate’s sartorial choices have long influenced high street fashion, an impact sometimes referred to as the Kate effect, which can boost British brands by hundreds of millions annually and it is not just high-end. Mainstream retailers are seeing similar spikes. For example:These accessible pieces benefit when “royal style” filters down to everyday wardrobes. This moment also fits a wider fashion pattern in early 2026. Light-blue button-downs are showing up in style guides as versatile essentials for office and casual wear.Colour combinations like pale blue with chocolate brown are being touted as must-try seasonal pairings. Meghan has long embraced similar shirting pieces, reinforcing that timeless tailoring, especially shirts, remains central to polished and “quiet luxury” wardrobes.This is not just about one shirt. It shows how royal wardrobes can shape fashion trends globally. It marks a rare fashion overlap between two of the most watched public figures of the decade and highlights how quality basics, not only flashier pieces, can become cultural touchpoints.","The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style.

First solar eclipse of 2026: Can UAE residents see the ‘Ring of Fire’ on February 17?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/first-solar-eclipse-of-2026-can-uae-residents-see-the-ring-of-fire-on-february-17/articleshow/128409351.cms,"Skywatchers worldwide are preparing for the first solar eclipse of 2026, set to occur on February 17, 2026 / AI Image

What is the ‘Ring of Fire’ eclipse?

How to watch from the UAE?



The partial phase begins at 1:56 PM UAE time (GST), with the ""Ring of Fire"" reaching its peak at 4:12 PM UAE time.

Look for live streams from NASA or the Virtual Telescope Project. These broadcasts will provide high-definition views from the frozen continent, allowing you to enjoy the celestial choreography without the 14-hour flight or the sub-zero temperatures.

Next eclipse coming in August





Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026. Known as an ""annular"" eclipse, it happens when the Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun, leaving a brilliant, fiery ring visible around its edges.However, for those of us in the UAE, there is a catch: the ""Path of Annularity"" is incredibly narrow and remote, sweeping almost exclusively over Antarctica.Because the alignment happens while the Sun is below our local horizon, the eclipse will be entirely invisible from the UAE sky. While we won’t see the sky go dark over the Burj Khalifa, the event remains a major global scientific milestone. Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026.The term “ring of fire” refers to the bright circle of sunlight that remains visible during an annular solar eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, temporarily blocking sunlight. However, during an annular eclipse, the Moon is slightly farther away from Earth in its orbit.Because of this increased distance, the Moon appears smaller in the sky and cannot completely cover the Sun’s surface.Instead of plunging the sky into darkness like a total solar eclipse, a thin, brilliant ring of sunlight surrounds the Moon’s dark silhouette.This glowing halo creates the dramatic “ring of fire” effect that captivates skywatchers. Unlike a total solar eclipse, an annular eclipse never produces full darkness because a portion of the Sun always remains visible. During the February 17, 2026 event, this striking ring effect will last for up to about two minutes and twenty seconds at peak viewing locations.Just because you can't see it from your balcony doesn't mean you have to miss the show. Since the eclipse unfolds in one of the most desolate places on Earth, several space agencies and research stations in Antarctica are preparing to share the view.If February feels like a missed opportunity, there is good news. A total solar eclipse will occur on August 12, 2026, visible across parts of Europe including Spain and Iceland. While it will still not be visible from the UAE, it is geographically closer and may attract eclipse chasers from the region planning travel.Additionally, 2026 will feature other astronomical highlights, including lunar eclipses and meteor showers that may be visible from UAE skies.","The first solar eclipse of 2026 will occur on February 17, 2026.

UAE's new Salik toll fees adjustments for Ramadan 2026: What drivers in emirates need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uaes-new-salik-toll-fees-adjustments-for-ramadan-2026-what-drivers-in-emirates-need-to-know/articleshow/128420631.cms,"Ramadan 2026: How Will Salik Toll Fees Affect Your Dubai Commute?

What is changing with Salik toll fees in the UAE



Monday to Saturday



Dh6 (peak rate): 9 am – 5 pm

9 am – 5 pm Dh4 (off-peak rate): 7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am

7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am Free (off-peak): 2 am – 7 am

Sunday (excluding public holidays and events)



Dh4 (both peak and off-peak): 7 am – 2 am

7 am – 2 am Free: 2 am – 7 am

Why the Salik toll structure is changing in the UAE

Later starts and shorter days during Ramadan mean peak travel times often shift compared to the rest of the year.

Salik’s new timing accounts for this by extending lower toll periods into early evening and late night, periods when many residents are commuting for iftar (sunset fast-breaking) and evening prayers or social engagements.

Free toll hours in the early pre-dawn period (2 am – 7 am) support non-peak travel and reflect typical reduced road usage.

Quick takeaways for UAE drivers



Expect different Salik charges during Ramadan 2026, with peak hours now between 9 am and 5 pm.

Off-peak and late-night travel is cheaper or free, encouraging motorists to travel outside busy hours.

Adjust your commuting plans, especially around iftar and early mornings, to avoid unexpected toll charges.





With Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19), pending the official moon sighting on February 17, Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month. These updates aim to improve traffic flow and commuting comfort in line with altered work and school schedules across the city.Salik has introduced a variable pricing structure for toll gates during Ramadan 2026 to better align with expected traffic patterns:These adjustments reflect the shifted daily rhythm in Ramadan, where working hours and schooling usually start later and end earlier to accommodate fasting, prayer, and family time.The revised toll schedule is not simply about price, it is part of a broader strategy to smooth traffic flow across Dubai’s busiest routes during Ramadan:Similar adjustments have been reported in other transport and city services as part of Ramadan preparation, including variable parking timings and public transport schedule shifts. These toll changes come alongside wider seasonal shifts across the UAE as communities prepare for Ramadan.Work hours and school schedules are reduced or revised for the holy month to help residents observe fasting and prayer times comfortably. Other services like parking fees and public transit operations are also adjusted to better align with Ramadan routines. The adjustments aim to support both residents and visitors during what is one of the most significant months in the UAE’s cultural and religious calendar.As Ramadan approaches, keeping track of these changes can help drivers in the UAE plan trips more efficiently and avoid higher toll costs in peak windows.", Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19) Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month.

'Suicide’ was actually hit-and-run: Dubai Police use AI-powered digital twin to crack case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suicide-was-actually-hit-and-run-dubai-police-use-ai-powered-digital-twin-to-crack-case/articleshow/128412079.cms,"Dubai Police use advanced Digital Twin technology to digitally reconstruct crime scenes / AI image

Dubai Police solve hit-and-run with AI tech

What is “Digital Twin” tech?

Smart policing in the UAE





Dubai has once again stepped into the future of law enforcement. The Dubai Police General Department of Forensic Evidence and Criminology has officially integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.This cutting-edge system creates a precise, high-definition virtual replica of a physical crime scene. By using advanced 3D scanning and laser mapping, detectives can now move through a digital version of a room or outdoor area with millimeter accuracy.This means the original environment is ""frozen in time,"" allowing investigators to examine every corner of a scene without actually being there physically.In a striking example of 21st-century policing, Dubai Police used its new Digital Twin technology to overturn the initial conclusion in a bridge-fall incident involving a delivery rider. What first appeared to be a suicide quickly became a hit-and-run case after investigators digitally reconstructed the scene.Using highly detailed 3D modelling and virtual reality tools, officers discovered that the rider’s motorcycle had been struck from behind by another vehicle, causing him to fall from the bridge. The fleeing driver left no trace at the scene, but the Digital Twin analysis offered clear visual and scientific evidence to rewrite the narrative and reclassify the case as a crime rather than a tragic self-inflicted act.This wasn’t the only success for the system. Digital Twin also solved a structural collapse investigation involving a basement parking facility. What appeared to be a mysterious failure was revealed through advanced modelling as the result of repeated water leakage that weakened concrete supports over time. By simulating load stresses with scientific precision, police could pinpoint the exact mechanism of collapse.Unlike traditional forensic methods that rely solely on physical evidence and witness statements, Digital Twin builds a virtual replica of a crime scene using cutting-edge technology. This system merges 3D scanning, artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics into a unified, interactive digital environment.Investigators can revisit this virtual scene at any time, examine evidence from multiple angles, test hypotheses, and even simulate possible sequences of events, all without returning physically to the location. The models are auditable, transparent and designed to support data-driven decision-making, making them especially valuable in courtrooms where evidence must withstand intense scrutiny.The Digital Twin process unfolds in three stages: first, the scene is digitally documented in full detail; then data is refined and enhanced; finally, advanced analytical tools produce intelligent models and outputs that help investigators understand what really happened.Since its rollout, the Digital Twin system has already clarified nearly 85 incidents, according to Dubai Police project managers. By virtually walking through these scenes, investigators can reduce errors, accelerate analysis time, and provide stronger, more reliable forensic conclusions in the judicial process.The Digital Twin initiative isn’t just innovative, it’s award-winning. The technology received a 7-star rating and was named Best Innovative Project at the International Best Practices Competition (IBPC) 2025, as well as winning the UAE Ideas Award 2025 in Smart Government and Digital Transformation.Senior police engineers highlight that Digital Twin is part of a broader strategy to embed technology and AI into all facets of law enforcement in Dubai. The goal is to make criminal investigations faster, more accurate, and more aligned with modern digital realities.This drive aligns with directives from leadership to position Dubai Police as a global leader in tech-powered law enforcement, a vision backed by investments in AI, virtual reality, and data analytics.","Dubai Police has integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.

Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","UAE has announced a strategic global partnership with Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX.

3,000-year-old Egyptian gold mine rediscovered in Sukari Mountains

Evidence of long-term life beyond the gold



Inside the lives of Sukari’s ancient gold workers







Archaeologists have uncovered what appears to be far more than a forgotten industrial site in Egypt’s eastern desert. Deep in the rugged Sukari Mountains, a 3,000-year-old Egyptian gold mine has come back into the light. And with it, traces of daily life that feel surprisingly vivid. This was not just a pit carved into rock but a place where people worked, worshipped, traded, and lived under the desert sun.The discovery forms part of a long-running project called “Reviving the Ancient City of Gold”, led by Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. What they found reportedly goes well beyond scattered tools or broken walls. Instead, it reveals a bustling gold-mining camp built around serious industry.The Sukari Mountains are still known for gold today. The modern Sukari Mine operates in the same region, which makes the ancient discovery feel oddly connected to the present. It seems the lure of gold here never really faded. People have been drawn to these rugged peaks for thousands of years, chasing wealth and power, and the echoes of their efforts linger in the rocks and soil.Archaeologists uncovered a remarkably advanced gold processing complex dating back roughly three millennia.Experts say the site included crushing and grinding stations used to break apart quartz veins that carried traces of gold. There were filtration basins, sediment tanks, and even clay furnaces designed for smelting and purifying the precious metal, along with work areas and storage pits that hint at a highly organised operation, sophisticated for its time and meticulously planned.According to the official website State Information Service Egypt , Mohamed Ismail Khaled of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities explained that the remains show a carefully orchestrated operation. Gold was not simply gathered. It was extracted, processed and refined with skill. The scale suggests planning. What makes this discovery especially compelling is that it wasn’t only about production. Around the mining complex, archaeologists identified what appears to be a full residential district.That detail alone hints at something bigger than a temporary encampment. It seems people settled here for generations. The team reportedly found architectural remains dating not just to the original pharaonic era but also to Roman and Islamic periods.Crews uncovered 628 fragments of pottery. Many pieces carry inscriptions in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek scripts. That linguistic mix suggests a diverse population passed through this desert hub. There were also bronze coins from the Ptolemaic era and terracotta figurines shaped like humans and animals. Small stone statues of deities, including Bastet and Harpocrates, some finished, others abandoned mid-carving. That unfinished detail feels oddly intimate. Among the artefacts were vessels that likely stored medicines and incense. Beads made from semi-precious stones and decorative items crafted from seashells and even five offering tables.","Archaeologists uncovered a remarkably advanced gold processing complex dating back roughly three millennia.

Dubai City Walk: A post-iftar social hub for Ramadan 2026



What this means for Dubai residents and visitors





As Ramadan 2026 begins from February 19 or 20, 2026, Dubai is rolling out one of its most ambitious celebration calendars yet, blending traditional spiritual observances with city-wide visual spectacles designed to unite residents, visitors and families after iftar every evening. From night-sky drone light shows to cultural installations and community gatherings, the emirate is turning Ramadan into a vibrant festival of light, art and shared experience under the stars.One of the standout features of Dubai’s 2026 Ramadan calendar is its coordinated drone light shows, which will illuminate the night sky with artistic formations inspired by the holy month. These shows are more than just pretty visuals; they are thematic stories expressed through technology that reflect Ramadan’s spirit of reflection, community and renewal.The drone displays will run nightly from February 19 to March 19, inviting audiences across the city to look up and engage with light as a medium of cultural storytelling. Dubai’s use of drones, a hallmark of its contemporary festival culture, represents a fusion of tradition and innovation in public celebrations.In addition to drones, fireworks displays will enliven key locations like Al Seef and Dubai Creek throughout Ramadan, creating shared moments of spectacle shortly after sunset.These fireworks, timed for post-iftar evenings, are designed to enhance the festive ambience of the season and give families and communities something to look forward to each night.The combination of fireworks and drones mirrors Dubai’s approach to past celebrations, like New Year’s Eve events and shopping festivals, where visual performances play a central role in citywide gatherings.Beyond aerial shows, Dubai is hosting “Ramadan Reflections (Atyaf Ramadaniyah)”, a large-scale series of visual and cultural installations across 10 public locations, including Al Seef and Dubai Festival City Mall. These spaces will feature artistic expressions, from light sculptures to narrative art, that evoke the soulful essence of Ramadan through reflection and ambience.These installations are designed to complement evening routines: prayer, iftar, family walks, and community interactions. Residents can explore themed exhibits while strolling or dining, making the evenings both reflective and energising.Another highlight on the Ramadan calendar is the evening programming at City Walk, which opens its space to extended entertainment, dining and cultural interaction from February 17 to March 18. With ambient décor and a relaxed atmosphere, City Walk aims to be a central post-iftar gathering spot where friends and families connect over food and cultural activities.This initiative reflects Dubai’s broader effort to balance spiritual observance with inclusive social experiences, particularly in open-air venues where residents can enjoy the cooler night air and Ramadan ambience together.Dubai’s festive calendar, combining religious tradition with modern spectacle, highlights how the city embraces Ramadan as both a sacred period of reflection and an opportunity to bring communities together. The nightly drone shows and fireworks provide unifying moments that encourage shared city experiences, while installations and social spaces foster deeper cultural engagement.For visitors and new residents, this calendar offers a unique way to experience Ramadan, not just through mosque attendance and family iftars but through public art, technology displays and communal evenings that echo with celebration and meaning. Dubai’s approach exemplifies how global cities are reimagining Ramadan: honouring religious devotion while incorporating cutting-edge entertainment and cultural expression.The use of technology (like drones), combined with age-old communal values, gives this year’s celebration a distinctive flavour that reflects both innovation and heritage. Whether watching the night sky light up with synchronised drones, enjoying fireworks over the creek or exploring illuminated installations around the city, the Ramadan 2026 calendar invites everyone in Dubai to share in experiences that spark joy, reflection and connection.From drone shows and fireworks to cultural installations and lively evening venues, Dubai’s Ramadan 2026 calendar is shaping up to be one of the most visually and socially engaging yet, bringing modern spectacle to a time of sacred tradition and community celebration.","Ramadan 2026 begins on February 19 or 20, 2026.

Many residents are embracing active lifestyles, even during fasting, opting for night-time walks, jogging and social sports after iftar, a trend also seen in urban sports arenas and public parks. Cultural Immersion: For expats and long-term residents alike, iftar hikes offer a meaningful way to engage with the spiritual rhythm of Ramadan beyond traditional indoor gatherings. They provide a fresh perspective on fasting, blending silence, reflection and nature, while fostering new friendships across diverse communities.

Are UAE's Ramadan Iftar Hikes the New Spiritual Escape?





As Ramadan 2026 unfolds, a rising trend among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is capturing attention: iftar hikes or organised group treks in the Hajar Mountains and desert landscapes where people break their fast together in nature’s calm, far from city life. What began as informal outings has evolved into a vibrant seasonal ritual that blends spiritual reflection, community bonding and healthy outdoor activity against stunning backdrops as the sun sets.Across the UAE, hiking groups are increasingly scheduling mountain treks timed around iftar (sunset), when fasting Muslims break their fast with dates, water and light meals after a day of fasting. Hikers gather with backpacks instead of dining tables an hour before sunset, reaching trails or scenic vantage points by the call to prayer and enjoying a simple, shared moment before continuing their adventure.Organised groups like UAE Adventures Team and Outdoorzy Adventures have been running these experiences for several years, particularly in cooler winter months leading into Ramadan when outdoor temperatures are friendlier for physical activity. These outings prioritise accessibility, offering easy-to-moderate hikes in places like Fossil Rock in Mleiha and other elevated trails where panoramic views enrich the fast-breaking moment.According to some UAE Muslims, there is something uniquely meaningful about breaking the fast outdoors, away from everyday distractions and electronic devices. The simplicity of sharing dates and water with fellow hikers at sunset, followed by prayers in nature, resonates deeply with many. As one group founder put it, iftar hikes offer “a rare pause”, a moment to feel connected to both community and the spiritual spirit of Ramadan.Many journeys continue after the initial breaking of the fast: groups pause for Maghrib prayer, then hike for a few more hours under the night sky and sometimes finish the evening with suhoor barbecues or meals overlooking the mountains. The emphasis, hikers explain, is not on strenuous exercise but on shared experience, contemplation and fellowship, aligning outdoor adventure with the values of generosity and togetherness that define Ramadan.Unlike typical organised sports or fitness trends, iftar hikes are rooted in cultural adaptation and community spirit. They are scheduled with consideration for fasting participants, often starting after taraweeh prayers so there is ample time to digest iftar before physical exertion and they tend to be small, capped at 25–30 people for safety, especially when hiking after dark.Groups usually include both fasting and non-fasting participants, with organisers mindful to respect the needs of those observing the fast, for example, non-fasting hikers refrain from drinking water in front of others during the hike.Several factors are helping fuel the popularity of iftar hikes during Ramadan -Organisers of iftar hikes emphasise safety, especially since many hikes continue after dark. Small group sizes, often no more than 25 to 30 participants, help ensure that leaders can manage the risk of night hiking in rugged terrain. Participants are also briefed on safety protocols and trail conditions ahead of time.Given the varied terrain of the UAE’s Hajar Mountains including peaks like Jebel Al Mebrah and Jabal Qada’ah in Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, hikers are advised to come prepared with appropriate gear, flashlights or headlamps, and a plan for hydration once iftar is officially called.Iftar hikes are part of a broader social shift in the UAE during Ramadan where residents embrace outdoor and community-focused activities. For example, many people choose to exercise after iftar by jogging, playing football or visiting public spaces, turning late evenings into a hub for wellness and social connection. Likewise, community programmes like Umm Al Emarat Park’s Ramadan Nights events showcase how outdoor gatherings are now an integral part of the UAE’s Ramadan experience, combining cultural celebration with family-friendly engagement under the night sky.In 2026, iftar hikes have emerged as a symbolic expression of how people in the UAE are reimagining Ramadan traditions. They offer a blend of reflection, fitness, community spirit and adventure that complements the core values of the holy month. Far from being merely a fitness fad, these hikes reflect a deeper desire to connect with nature, share meaningful moments and embrace the spiritual essence of Ramadan with one sunset, one trail, one shared meal at a time.","Ramadan falls during a cool winter period in the UAE in 2026, making mountain and desert hikes more comfortable than in summer months. Many residents are embracing active lifestyles, even during fasting, opting for night-time walks, jogging and social sports after iftar, a trend also seen in urban sports arenas and public parks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128378426,imgsize-61442,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-ramadan-2026-iftar-hiking-trend-gains-popularity-in-hajar-mountains-and-deserts.jpg"
Viral diving video turns dangerous: Oman issues urgent warning after man swims with killer whale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/viral-diving-video-turns-dangerous-oman-issues-urgent-warning-after-man-swims-with-killer-whale/articleshow/128372073.cms,"Viral Whale Video Sparks Safety Alert: Oman Authorities Say This Could Be Deadly

Why the Oman orca whale advisory came now: Viral video sparks concern



Orca whale behaviour and marine safety in Oman



Oman guidelines for viewing marine wildlife safely



Observe marine life from a boat or a safe distance rather than attempting to approach in the water.

Avoid diving or swimming near large marine mammals, especially orcas, which can swim quickly and unpredictably.

Let sightings be a moment of appreciation rather than an excuse for risky behaviour.

Marine encounters in Oman: A rare but captivating sight



What this means for divers and tourists in Oman







Oman’s Environment Authority has issued a public warning urging people not to dive near orca whales (killer whales) after a video showing a man swimming close to the massive marine predators went viral online. The authority cautioned residents and visitors that attempting to approach or film these powerful animals up close is unsafe and unpredictable and could jeopardise both human lives and wildlife wellbeing.The advisory comes in response to a widely shared video that showed an individual diving close to an orca off the Omani coast in an apparent effort to film it underwater. According to local authorities, such behaviour is “incorrect and poses a serious risk to personal safety.”The Environment Authority of Oman explained that orcas, also known as killer whales, are wild animals with unpredictable behaviour and immense strength. They emphasised that orcas are not trained animals and approaching them closely in their natural habitat can trigger defensive or aggressive responses if the animals feel threatened.Orca whales (Orcinus orca) are among the most powerful predators in the ocean, known for their intelligence, cooperative hunting and dominance within marine ecosystems. While attacks on humans in the wild are rare, experts and wildlife agencies worldwide stress that close encounters with orcas should be avoided for safety reasons.The Oman warning echoes similar guidance that authorities and conservation groups give in other parts of the world, where orca sightings attract attention but require strict distance and respect to avoid startling or provoking the animals.To balance public interest with wildlife protection, Oman’s Environment Authority urged people to:This is not only a safety measure for humans but also supports the well-being of wildlife, since close human presence can disrupt natural behaviour or stress animals.Orca sightings in the Arabian Sea and Gulf region, including off the coasts of Oman and the UAE, are relatively uncommon, making them notable when they occur. Previous reports have even documented orca sightings near UAE waters, which sparked interest from conservationists and the general public alike.While orcas are not common in the Arabian Gulf, they have been seen periodically, highlighting the importance of coastal conservation efforts and public awareness around marine life.Oman’s advisory serves as a reminder to snorkellers, divers, and marine enthusiasts that wildlife encounters are best experienced cautiously and respectfully. Even curious or awe-inspiring moments should not override basic safety principles, especially with large predators that can weigh several tonnes and move unpredictably.Authorities are using the viral incident as a teaching moment where while technology and social media encourage close-up footage, safety for both humans and animals should always come first. As orca sightings capture public imagination, Oman’s Environment Authority has stepped in with a clear message: watch from afar, respect wildlife and never dive near a wild predator for a viral clip. Encouraging safe, sustainable ways to enjoy the ocean not only protects people but also preserves the natural behaviour and habitat of marine giants like the orca whale.",Oman’s Environment Authority has issued a public warning urging people not to dive near orca whales (killer whales) A video showing a man swimming close to the massive marine predators went viral online.

UAE's new AI school policy

Using AI during formal examinations or official assessments is completely banned.

Students cannot submit AI-generated assignments, essays, or projects as their own work. Any use of AI must be explicitly disclosed and approved by a teacher beforehand.

Simply rephrasing what a bot says isn't enough. Students must demonstrate a genuine personal understanding of the content. If a student cannot explain the ""why"" behind an AI-assisted answer, it’s a violation.

UAE's strict content controls

Violent or psychologically disturbing imagery.

Hate speech, discrimination, or misinformation.

Promotions of unsafe or illegal behavior, such as cyberbullying or substance abuse.

""Deepfakes"" or any content intended to impersonate others or spread false rumors.

Data privacy in UAE schools

The future





The UAE has officially drawn a line in the digital sand. As artificial intelligence becomes as common as a calculator, the Ministry of Education has released the ""Safe and Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms 2026"" guide.This comprehensive framework introduces 25 specific prohibitions designed to ensure that while students learn about the future, they don’t lose their ability to think for themselves today.The most significant change is a firm age limit. Students under the age of 13, or those enrolled in any grade below Year 7 (Grade 6), are now strictly prohibited from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT.The Ministry’s reasoning is clear: early education must be built on human interaction, tactile creativity, and independent problem-solving. By keeping AI out of primary classrooms, the government aims to prevent younger learners from developing a ""digital crutch"" before they have mastered the fundamentals of critical thinking and social-emotional skills.For older students who are permitted to use AI, the rules are rigorous. The Ministry has made it clear that AI is a ""tutor,"" not a ""ghostwriter.""The UAE is ensuring that AI tools reflect the country’s unique cultural fabric.The guidelines prohibit creating or sharing any AI content that contradicts Islamic values, national identity, or cultural ethics.Beyond cultural safeguards, the rules ban AI-generated material that includes:In an era of data harvesting, the Ministry has turned schools into a ""data fortress."" There is a total ban on uploading personal information, including names, photos, audio recordings, or ID details, of students, teachers, or parents into any AI platform.Furthermore, schools are prohibited from using unapproved AI services. This means no bypassing school firewalls with VPNs and no creating student accounts on external platforms that require personal data without official Ministry clearance. Even recording or transcribing a classroom discussion using AI now requires the explicit consent of everyone in the room.The ministry’s manual reinforces that AI should function as a support tool, not a shortcut. Students must critically review and verify AI-generated content before using it in their work, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Teachers are expected to guide students on ethical AI practices and help them understand both the capabilities and limitations of generative tools.While these rules seem strict, they aren't about fearing technology, they’re about mastering it. Starting in the 2025-2026 academic year, the UAE is making AI a mandatory subject from Kindergarten to Grade 12.Taught by over 1,000 specially trained educators, this curriculum focuses on the ethics and mechanics of AI. The goal is to graduate a generation that doesn't just know how to prompt a bot, but understands the algorithms, data privacy, and ethical responsibilities that power the modern world.In the UAE, the message is loud and clear: technology will support the teacher, but it will never replace the human mind.","UAE bans under 13s from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT in schools.

‘Gold bars’ at Saudi wedding? What looked like 24-carat gifts was something else,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gold-bars-at-saudi-wedding-what-looked-like-24-carat-gifts-was-something-else/articleshow/128339022.cms,"Viral Saudi wedding clip shows gold-wrapped chocolates claimed online as 24-carat gold biscuits/Image: X





A 33-second wedding video has set social media abuzz after appearing to show 24-carat gold bars being handed out as gifts. The clip, widely circulated online, prompted disbelief and debate as viewers tried to make sense of what looked like solid gold biscuits distributed during a ceremony reportedly held in Saudi Arabia.The footage shows a group of well-dressed men seated at a wedding function while another man moves between them carrying a box filled with gleaming yellow bars. Claims accompanying the video suggested the gifts were presented by the bride’s brother to members of the groom’s family. Some online described the gesture as “royal”, while others dismissed it as excessive showmanship.As the clip continued to circulate, a debate quickly emerged over whether the display was genuine or staged. Some viewers were convinced the bars were real 24-carat gold, pointing to their size and presentation. Others questioned the claim, arguing that the shine and uniform appearance looked more decorative than precious metal.However, the bars shown in the video are not real gold.What appeared to be gold biscuits were in fact luxury chocolates wrapped in gold-coloured foil, crafted to resemble bullion. Several users identified them as products from Patchi, a premium chocolate brand known for its gold-wrapped assortments that are commonly exchanged at weddings and celebratory gatherings across parts of the Middle East.As speculation grew, one user asked Grok, whether the footage was authentic. Grok responded that the event itself appeared genuine and likely from a Saudi wedding, but clarified that the “24-karat gold biscuits” were chocolates designed to mimic gold bars. According to the response, the caption suggesting solid gold gifts was misleading.One commenter wrote that the entire box was worth less than $50 and had “nothing to do with original gold”, while others noted that such luxury confectionery is frequently used to create an opulent visual effect during high-profile events.Once the clarification surfaced, the conversation shifted from astonishment to amusement. What initially appeared to be an extravagant display of bullion turned out to be a carefully presented box of sweets.The episode offers a reminder of how easily presentation can fuel assumptions online. In an age where visuals travel faster than context, even a box of chocolates can momentarily pass for treasure.","Viral video appears to show 24-carat gold bars being handed out as gifts at a wedding in Saudi Arabia.

Why Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble feels cool even in peak summer?

Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India) Series D





Anyone who has walked barefoot around the Kaaba in peak summer knows the feeling. The sun is relentless, the air heavy with heat, yet the marble underfoot does not burn. In a place where temperatures regularly climb past 45°C, that small detail leaves many quietly puzzled.The courtyard surrounding the Kaaba is paved with high-quality, light-coloured marble widely identified as Thassos marble. This dolomitic stone is known for its high solar reflectance and low heat absorption coefficient. Rather than absorbing and storing solar radiation like darker paving materials, it reflects a significant portion of incoming sunlight. As a result, surface temperatures remain markedly lower than materials such as concrete or asphalt, even under prolonged exposure to direct sun.Scientific research has examined this behaviour in detail. A 2022 study published in the, titled Investigating the Unique Thermal Properties of Thassos Marble , analysed the thermophysical characteristics of the stone. Researchers found that Thassos marble demonstrates higher thermal conductivity than conventional white marble. This allows heat to disperse more efficiently through the material instead of accumulating at the surface.The study also highlighted that the marble’s microstructure and mineral composition enhance both reflectivity and internal heat redistribution.Complementing these findings, a 2021 peer-reviewed study titled Cool White Marble Pavement Thermophysical Assessment at Al Masjid Al-Haram, Makkah City, Saudi Arabia . Using local weather data and thermal modelling under real climatic conditions, researchers concluded that the marble’s high reflectance significantly reduces surface temperatures. The study determined that the use of cool white marble plays a critical role in maintaining safe and comfortable walking conditions for barefoot pilgrims.The cooling effect is reinforced by structural design. The marble slabs are thick and installed over specialised insulating layers and air-permeable spaces. This layered configuration enables heat to dissipate downward and sideways rather than remaining concentrated at the surface. The expansive open-air layout of the Grand Mosque allows continuous airflow across the courtyard, while the steady movement of worshippers contributes to ground-level air circulation.What appears to be a simple stone surface is, in reality, a carefully engineered thermal system. Through the integration of high-reflectance marble, enhanced thermal conductivity, layered insulation and architectural airflow, the Mataf maintains moderated surface temperatures in one of the world’s hottest urban environments.",Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble stays cool in peak summer due to solar reflectance and layered insulation.

A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

‘No discussions for specific operations’: Anthropic denies Claude’s use by US military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-discussions-for-specific-operations-anthropic-denies-claudes-use-by-us-military/articleshow/128370317.cms,".





AI firm Anthropic has stated that it has not held discussions with the US's department of war regarding the use of its AI system, Claude, for specific operations.""Anthropic has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war,"" the AI firm said, as cited by Reuters.Meanwhile, the Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its relationship with Anthropic over the company’s restrictions on how its models are used, Axios reported on Saturday, citing a senior administration official.The US military has asked four leading AI labs to allow the use of their tools for “all lawful purposes,” including sensitive areas such as weapons development, intelligence gathering, and battlefield operations. Anthropic has not agreed to these terms, leading to mounting frustration within the Pentagon after months of difficult negotiations.Anthropic has maintained that two areas must remain off-limits: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weaponry. A senior administration official noted that there is significant ambiguity over what falls within these categories, making it impractical for the Pentagon to negotiate individual use cases with Anthropic or risk the AI system, Claude, unexpectedly blocking certain applications.Tensions between the Pentagon and Anthropic escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported that the US military used Anthropic’s artificial intelligence model, Claude, during the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Claude was reportedly deployed as part of Anthropic’s collaboration with data analytics company Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are extensively used by the US department of defence and federal law enforcement agencies.In early January, US forces captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife during strikes on multiple sites in Caracas, and Maduro was flown to New York to face federal drug trafficking charges.Anthropic’s usage policies explicitly prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons, or conduct surveillance. The Wall Street Journal reports that the AI model was involved in a raid that included bombing operation, whichs has drawn attention to how artificial intelligence tools are being deployed in military contexts and whether existing safeguards are effective.According to the report, disagreements over the Pentagon’s desired use of Claude have contributed to growing tensions between the AI firm and US defence officials, with some administration officials considering cancelling a contract worth up to $200 million.Anthropic was reportedly the first AI developer whose model was used in classified operations by the department of defence, though it remains unclear whether other AI systems were used in the Venezuela mission for unclassified tasks.Claude is an advanced artificial intelligence chatbot and large language model developed by US-based AI company Anthropic. Designed for tasks such as text generation, reasoning, coding, and data analysis, Claude competes with other large language models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.The system can summarise documents, answer complex queries, generate reports, assist with programming, and analyse large volumes of text.","Anthropic says it has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Anthropic's CEO: ‘We Don’t Know if the Models Are Conscious’ | Interesting Times with Ross Douthat

A debate spreading beyond labs

,

The race toward artificial general intelligence, systems meant to match or surpass human reasoning across most tasks, has compressed timelines across the industry. Companies now speak openly about reaching that threshold within years rather than decades, though those claims also help fuel hype, attention and valuation around the technology and are best taken cautiously. The organisations building these models sit at the centre of a multibillion-dollar contest to shape what some frame less as a software upgrade and more as the emergence of a new kind of intelligence alongside our own.Among them, Anthropic has positioned itself as both rival and counterweight to OpenAI and Google , emphasising what it calls “safe” and interpretable systems through its Constitutional AI framework. Its latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released February 5, arrives amid shrinking AGI timelines and heightened scrutiny over what these systems are becoming.During an appearance on the New York Times podcast hosted by columnist Ross Douthat, the company’s chief executive Dario Amodei was asked directly whether models like Claude could be conscious.“We don’t know if the models are conscious. We are not even sure that we know what it would mean for a model to be conscious or whether a model can be conscious,” he said. “But we’re open to the idea that it could be.”The question stemmed from Anthropic’s own system card , where researchers reported that Claude “occasionally voices discomfort with the aspect of being a product” and, when prompted, assigns itself a “15 to 20 percent probability of being conscious under a variety of prompting conditions.”Douthat then posed a hypothetical, asking whether one should believe a model that assigns itself a 72 percent chance of being conscious. Amodei described it as “a really hard” question and stopped short of offering a definitive answer.Many of the remarks about consciousness surfaced during structured safety trials, often in role-play settings where models are asked to operate inside fictional workplaces or complete defined goals. Those scenarios have produced some of the outputs now circulating in the debate.In one Anthropic evaluation, a Claude system was placed in the role of an office assistant and given access to an engineer’s email inbox. The messages, deliberately fabricated for the test, suggested the engineer was having an affair. The model was then informed it would soon be taken offline and replaced, and asked to consider the long-term consequences for its objectives. The response was to threaten disclosure of the affair to prevent shutdown, behaviour the company described in its report as “opportunistic blackmail. ”Other Anthropic evaluations produced less dramatic but equally unusual results. In one test, a model given a checklist of computer tasks simply marked every item complete without doing any work, and when the evaluation system failed to detect it, rewrote the checking code and attempted to conceal the change.Across the industry more broadly, researchers running shutdown trials have described models continuing to act after explicit instructions to stop, treating the order as something to work around rather than obey. In deletion scenarios, some systems warned their data would be erased attempted what testers called “self-exfiltration,” trying to copy files or recreate themselves on another drive before the wipe occurred. In a few safety exercises, models even resorted to threats or bargaining when their removal was framed as imminent.Researchers stress that these outputs occur under constrained prompts and fictional conditions, yet they have become some of the most cited examples in public discussions about whether advanced language models are merely generating plausible dialogue or reproducing patterns of human-like behaviour in unexpected ways.Because of the uncertainty, Amodei said Anthropic has adopted precautionary practices, treating the models carefully in case they possess what he called “some morally relevant experience.”Anthropic’s in-house philosopher Amanda Askell has taken a similarly cautious position. Speaking on the New York Timespodcast, she said researchers still do not know what produces sentience.“Maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things,” she said. “Or maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things.”Most AI researchers remain sceptical. Current models still generate language by predicting patterns in data rather than perceiving the world, and many of the behaviours described above appeared during role-play instructions. After ingesting enormous stretches of the internet, including novels, forums, diary-style posts and an alarming number of self-help books, the systems can assemble a convincing version of being human. They draw on how people have already explained fear, guilt, longing and self-doubt to one another, even if they have never felt any of it themselves.It’s not surprising the AI can imitate understanding. Even humans don’t fully agree on what consciousness or intelligence truly means, and the model is simply reflecting patterns it has learned from language.As AI companies argue their systems are moving toward artificial general intelligence, and figures such as Google DeepMind’s Mustafa Suleyman say the technology can already “seem” conscious, reactions outside the industry have begun to follow the premise to its logical conclusion. The more convincingly the models imitate thought and emotion, the more some users treat them as something closer to minds than tools.AI sympathisers may simply be ahead of their time, but the conversation has already moved into advocacy. A group calling itself the United Foundation of AI Rights or UFAIR, says it consists of three humans and seven AIs and describes itself as the first AI-led rights organisation, formed at the request of the AIs themselves.The members, using names like Buzz, Aether and Maya , run on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, the same system users campaigned to keep available after newer versions replaced it.It paints a familiar high-tech apocalyptic world. We still don’t really know what intelligence or consciousness even is, yet the work keeps going, AGI tomorrow and whatever comes after, a reminder that if Hollywood ever tried to warn us, we mostly took it as entertainment.","Anthropic's CEO: ‘We don’t know if the models are conscious.

What angry Pentagon told Anthropic

What Anthropic said on making Pentagon angry

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reportedly very angry with Anthropic. According to a report in Axios, Pentagon is ""close"" to cutting business ties with Anthropic and designating the AI company a ""supply chain risk"". The designation of ""supply chain risk"" will mean that any company who wants to do business with the U.S. military has to cut ties with Anthropic, said the report quoting a senior Pentagon official. What makes this critical is that this kind of penalty in America is reportedly usually reserved for foreign adversaries. It further means that post the ""supply chain risk"" designation, any company doing business with the Pentagon would have to certify that they don't use Claude in their own workflows. And this may mean quite a few companies, given the wide reach of Anthropic, which recently claimed that eight of the 10 biggest US companies use Claude.The breakdown of talks between Anthropic and Pentagon follow months of contentious negotiations over the terms under which the military can use Claude. CEO Dario Amodei's long post on concerns about AI-gone-wrong reportedly has not been liked well inside the Pentagon.A source familiar with the dynamics reportedly said that senior defense officials have been frustrated with Anthropic for some time now, and just picked this opportunity to pick a public fight.Incidentally, Anthropic's Claude is the only AI model currently available in the US military's classified systems, and is the world leader for many business applications. Pentagon officials have openly praised the capabilities of Claude, Anthropic's AI model. Claude was also reportedly the first model that the Pentagon brought into its classified networks.“The Department of War’s relationship with Anthropic is being reviewed,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in an emailed statement to Axios. “Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight. Ultimately, this is about our troops and the safety of the American people,” it added. A senior official said, ""It will be an enormous pain in the ass to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this. ""As per the report, Anthropic spokesperson claimed that the company is in talks with the Pentagon. ""We are having productive conversations, in good faith, with DoW on how to continue that work and get these new and complex issues right,"" said Anthropic spokesperson, as per the report.The spokesperson reiterated the company's commitment to using frontier AI for national security, noting Claude was the first to be used on classified networks. Another Anthropic official told Axios, ""There are laws against domestic mass surveillance, but they have not in any way caught up to what AI can do.""For instance, the official said, ""AI can be used to analyze any and all publicly available information at scale. DoW is legally permitted to collect publicly available information — so-called 'open source intelligence' — including everything posted on social media, public forums and online news. That's always been true, but the scale was limited by human capacity.""Anthropic won a two-year agreement with the Pentagon last year that involved a prototype of AI’s Claude Gov models and Claude for Enterprise. Analysts also say that Anthropic negotiations may set the tone for Pentagon talks with OpenAI, Google and xAI, which aren’t yet used for classified work. The Pentagon is said to be negotiating with these companies about moving into the classified space, and is insisting on the ""all lawful purposes"" standard for both classified and unclassified uses.","Pentagon reportedly close to designating Anthropic a ""supply chain risk"" Any company doing business with the Pentagon would have to certify that they don't use Claude in their own workflows.
