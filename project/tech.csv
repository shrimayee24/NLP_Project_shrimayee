I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy.

Communication features disabled in Saudi Arabia and UAE

“The safety and well-being of children online is a top priority... We will continue to work together to ensure a safe, trusted, and positive digital environment for all UAE users, especially children.”

Regional bans and content moderation efforts

Kuwait’s ban was announced on August 21, 2025, following community complaints.



Qatar restricted access on August 13, although the government has not publicly commented.



Turkey blocked the platform on August 7, with Roblox stating it is cooperating with authorities.



Oman and Jordan imposed earlier restrictions, and the game is currently restricted in various degrees across countries like Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Yemen.





“As part of this vision, and in view of recent discussions with regulatory authorities in a number of countries across the Middle East, we are committing to enhance our Arabic communication and content moderation capabilities.”





Guardian investigation reveals serious safety lapses

Voice and text chat features were accessible even to users listed as under 13, due to easily bypassed age verification mechanisms.



Test avatars registered as children accessed sexually suggestive environments, including virtual hotel rooms, fetish accessories, and public bathrooms that enabled inappropriate roleplay.



Audio from voice chat included explicit sounds like kissing, grunting, and slurping, which the platform’s real-time AI moderation failed to filter.



In one case, an adult avatar was able to solicit Snapchat details from a five-year-old avatar using barely disguised language.





“There are bad actors on the internet... this is an issue that goes beyond Roblox and needs to be addressed through collaboration with governments and an industry-wide commitment to strong safety measures.”

Wider backlash and company response

Launching content tags



Updating parental tools



Increasing in-game moderation staff



Rolling out region-specific language moderation, especially in Arabic-speaking regions





“Our vision is to connect people with optimism and civility... by creating a platform where users of all ages can have a safe, civil and positive experience.”





Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, following mounting regional and global scrutiny over child safety. The move, which affects millions of young users in the Middle East ’s largest gaming markets, comes after discussions with government regulators and follows similar actions in other countries across the region.Roblox, the widely used online gaming and creation platform, has halted all in-experience communication features—including voice and text chat, for users in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The decision was made following talks with regulatory bodies in both nations and is part of a broader push to bolster digital child safety.In Saudi Arabia, the changes were coordinated with the General Authority for Media Regulation, which emphasized its role in protecting the public from the adverse effects of electronic games. According to the regulator, this measure aims to prevent exposure to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and potential online predatory behavior.Meanwhile, in the UAE, the move followed discussions between Roblox and the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). In a joint statement, the TDRA and Roblox said:Both countries have implemented the restrictions effective immediately.Roblox also committed to enhancing its Arabic-language content and introducing stronger moderation tools, including content filters and improved parental controls.The action in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is part of a wider wave of regulatory crackdowns across the Middle East. Several countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Oman, Jordan, and others, have already blocked access to Roblox entirely in response to escalating concerns over child safety.Roblox remains accessible in Saudi Arabia, which is considered one of the largest emerging gaming markets in the region. However, the suspension of chat functions marks a significant shift in how the platform is being regulated there.Roblox has stated:A key driver of these policy shifts was an investigation by The Guardian and UK-based research agency Revealing Reality, which exposed critical failures in Roblox’s safety systems, particularly its chat features. The report documented how children as young as five were able to interact with adults inside the platform’s games, often without any effective moderation.Key findings from the investigation include:The researchers concluded that while Roblox advertises itself as a “child-friendly” platform, its safety features are limited in their effectiveness, and the actual in-game experience often contradicts that appearance.In response, Roblox acknowledged:The company also admitted that age verification for under-13 users continues to be an industry-wide challenge.Beyond the Middle East, Roblox has faced increasing legal and public pressure to improve safety controls. In August 2025, Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, accusing it of facilitating the systemic sexual exploitation and abuse of children in the United States.The company has also drawn backlash for banning content creators like Schlep, a vigilante YouTuber known for acting as a self-proclaimed “predator hunter” within the game. Schlep claims to have contributed to the arrest of six suspected predators before being banned by Roblox for violating community guidelines.Roblox has responded with a series of measures:The company reiterated its long-term goal:Despite these efforts, confidence among parents, regulators, and users remains shaken. The recent steps in the UAE and Saudi Arabia mark a turning point in the platform’s ongoing struggle to reconcile its popularity with its responsibility to protect young users.",Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The move comes after discussions with government regulators and follows similar actions in other countries across the region. Roblox also committed to enhancing its Arabic-language content and introducing stronger moderation tools.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123702541,imgsize-1912491,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-saudi-arabia-roblox-ban.jpg"
Dead Sea mystery: Strange 'salt snow' could explain hidden structures below,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/dead-sea-mystery-strange-salt-snow-could-explain-hidden-structures-below/articleshow/123678887.cms,"

What is ‘ salt snow ’ of Dead Sea

How the Dead Sea became a natural laboratory



Salt giants beneath the surface



Climate change and its role



Why it matters globally





In one of the most unusual natural discoveries of recent years, scientists have observed what they call “salt snow” falling beneath the surface of the Dead Sea. Unlike normal snowfall, this strange process happens underwater as halite crystals form and descend like snowflakes. Researchers believe this rare phenomenon may help explain how massive underground salt structures such as chimneys, domes, and kilometer-thick deposits are created. Triggered by climate change, evaporation, and water diversion, the “salt snow” not only reshapes the Dead Sea but also offers clues to Earth’s geological past.Salt snow refers to the precipitation of halite crystals within the Dead Sea. Normally, salt crystallization is seen in shallow or cold water layers, but here it occurs year-round, even during summer. The process begins when surface water becomes warmer and saltier due to evaporation. This dense water cools and sinks, while colder, less salty water from below rises. The mixing of these layers triggers crystal formation in mid-water zones, creating the illusion of snow falling underwater.The Dead Sea is the lowest point on Earth’s surface and one of the saltiest water bodies in the world, making it uniquely suited for such phenomena.Historically, its water remained layered and stable. But since the 1980s, reduced inflow from the Jordan River and intensified evaporation have disrupted this balance. As a result, annual mixing of water layers now fuels continuous salt crystallization. Unlike other seas such as the Red Sea or the Mediterranean, where similar processes ended millions of years ago, the Dead Sea remains active, offering a living glimpse into Earth’s geological history.These falling crystals accumulate over time, forming vast salt structures beneath the seabed. Known as salt giants, chimneys, and domes, they can reach more than a kilometer in thickness and extend over vast distances. Such formations are crucial for geologists because they mirror conditions during the Messinian Salinity Crisis over 5 million years ago, when the Mediterranean dried up and massive salt deposits were left behind. The Dead Sea now serves as a smaller-scale model of that ancient process.The salt snow is not just a scientific curiosity, it reflects wider environmental shifts. Climate change, combined with human-driven freshwater diversion, has caused the Dead Sea’s water level to drop by about one meter per year. This accelerates salinity increases and alters stratification, intensifying salt precipitation. The unusual “snowfall” thus acts as a visible marker of climate stress on fragile ecosystems, highlighting how human activities and warming temperatures reshape natural processes.Understanding the Dead Sea’s salt snow provides more than local insights. These formations record climate fluctuations and hydrological imbalances, offering a geological archive of environmental change. On a broader scale, studying this phenomenon could shed light on how coastal systems respond to rising salinity and climate change worldwide. It also informs research into erosion, resource extraction, and the stability of other saltwater basins. Scientists believe the lessons from the Dead Sea could also apply to other extreme environments, including ancient Martian lakes. The discovery underscores how even the harshest ecosystems can hold keys to unlocking planetary history.","Scientists have observed ‘salt snow’ falling beneath the surface of the Dead Sea.

Stone Age underwater city: A window into prehistoric life

Broader research and scientific significance





Archaeologists have uncovered a remarkably well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast. Dubbed the “Stone Age Atlantis,” the site went underwater as massive ice sheets melted at the end of the last Ice Age, raising sea levels and flooding coastal communities. Preserved in an oxygen-free underwater environment, the settlement has effectively become a “time capsule,” halting decomposition and providing unprecedented insight into early human life. Artefacts, including wooden tools, arrowheads, animal bones, hazelnuts, and seal teeth, reveal a thriving Mesolithic society skilled in fishing, hunting, and crafting tools.The settlement offers a rare glimpse into Mesolithic life. Archaeologists have excavated about 430 square feet at a depth of 26 feet, uncovering evidence of organised human activity. Wooden tools, stone implements, and food remnants, such as hazelnuts, indicate a society that relied on fishing, hunting, and gathering. The site’s preservation provides valuable information on how early humans adapted to environmental changes, particularly rising sea levels that transformed coastlines and habitats.This preservation makes it one of the most significant Mesolithic discoveries in Northern Europe to date.Researchers employed specialised underwater technologies, including vacuum systems, to safely recover artefacts without damaging them. The oxygen-free conditions preserved both organic and inorganic materials, allowing archaeologists to study Mesolithic tools, structures, and dietary remains in remarkable detail. Experts describe the site as a “time capsule,” where everything feels as though time has stopped, offering unique insights into prehistoric human life.This discovery is part of a six-year, €15.5 million European Union-funded project mapping submerged prehistoric landscapes across the North and Baltic Seas. Scientists aim to reconstruct coastal human activity, subsistence strategies, and adaptation to climate change during the post-Ice Age period. The Aarhus site complements other submerged settlements, including locations near Alexandria, Egypt, and lakes in North America, shedding light on how ancient civilisations responded to rising waters and changing environments. Researchers believe such underwater finds may also help refine climate models by providing concrete data on past sea-level rise. The artefacts offer a fascinating glimpse into everyday life in the Stone Age. They also highlight the skill and ingenuity of early humans in using available resources.Stone Age Atlantis demonstrates how early humans thrived despite environmental challenges. Artefacts such as fishing tools, seal remains, and arrowheads highlight their ingenuity, while the preserved settlement layout suggests organised community life. Beyond archaeology, the site offers valuable lessons for modern societies on climate resilience, illustrating how humans have historically adapted to rising sea levels—insights that remain highly relevant today. The Stone Age Atlantis discovery not only enriches our understanding of prehistoric human ingenuity but also underscores the enduring importance of studying ancient responses to environmental change.","Archaeologists have uncovered a remarkably well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast.

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

"Europe bets on Supercomputer Jupiter to takes on China and the US in AI, and do what it has 'NEVER' been able to do so far",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europe-bets-on-supercomputer-jupiter-to-takes-on-china-and-the-us-in-ai-and-do-what-it-has-never-been-able-to-do-so-far/articleshow/123738558.cms,"What is the Jupiter Supercomputer



Apps of Supercomputer Jupiter

It will not be really an exaggeration to say that Europe has been a laggard in technology. There are far and few European technology companies that have a global reach and recognition. It is no different in AI race, which too is dominated by American and Chinese companies. Europe now seems to be aiming to change this. As to how, with its new Supercomputer called Jupiter. The Jupiter supercomputer, Europe's fastest and first exascale system, was officially unveiled on June 5 in Germany. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that this new supercomputer could help Europe ""catch up and then keep pace"" with AI leaders like the United States and China.Experts see Jupiter as a significant step for Europe in the AI sector, where it has lagged behind the US and China. A recent Stanford University report revealed that in 2024, U.S. institutions produced 40 ""notable"" AI models, compared to 15 for China and just three for Europe.According to a report by news agency AFP, during the inauguration, Chancellor Merz acknowledged the ""neck-and-neck race"" between the U.S. and China for AI dominance. However, he emphasized that Europe can still make up ground, stressing the need for ""sovereign computing capacities"" as a matter of both economic competitiveness and national security.Jupiter was built by a consortium that includes the French tech giant Atos's subsidiary Eviden and the German group ParTec. Despite this, the system's reliance on U.S.-made Nvidia chips highlights Europe's continued dependence on American technology.Located at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre , Jupiter is claimed to be Europe's first ""exascale"" supercomputer, capable of performing at least one quintillion (one billion billion) calculations per second. The U.S. currently has three such computers.The system is housed in a 3,600-square-meter facility, roughly half the size of a football pitch, and contains about 24,000 Nvidia chips. The project's development and operational costs over the next few years, totaling 500 million euros ($580 million), are being jointly funded by the European Union and Germany.According to Thomas Lippert, head of the Juelich center, Jupiter is ""a leap forward in the performance of computing in Europe,"" being 20 times more powerful than any other computer in Germany. Its immense processing power will be accessible to researchers and companies across various fields, including training AI models.Beyond AI, Jupiter has a wide range of applications. Researchers plan to use it to create more accurate and long-term climate forecasts, which could help predict extreme weather events. While current models can simulate climate change over a decade, scientists believe Jupiter will enable them to forecast up to 30 years and possibly even up to 100 years.The supercomputer will also be used to realistically simulate brain processes for research into diseases like Alzheimer's and to optimize clean energy technologies, such as simulating air flows around wind turbines.Jupiter requires an estimated 11 megawatts of power, equivalent to the energy consumption of thousands of homes. However, its operators claim it is the most energy-efficient among the world's fastest computer systems, using advanced hardware and water-cooling systems. The waste heat generated by the computer will also be repurposed to heat nearby buildings.","Jupiter is Europe's first ""exascale"" supercomputer, capable of performing at least one quintillion (one billion billion) calculations per second.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Geoffrey Hinton , a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), has sounded an alarm about the technology’s potential for harm. The recent public frenzy over AI tools like ChatGPT has caused Hinton to shift from accelerating AI development to raising deep concerns about its future. He now believes that AI poses a grave threat to humanity, saying that the technology can help any person to create a nuclear bomb.Hinton described a chilling scenario where AI could enable an average person to create a bioweapon.“A normal person assisted by AI will soon be able to build bioweapons and that is terrible,” he said, adding, “Imagine if an average person in the street could make a nuclear bomb.”Hinton also discussed a range of topics, including the nuclear-level threats posed by AI, his own use of AI tools, and even how a chatbot played a role in his recent breakup.Recently, Hinton cautioned that AI could soon surpass human capabilities, including emotional manipulation. He suggested that AI's ability to learn from vast datasets enables it to influence human feelings and behaviours more effectively than humans.Hinton’s concern stems from his belief that AI is truly intelligent. He argued that, by any definition of the term, “AI is intelligent.” He used several analogies to explain that an AI's experience of reality is not so different from a human’s.“It seems very obvious to me. If you talk to these things and ask them questions, it understands,” Hinton explained.“There’s very little doubt in the technical community that these things will get smarter,” he added.However, not everyone agrees with Hinton's view. His former colleague and co-winner of the Turing Award , Yann LeCun , who is now the chief AI scientist at Meta , believes that large language models are limited and cannot meaningfully interact with the physical world.","Geoffrey Hinton, a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), has sounded an alarm about the technology’s potential for harm.
