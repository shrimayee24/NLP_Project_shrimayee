Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Who is Gabriella Zuniga? The OnlyFans star who sued Shannon Sharpe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-gabriella-zuniga-the-onlyfans-star-who-sued-shannon-sharpe/articleshow/120578272.cms,"Source - X

Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media, sparking debates, speculation, and a flurry of theories across every corner of the internet.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20. Her online presence was relatively low-key, but since the lawsuit went public, internet detectives have been digging into her digital footprint, resurfacing old posts, photos, and speculation about her connection to Sharpe well before the legal action began.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name. They’re keeping things very tight-lipped, likely to avoid adding more fuel to the already raging fire and giving the media even more to run with.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive and talked-about sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama, confusion, and nonstop speculation to an already chaotic, messy, and headline-dominating story that shows no signs of slowing down.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke.

Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Study links these 'Everywhere Chemicals' to thousands of global deaths from heart disease,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/study-links-these-everywhere-chemicals-to-thousands-of-global-deaths-from-heart-disease/articleshow/120742812.cms,"Minimizing Phthalate Exposure: Expert Advice

Simple tips to protect yourself from these Dangerous Chemicals



A groundbreaking new study has uncovered a potentially significant link between phthalates, synthetic chemicals prevalent in numerous consumer products, and mortality from heart disease. Researchers estimate that exposure to these ""everywhere chemicals,"" found in items ranging from food storage containers to cosmetics and children's toys, may have contributed to over 10% of all global heart disease deaths in 2018 among individuals aged 55 to 64.The study's senior author, Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, explained the mechanism behind this connection to CNN. ""Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,"" he stated. Dr. Trasande also directs NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and the Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.Prior research has already associated phthalate exposure with various health issues, including reproductive problems, such as genital malformations in male infants and reduced sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult men. Furthermore, studies have linked these chemicals to asthma, childhood obesity, and cancer.David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer advocacy organization focused on chemical exposure, commented on the new findings. In an email to CNN, he stated, ""The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks."" Andrews was not involved in the research.The American Chemistry Council, representing the industry, declined to offer specific comments on the study. However, they informed CNN via email about the High Phthalates Panel's dedication to promoting the benefits of certain high phthalates like DINP and DIDP.Phthalates are widely used to enhance the flexibility and durability of plastics found in PVC pipes, vinyl flooring, rainwear, medical tubing, garden hoses, and some children's toys. Additionally, they are commonly found in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture, and automotive plastics. These chemicals are also added to personal care products such as shampoo, soap, hair spray, and cosmetics to extend the longevity of fragrances.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, human exposure occurs primarily through inhalation of contaminated air and the ingestion of food and beverages that have come into contact with plastic containing phthalates.Health experts emphasize that individuals can take proactive steps to reduce their exposure to phthalates and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals.Dr. Trasande advised, ""Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with. Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.""* Opting for unscented lotions and laundry detergents.* Choosing cleaning supplies without added fragrances.* Using glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or wood containers for food storage and consumption.* Prioritizing fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables over canned and processed alternatives.* Practicing frequent handwashing to remove potential chemical residues.","Phthalates may have contributed to over 10% of all global heart disease deaths in 2018 among individuals aged 55 to 64.

Shaquille O'Neal once liked Teslas

Basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal has reportedly ended his love for Tesla ’s electric vehicles. The revelation came during a recent episode of “The Big Podcast” featuring comedian Karlous Miller, where the NBA Hall of Famer cited concerns over the vehicle's electric range as the primary reason for the switch.During the podcast, Shaq explained his reasoning, stating, ""I was into the Cyber Trucks, but they don’t get enough, I want to say what’s the word I’m looking for, electric mileage? Yeah, charger mileage.""According to O'Neal, the Cybertruck 's energy consumption (measured in kWh) did not provide sufficient travel distance, ultimately leading him to seek an alternative.He directly compared his experience with the Cybertruck with his recently-acquired Cadillac ESCALADE IQ . The celebrity revealed his new automotive preference, stating, “Then I just got one of those IQs system Escalade today, I was in Vegas, I ain’t have to charge up for four days.”“My cyber truck here if I go downtown to work tonight and come back, my gonna be struggling to get back.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Denver Broncos’ tight end concerns remain unresolved after 2025 NFL Draft despite signing Evan Engram,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/denver-broncos-tight-end-concerns-remain-unresolved-after-2025-nfl-draft-despite-signing-evan-engram/articleshow/120731771.cms,"Broncos’ tight end concerns remain unresolved after 2025 NFL Draft (Imagn Images)

Tight end productivity was a problem — is Evan Engram the solution or just a stopgap?

Late-round flier Caleb Lohner is intriguing, but far from ready

As the dust settles on the 2025 NFL Draft, the Denver Broncos' approach to upgrading their tight end room remains a topic of concern. Despite a clear need for improvement at the position, Denver’s moves suggest they may still be walking a tightrope heading into the new season.The Broncos’ tight end corps struggled mightily in 2024, with Lucas Krull leading the group with just 19 receptions. That level of production is far from what’s expected in a modern NFL offense, especially one that lacks elite wide receiver depth.In response, Denver made a splash by signing veteran Evan Engram in free agency. A former Pro Bowler, Engram posted an impressive 100 receptions in 2023. However, red flags remain. The 30-year-old missed eight games last season due to injury and has a history of durability issues. Additionally, while Engram can be a high-volume target, concerns persist about his ability to generate yards after the catch — a critical skill in Sean Payton's offense.If Engram is sidelined again, Denver could be forced to rely on a group that already proved inadequate last season. That’s a troubling possibility for a team trying to build a stable foundation around a still-developing quarterback situation.Rather than targeting tight end help early in the draft, Denver waited until the seventh round to select Caleb Lohner — a player better known for his basketball resume than football. The 6'8"" Lohner played hoops at Baylor, BYU, and Utah before switching to football, where he recorded just four catches — all touchdowns — in one season.Lohner is clearly a long-term developmental project, not a plug-and-play contributor. While his size and athleticism make him an intriguing red-zone weapon, he's unlikely to offer meaningful production in 2025.Also Read: Jacksonville Jaguars’ 2025 draft blunder: Skipping defensive tackle could ruin their season With the season approaching, Denver’s tight end room hinges heavily on Engram staying healthy and producing at a high level. The team may look to bolster the position via late free-agent signings or post-camp roster cuts, but as of now, depth and experience remain thin.If Engram goes down, it’s hard to see how the Broncos avoid falling back into the same offensive rut. The potential is there — but so are the risks.","Denver Broncos' tight end corps struggled mightily in 2024, with Lucas Krull leading the group with just 19 receptions.

From Texas to the NFL: Deion Sanders' Texas mansion is more than just a home — it's a training paradise for his sons



“Can’t nothing stop us” - Sanders family after NFL draft 🔥 #NFL #shilosanders (via @shilo sanders)

Deion Sanders, a Hall of Fame football player turned coach, has always been at the center of football excellence. However, his family is now stepping into the spotlight as his two sons, Shedeur and Shilo Sanders, make their mark in the NFL, continuing the Sanders family legacy.On April 26, a momentous day for the Sanders family, Shedeur, the 23-year-old quarterback, was drafted by the Cleveland Browns . Just hours later, his older brother, 25-year-old Shilo, who had gone undrafted earlier in the 2025 NFL Draft, signed a contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent. The Sanders brothers’ entry into the NFL adds them to the growing list of siblings in the league, showcasing the family’s undeniable athletic talent.Despite Shedeur being projected as a first-round pick, he was selected in the fifth round, which led to some speculation that his father's influence may have played a role in his lower-than-expected draft standing. Regardless, the Sanders family maintained their resilience throughout the process. “Both of y’all, you’re resilient,” Deion, 57, expressed during a Twitch livestream on Saturday. “The draft tested the whole family. I’m thankful. Tampa’s a wonderful spot.”The Sanders family opted not to attend the draft in Green Bay, Wisconsin, instead watching the event from their home in Texas. The surprise of Shedeur not being drafted higher was shared by everyone, including Shedeur himself. Reflecting on the unexpected turn of events, Shedeur expressed on social media, “We all didn’t expect this, of course. But I feel like with God, anything’s possible — everything’s possible. I don’t feel like this happened for no reason.”While Deion’s illustrious playing days are behind him, coaching the Colorado Buffaloes football team, his support for his sons remains steadfast. He ensures that his boys have everything they need to succeed both on and off the field. Deion’s sprawling 5,000-acre Texas ranch provides the ideal environment for his sons to prepare for the NFL. The brothers enjoy their own private space, which includes a fully equipped backyard featuring a turf football field, basketball court, pool, and hot tub—a dream setup for any aspiring NFL player.Deion’s support for his sons goes beyond just material wealth. It's about providing them with the resources, encouragement, and a sense of stability to fulfill their football dreams. As the family continues to build their own NFL legacies, it’s clear that their resilience and dedication, combined with a bit of Sanders-style flair, will make them a force to be reckoned with in the league.As both Shedeur and Shilo embark on their NFL careers, the world is watching, and Deion's belief in his sons will undoubtedly continue to inspire them on their journeys. The Sanders family's presence in the NFL is only just beginning, and the excitement around their futures is palpable.Also Read: Shilo Sanders 'fired' dad Deion Sanders as agent amid outrage over brother Shedeur's NFL Draft fall","Shedeur and Shilo Sanders were drafted by the Cleveland Browns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively.
