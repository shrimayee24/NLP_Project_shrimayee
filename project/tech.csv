The Proposed Trade: Moody for Washington

Why this trade makes sense for both teams

Theface a pivotal offseason as they balance developing young talent with maximizing Stephen Curry’s championship window. A potential trade involving Moses Moody for Dallas Mavericks forwardcould be the key to strengthening their roster.The Warriors’ young core—Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, and Moses Moody—has shown promise, but the team may need more experienced players to remain title contenders. With Curry entering his 17th season, Golden State is exploring trades to add playoff-tested contributors.Key reasons for the potential move:- Curry’s timeline demands win-now moves. The Warriors lack reliable wing depth.- PJ Washington offers two-way versatility and shooting.Washington, a 6’7” forward, had a strong 2024-25 season with the Mavericks, averaging:His ability to stretch the floor and defend multiple positions makes him an ideal fit in Steve Kerr’s system. As : ""With the incoming arrival of Cooper Flagg, teams are expecting the Mavericks to make PJ Washington available on the trade market for a rotational upgrade this summer."" (H/t: Sporting News)As proposed by Evan Sidery and elaborated by Dean Simon , the Golden State Warriors could offer:- Moses Moody (young guard with potential)- Future second-round picksIn return, Dallas would send PJ Washington, giving Golden State a proven forward on an expiring $46 million deal.- Warriors get a playoff-ready wing to support Curry.- Mavericks free up space for future roster moves while adding a developmental piece in Moody.Losing Moody would be a tough decision, but the Warriors must prioritize Stephen Curry ’s remaining prime years. Washington’s experience and skill set could be the missing piece for another deep playoff run.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Josh Giddey’s $120M Payday - The Chicago Bulls’ High-Stakes Bet on Their Aussie Superstar As Dean Simon noted in the original report, Washington’s extension eligibility in August could spark a competitive trade market, making this a move Golden State should consider sooner rather than later.",Moses Moody could be traded to the Golden State Warriors for Dallas Mavericks forward PJ Washington.

It has become one of NYT’s most popular games, encouraging analytical thinking and lateral problem-solving.Each day, you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that are connected in a meaningful way. Connections might be literal (like “bike parts”) or thematic (like “Best Picture winners”).

These are essential to the structure and movement of a standard bike.Blue Group – Best Picture Winners:All four—Chicago (2002), Crash (2005), Gladiator (2000), and Moonlight (2016)—won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Recognising them requires a bit of pop culture or film buff knowledge.Purple Group – Music Genres + a Letter:This was today’s trickiest category. Each word is a modified version of a popular music genre:Bluest = BluesPope = PopRocky = RockSkat = SkaThe added or altered letters cleverly disguise the genre, creating a challenging but rewarding puzzle category for sharp-eyed solvers.Whether you're a puzzle veteran or a new player, Connections continues to deliver fun, frustration, and satisfaction in equal measure.

In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China. The competition, part of the China Media Group (CMG) World Robot Competition – Mecha Fighting Series, was held on May 25 and marked the debut of robotic fighters in a full-fledged combat sport.The robots were developed by Unitree Robotics, a Chinese tech company known for its advanced humanoid machines. Four Unitree G1 robots took part in the fight, each about 132 centimeters tall and weighing 35 kilograms, reported Asia Times.They were remotely controlled by human trainers using joysticks, and the match was broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV).While the event sparked excitement among viewers, one social media user commented humorously, “The part that confuses me most is the referee in the ring.”Videos from the match showed the robots exchanging punches and kicks with surprising coordination. Although the strikes were more like soft pushes than real hits, the movements displayed impressive balance and speed for machines.The match was part of a larger effort to test and showcase the growing abilities of AI and robotics in dynamic settings.Earlier this year, a Unitree robot was seen in a viral video aggressively reacting to its handlers during a demo, raising safety concerns.In another case, during February’s Spring Festival Gala in Tianjin, a robot reportedly charged toward a crowd, alarming attendees.Such incidents, including a recent case at Tesla's factory in Texas where a robot allegedly injured a worker, have sparked growing concern over AI safety and the potential risks of advanced robotics. Experts have pointed to software glitches and inadequate testing as common causes, highlighting the need for strict quality control in AI development."," humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Auto Frame uses generative AI to suggest different compositions and fill blank spaces when cropping or widening images, while Reimagine allows users to add elements to photos through text descriptions.The update introduces AI Enhance, which automatically combines multiple effects like image sharpening and object removal to produce three editing variations. Users can also tap specific areas of images to receive targeted editing suggestions, with contextual tools appearing for selected objects or backgrounds.The interface redesign replaces the previous double-tiered menu system with three thumbnail options: Enhance, Dynamic, and the new AI Enhance feature. Controls for aspect ratio, flip, and rotate functions have been relocated above images for easier access.Photos is also introducing QR code sharing for albums, enabling instant access for group events like weddings without traditional sharing permissions. Users can generate scannable codes that allow others to view or contribute photos directly. Google says that 1.5 billion people use Photos monthly, with over 9 trillion photos and videos stored on the platform. Users perform 370 million searches, share 440 million memories, and edit 210 million photos each month.The redesigned editor will begin rolling out globally to Android devices next month, with iOS support following later this year.

Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life.

xAI’s Grok 3 AI models now available on Microsoft Azure

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

"Qualcomm questions Apple's decision to use its own C1 chip in iPhone 16e, claims its modems are significantly more dependable",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-questions-apples-decision-to-use-its-own-c1-chip-in-iphone-16e-claims-its-modems-are-significantly-more-dependable/articleshow/121465872.cms,"What Qualcomm said about Apple’s CI modem chip

Qualcomm has raised questions about Apple 's decision to use its in-house C1 modem chip in the iPhone 16e. This stems from a study commissioned by the chipmaker, which suggested that its chips perform better than Apple’s in certain conditions. The study found that its modem chips delivered better performance than Apple's rival component, particularly for cellular customers in dense urban areas. According to a report by Cellular Insights (seen by Bloomberg), the iPhone 16e , the first smartphone to feature Apple’s in-house C1 modem, exhibited slower download and upload speeds on T-Mobile’s 5G network in New York City compared to Qualcomm-powered Android devices .Apple has spent several years developing the C1 component. This effort is part of a broader strategy by Apple to replace parts from external suppliers with its own internally developed technology. Modern chips are a crucial component in any mobile phone, as they facilitate the device's connection to cellular towers, enabling calls and internet access.The report claims to have compared the C1 phone’s modem performance with that of Android smartphones using Qualcomm chips. It found that while the C1 “performed adequately under optimal conditions,” it lagged in “the very scenarios where next-generation modems are expected to excel.”In dense urban, indoor, or uplink-intensive environments, Android devices with Qualcomm modems demonstrated improvements that were “quantifiable, repeatable and operationally significant.”Apple CEO Tim Cook described the iPhone 16e rollout as successful and said it features “the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone.” However, the study reported that two similarly priced Android phones equipped with Qualcomm components achieved download speeds up to 35% faster and upload speeds up to 91% faster than the iPhone 16e. These gaps widened under heavy network load or when the phones were farther from cell towers.The report also noted the iPhone became “noticeably hot to touch and exhibited aggressive screen dimming within just two-minute test intervals,” though it did not assess real-world data drops or battery life.

Fans push back as podcast shifts away from NFL-centered content

The Kelce brothers respond to criticism and defend the decision

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother, recently retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, are no strangers to entertaining fans with their popular “New Heights” podcast. But their latest guest announcement—NHL icon Wayne Gretzky—has triggered a wave of criticism from longtime listeners, many of whom are questioning the podcast’s direction.The Kelce brothers have built a strong following by delivering candid football commentary, player stories, and behind-the-scenes insights from the NFL. However, their decision to feature a sports legend from outside of football has stirred up controversy. The backlash began almost immediately after the guest announcement, with fans taking to social media to vent their frustrations.“This is a football podcast, not a hockey show,” one disappointed fan wrote. Another added, “I tune in for football insights, not interviews with hockey players.” Another wrote, “So Trump went after Taylor and your answer is to invite a big trumpie guy who is friend with him ?!? Have some shame.”While Gretzky’s legacy as ""The Great One"" is undeniable in the hockey world, many listeners believe that his appearance strays too far from what originally made “New Heights” compelling—its deep NFL focus and the chemistry between the Kelce brothers.Despite the criticism, both Travis and Jason Kelce have stood by their decision, defending the value of cross-sport dialogue and the broader vision for their podcast.""Wayne Gretzky is a legend, and there's always something to learn from the greats, no matter the sport,"" Travis Kelce said, underscoring Gretzky’s relevance as a universally respected athlete. Jason added, ""It's about broadening perspectives and bringing fresh content to our listeners.""Their comments reflect a clear intention to evolve the show beyond its NFL roots and embrace voices from other areas of sports and life.As Travis continues preparations for OTAs with the Chiefs and Jason transitions into his post-playing career, the podcast represents an important outlet for both. But the Gretzky episode has highlighted a key challenge: maintaining authenticity and connection with a loyal football audience while trying to grow creatively.Also Read: The Kansas City Chiefs’ jersey number no one dares to wear — and the heartbreaking reason why The Kelces may be betting on the long-term benefits of diversity in content, but this moment shows how quickly fan sentiment can shift when expectations are disrupted.

A gym member’s disrespect sparks outrage

Still under scrutiny after Travis Kelce breakup

Model and influencer Kayla Nicole, who dated NFL star Travis Kelce for five years before their 2022 split, found herself at the center of a disturbing gym incident over Memorial Day Weekend. The outspoken media personality took to Instagram to vent about an uncomfortable interaction that left her visibly frustrated — and it had nothing to do with her famous ex.In a now-viral Instagram Story, Nicole shared that a fellow gymgoer blew vape smoke in her face while attempting to use the same equipment she was using.""Blowing your blueberry eggs and ham vape smoke in my face in the gym while trying to ask if I'm done with the smith machine will get you slapped. tf wrong with all?"" she wrote, pairing the caption with a workout selfie.Clearly fed up, she later posted a short video showing the vape device on the gym floor, adding, “I want to step on it.” Though she didn’t name the individual, her message was clear: public gym etiquette is no place for invasive behavior — especially when it crosses personal boundaries.While the incident itself caught attention, Nicole continues to be a lightning rod for online hate — largely fueled by her past relationship with Travis Kelce and his high-profile romance with global superstar Taylor Swift . Despite having moved on, Nicole says that critics, particularly Swift's fans, have been relentless.On the Second Wind podcast, Nicole addressed the constant backlash. ""People will always say, 'Get over it,' which is so interesting,"" she said. ""And to them I'd say, 'You too.' Life handed me lemons and I made a lemon martini out of it and that upsets people.""She’s also spoken candidly about the emotional toll of the breakup and its aftermath, especially in the era of social media. ""Behind closed doors, the hardest part is losing a partner, a best friend, speaking every day to cutting ties. Then you throw in social media,” Nicole said.Nicole told WNBA star Angel Reese during a separate conversation that the “combination of everything” nearly made her want to disappear. From baseless insults to degrading comments, she’s been on the receiving end of vitriol that many believe has less to do with her actions and more to do with being associated with Kelce and Swift.“It is nothing to do with me,” she said. “I think there is something about that level of fame that attracts crazy people.”Also Read: “My biggest trophy”: Tom Brady’s heartfelt post sparks speculation amid Gisele Bündchen’s engagement rumors Despite the hate, Nicole remains unapologetically herself — calling out disrespect, standing up to bullies, and refusing to fade quietly into the background.","Model and influencer Kayla Nicole dated Travis Kelce for five years before their 2022 split.

Study issues warning of GTA 6 launch-related mass absences

“GTA flu”

Historical trends indicate the phenomenon is genuine

""gaming sick days""

The debut ofis shaping up to be one of the most eagerly awaited entertainment launches of the decade and it might come with an unexpected side effect: theA recent study shows that nationwide search interest in the game has reached record levels, suggesting that millions of U.S. workers may take the day off, whether through approved leave or by calling in sick, once the game drops.A recent report from fan site GTA Boom, extensively covered by TweakTown and GamingBible, suggests that GTA 6 release might lead to a tide of coincidentally scheduled sick leave. The data suggests that Florida, California, and Texas are among the states leading the chart in anticipation level, with Florida beating the national average by 31%.Matt Gibbs, head of GTA Boom, observed, Considering the trend in huge sick day spikes upon release of high-profile titles, such as Red Dead Redemption II, it would come as no surprise to hear of an outbreak ofwhen the game comes out. He also cautioned employers in areas of high interest to prepare for an evident spike in time-off requests near the release date.This would not be the first time a Rockstar game inspired an unofficial holiday.When Grand Theft Auto V was released in 2013, a survey by IGN found that 46% of the 10,995 people who participated took the day off. Of those people, almost 2,100 said they were pretending to be sick in order to take the day off.GTA Boom research draws on this cultural phenomenon and uses Google search traffic and social activity to measure the levels of excitement and make predictions about behavior. The concept ofhas become more prevalent, particularly for one-in-a-generation games such as GTA 6 that create huge worldwide buzz.Although Rockstar Games has not yet made an official announcement regarding a release date, it's obvious that GTA 6 is already making waves. If past experience is anything to go by, and all indications are that it may be, employers can expect a dead day at the office. The virtual Vice City streets may end up being busier than the physical world when the launch date finally rolls around.Also Read: MindsEye’s $60 price tag sets new expectations for GTA 6 players","Study issues warning of GTA 6 launch-related mass absences.

MindsEye: A new game from a Rockstar veteran

""a refreshing departure""

What MindsEye's launch means for GTA 6 players

The video game world is abuzz with the soon-to-be-released title MindsEye, a new game from Build A Rocket Boy, founded by former Rockstar North veteran Leslie Benzies. Launching on June 10, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, MindsEye is priced at $59.99. This price decision defies the current trend of AAA game prices going up and can set a precedent for how gamers perceive the value and pricing of the long-awaited GTA 6.MindsEye is based in the near-future city of Redrock and offers a linear story campaign packed tightly along with a single-player free roam mode. The gamers will experience Jacob Diaz, a veteran soldier who discovers an in-depth conspiracy that incorporates rogue AI, corporate profiteering, and military excess. Developed on Unreal Engine 5, the game offers breathtaking visuals and comprehensive gameplay.The $59.99 cost is surprising, particularly in light of the recent trend towards AAA game pricing, as many new releases have been reaching the $70 to $80 mark. Build A Rocket Boy highlights that this price representsfrom convention, striking a balance between quality and price.Besides the core narrative and free roam, MindsEye includes a number of missions, racing modes, and combat modes, with regular monthly content updates scheduled through 2025.A bespoke PC-only game development system enables players to create their own games, with long-term value and creativity added to the game.MindsEye's introduction and pricing model established the new bar for GTA 6 players expecting to receive their next big game from Rockstar. Although Rockstar is not yet announcing the price of GTA 6, MindsEye's precedent indicates that the golden ratio of price, content, and updates will be important considerations in player satisfaction.With MindsEye offering a constant flow of fresh missions, challenges, and player-generated content, GTA 6 enthusiasts can anticipate Rockstar to provide equally deep post-launch support. Additionally, the innovative creation features in MindsEye signal the increasing role of player creativity in open-world games, which may suggest upcoming features in GTA 6.This change in expectation translates to players desiring more than the initial cost, they expect continued value, engaging experiences, and creative liberty. Rockstar's answer to these new expectations will probably define how the community embraces GTA 6 at launch.As MindsEye prepares to launch in June with a budget-friendly yet feature-rich strategy, it's setting a precedent for future AAA games, including GTA 6. Gamers now anticipate not only a quality game at launch but also ongoing updates and creative tools that make the game last longer. Rockstar will have to take these new standards into consideration to keep up with the expectations of players and keep GTA's mythical status intact in the world of gaming.Also Read: GTA 6 and your PC: What to upgrade and how to save money","MindsEye is based in the near-future city of Redrock and offers a linear story campaign packed tightly along with a single-player free roam mode.
