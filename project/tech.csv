In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step. Here’s how the process works:","UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID in one step. Age-based validity auto-assigned through ICP’s digital platforms.

Tejasvi’s vision: Helping seniors navigate the internet safely and confidently

In February 2024, 16-year-old Tejasvi Manoj from Frisco, Texas, faced an experience that would inspire her to protect seniors from online scams. While driving home from Scouting America camp with her father, she discovered that her 85-year-old grandfather had received a seemingly urgent email from a relative requesting $2,000 to cover an unexpected debt. Ready to comply, he was fortunately stopped by her father’s intervention. A quick phone call to the supposed relative confirmed the request was fraudulent. Witnessing how easily older adults can fall victim to digital scams, Tejasvi was motivated to research the growing threat of cybercrime targeting seniors and eventually develop Shield Seniors, a platform dedicated to educating and safeguarding older adults online.Tejasvi Manoj is a high school student, accomplished coder, and founder of Shield Seniors, a cybersecurity platform aimed at educating and protecting older adults from online scams. Beyond her technological expertise, she is deeply involved in community service: earning her Eagle Scout rank, volunteering with the North Texas Food Bank Young Advocates Council, tutoring Bhutanese refugees, and performing in her school orchestra.Her parents, both IT professionals, nurtured her early interest in technology. By eighth grade, Tejasvi was fluent in programming languages including Java, Python, and HTML, and actively participated in cybersecurity initiatives like Girls Who Code and Cyber-Patriot. These experiences equipped her to address a pressing social issue using technology.Seniors represent a particularly target-rich demographic for cybercriminals. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, nearly 860,000 reports of online scams were filed in 2024, resulting in potential losses exceeding $16 billion. Fraud directed at individuals over 60 accounted for $5 billion, a 32% increase from the previous year.The Federal Trade Commission reports that losses exceeding $10,000 among older adults quadrupled from 2020 to 2024, while losses over $100,000 increased sevenfold. This alarming trend underscores the urgency for effective solutions to safeguard retirees, pensioners, and seniors from financial exploitation online.Motivated by her grandfather’s experience, Tejasvi developed Shield Seniors, a website designed to empower seniors with knowledge and tools to navigate the digital landscape safely. The platform offers four core sections:The platform prioritises independence and confidence, empowering seniors to navigate the internet safely while reducing reliance on family members for technical support.Creating Shield Seniors required balancing multiple responsibilities. Tejasvi remained active in Scouting America, earned her Eagle Scout rank, played violin in her school orchestra, tutored refugees online, and volunteered in food security initiatives—all while designing and coding the platform.Her work has earned national recognition. She received an honorable mention in the 2024 Congressional App Challenge, delivered a 2025 TEDx talk on bridging digital divides, and became TIME Magazine’s Kid of the Year 2025, also earning the distinction of TIME for Kids Service Star.Tejasvi credits her success to strong mentorship. Her parents provided hands-on support in coding and cybersecurity, while Aarathi Rajamanickam, a software engineering manager, served as a mentor, offering guidance in AI, cybersecurity, and software development. Programs such as Girls Who Code and Cyber-Patriot further honed her technical skills, preparing her to address real-world cybersecurity threats effectively.Currently in private preview mode, Shield Seniors relies on a free AI engine that limits audience capacity. Tejasvi is fundraising to transition to a commercial AI platform to expand access and reach more seniors nationwide. She also plans to conduct in-person workshops at assisted-living facilities, helping older adults gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity.Her vision is clear: to empower seniors to navigate the online world independently, confidently, and safely while educating families on supporting older relatives in protecting themselves from fraud.","Tejasvi Manoj is the founder of Shield Seniors, a cybersecurity platform aimed at educating and protecting older adults from online scams.

The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy.

On the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality. The International Astronomical Centre will stream the entire celestial event live from Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory, making it accessible to a global audience.The International Astronomical Centre confirmed that it will livestream the total lunar eclipse using a telescope stationed at the Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory. The broadcast is scheduled to run for more than four hours, from, providing uninterrupted real-time coverage of the phenomenon.According to Engineer Mohammed Shawkat Odah, Director of the International Astronomical Centre, the eclipse will unfold in several distinct stages:Odah noted that the most visually dramatic period — when the Moon turns a striking shade of red — will last 82 minutes, making it one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent years. This stage, known as totality, will be clearly visible to the naked eye across all seven emirates from 9:30 PM to 10:52 PM GST.Additionally, Odah stated that the phenomenon can be observed at different stages across the Arab region depending on geographic location:A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow (umbra) onto the Moon. During this alignment, sunlight passes through Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red tones to reach the Moon’s surface. This atmospheric refraction creates the phenomenon commonly known as a Blood Moon.Two aspects make tonight’s event particularly remarkable:The Moon will not completely disappear during totality. Instead, it will take on shades of orange, red, or yellow, depending on atmospheric conditions. According to Odah, the color intensity is a reflection of atmospheric purity. Increased pollution, for instance, can cause the Moon to appear dark red or brown. In rare instances, such as the December 12, 1992 eclipse (influenced by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines), the Moon has vanished entirely from view during totality.The total eclipse phase, where the Moon is fully immersed in the Earth’s umbra, will be.

A unified vision for land and water mobility





Dubai is advancing its vision of a smarter, more connected city with two major transport projects now underway: the construction of the Dh20.5-billion Dubai Metro Blue Line and the launch of two new marine stations on Dubai Creek. These developments are set to significantly reduce congestion, cut travel times, and boost mobility across key urban and waterfront areas.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line, a massive infrastructure project that will expand the city’s rail network by 30 kilometres and add 14 new stations. As part of the initial works, a key traffic diversion has been introduced near Centrepoint Station, affecting access from Airport Road to the multi-storey car park.Motorists can now reach the car park via 49C Street, making a left turn west of the facility. The RTA has urged drivers to follow all directional signboards, plan trips ahead, and use alternative routes to avoid delays. Similar traffic changes are also in effect near Creek Station, as early construction continues there as well.The Blue Line is expected to open by September 9, 2029, and is designed to carry 46,000 passengers per hour in both directions.It aims to reduce traffic congestion by 20% on the routes it serves, cutting travel time between key residential areas and Dubai International Airport to just 20 minutes.When complete, the Blue Line will extend the total length of the Dubai Metro network to 131km, serving 78 stations and operating 28 trains. The project is expected to generate Dh56 million in profits and carry 200,000 passengers per day by 2030, with that number projected to rise to 320,000 by 2040.These areas are expected to be home to over one million people, as envisioned in the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan.Travel times along the Blue Line will range from 10 to 25 minutes, significantly improving daily commutes for thousands of residents.In a separate milestone, the RTA has also inaugurated two new marine transport stations:Both are strategically located on Dubai Creek and support the RTA’s Marine Transport Strategic Plan 2020–2030, which aims to make water transport a key part of the emirate’s mobility network.These stations follow the design principles of recently upgraded facilities like Bur Dubai and Old Deira Souq, combining modernisation with heritage preservation.The newly opened stations feature enhanced capacity and passenger experience, aligning with upgrades seen across the network, such as the 15% capacity increase at Deira Old Souq Station earlier this year.The stations were completed simultaneously to reduce costs and accelerate delivery, with a new operational plan in place to ensure timely trips, safe navigation, and efficient services.Marine transport ridership is on the rise, with 9.7 million passengers using the network in the first half of 2025 alone — a strong indicator of public confidence in Dubai’s evolving transport infrastructure.Together, the Dubai Metro Blue Line and the new marine stations reflect a city-wide push to create a seamlessly integrated, multimodal transport network. These upgrades are not only addressing current mobility needs but are also being built with future urban growth and sustainability in mind. The RTA is also exploring smart technologies to enhance real-time connectivity and improve overall commuter experience across the transport network.As work progresses, the RTA continues to advise residents and commuters to stay informed about diversions and changes, and to plan travel in advance. Whether by rail or water, Dubai’s transport infrastructure is moving swiftly toward a more connected, efficient, and accessible future.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line.

Communication features disabled in Saudi Arabia and UAE

“The safety and well-being of children online is a top priority... We will continue to work together to ensure a safe, trusted, and positive digital environment for all UAE users, especially children.”

Regional bans and content moderation efforts

Kuwait’s ban was announced on August 21, 2025, following community complaints.



Qatar restricted access on August 13, although the government has not publicly commented.



Turkey blocked the platform on August 7, with Roblox stating it is cooperating with authorities.



Oman and Jordan imposed earlier restrictions, and the game is currently restricted in various degrees across countries like Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Yemen.





“As part of this vision, and in view of recent discussions with regulatory authorities in a number of countries across the Middle East, we are committing to enhance our Arabic communication and content moderation capabilities.”





Guardian investigation reveals serious safety lapses

Voice and text chat features were accessible even to users listed as under 13, due to easily bypassed age verification mechanisms.



Test avatars registered as children accessed sexually suggestive environments, including virtual hotel rooms, fetish accessories, and public bathrooms that enabled inappropriate roleplay.



Audio from voice chat included explicit sounds like kissing, grunting, and slurping, which the platform’s real-time AI moderation failed to filter.



In one case, an adult avatar was able to solicit Snapchat details from a five-year-old avatar using barely disguised language.





“There are bad actors on the internet... this is an issue that goes beyond Roblox and needs to be addressed through collaboration with governments and an industry-wide commitment to strong safety measures.”

Wider backlash and company response

Launching content tags



Updating parental tools



Increasing in-game moderation staff



Rolling out region-specific language moderation, especially in Arabic-speaking regions





“Our vision is to connect people with optimism and civility... by creating a platform where users of all ages can have a safe, civil and positive experience.”





Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, following mounting regional and global scrutiny over child safety. The move, which affects millions of young users in the Middle East ’s largest gaming markets, comes after discussions with government regulators and follows similar actions in other countries across the region.Roblox, the widely used online gaming and creation platform, has halted all in-experience communication features—including voice and text chat, for users in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The decision was made following talks with regulatory bodies in both nations and is part of a broader push to bolster digital child safety.In Saudi Arabia, the changes were coordinated with the General Authority for Media Regulation, which emphasized its role in protecting the public from the adverse effects of electronic games. According to the regulator, this measure aims to prevent exposure to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and potential online predatory behavior.Meanwhile, in the UAE, the move followed discussions between Roblox and the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). In a joint statement, the TDRA and Roblox said:Both countries have implemented the restrictions effective immediately.Roblox also committed to enhancing its Arabic-language content and introducing stronger moderation tools, including content filters and improved parental controls.The action in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is part of a wider wave of regulatory crackdowns across the Middle East. Several countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Oman, Jordan, and others, have already blocked access to Roblox entirely in response to escalating concerns over child safety.Roblox remains accessible in Saudi Arabia, which is considered one of the largest emerging gaming markets in the region. However, the suspension of chat functions marks a significant shift in how the platform is being regulated there.Roblox has stated:A key driver of these policy shifts was an investigation by The Guardian and UK-based research agency Revealing Reality, which exposed critical failures in Roblox’s safety systems, particularly its chat features. The report documented how children as young as five were able to interact with adults inside the platform’s games, often without any effective moderation.Key findings from the investigation include:The researchers concluded that while Roblox advertises itself as a “child-friendly” platform, its safety features are limited in their effectiveness, and the actual in-game experience often contradicts that appearance.In response, Roblox acknowledged:The company also admitted that age verification for under-13 users continues to be an industry-wide challenge.Beyond the Middle East, Roblox has faced increasing legal and public pressure to improve safety controls. In August 2025, Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, accusing it of facilitating the systemic sexual exploitation and abuse of children in the United States.The company has also drawn backlash for banning content creators like Schlep, a vigilante YouTuber known for acting as a self-proclaimed “predator hunter” within the game. Schlep claims to have contributed to the arrest of six suspected predators before being banned by Roblox for violating community guidelines.Roblox has responded with a series of measures:The company reiterated its long-term goal:Despite these efforts, confidence among parents, regulators, and users remains shaken. The recent steps in the UAE and Saudi Arabia mark a turning point in the platform’s ongoing struggle to reconcile its popularity with its responsibility to protect young users.",Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

Why was Princess Diana’s time capsule sealed

Public and historical significance





A rare glimpse into the world of the early 1990s has been unlocked with the opening of a time capsule once linked to Princess Diana. Sealed more than three decades ago, the capsule has unveiled a fascinating collection of cultural artefacts and personal memorabilia that vividly capture the spirit of the era. From music and fashion to everyday consumer objects, the discoveries offer an intimate reflection of the time Diana lived through and the broader cultural landscape of the early ‘90s. The opening of the capsule has not only sparked renewed public curiosity about her life and legacy but also rekindled interest in the social history of a decade still fondly remembered today.The capsule’s contents painted a vivid picture of the early 1990s. Among the most striking discoveries was a Kylie Minogue CD, reflecting Diana’s well-known interest in contemporary music and her connection with pop culture. A small pocket-sized television symbolised the rapid shift in consumer technology at the time, when portable gadgets were becoming increasingly popular. Old newspapers preserved inside offered insights into the political and social debates of 1991, while glossy magazines highlighted the fashion trends that Diana herself helped popularise.Each artefact collectively recreated a snapshot of an era when Diana stood at the centre of both royal life and international celebrity culture.The creation of the time capsule was intended to preserve the essence of the moment for posterity. By capturing artefacts from 1991, the capsule became a curated window into Diana’s world—a year that marked both personal challenges and public triumphs for her. Historians suggest it was designed to reflect not only her personal interests but also the broader social and cultural context that defined the early 1990s. At a time when Diana was reshaping the image of the monarchy through her openness and relatability, the capsule stands as a symbolic act of remembrance, preserving tangible fragments of a rapidly changing world. Its opening now allows both fans and historians to connect more personally with Diana’s life and the era she influenced.The opening of the capsule has generated fascination far beyond royal enthusiasts. For the public, the contents stir nostalgia for a decade often remembered with fondness and curiosity. For historians, the capsule provides a rare cultural archive, bridging the gap between Diana’s personal story and broader historical currents. Newspapers and magazines inside the capsule act as valuable primary sources, allowing future generations to study not only Diana’s era but also the everyday concerns, entertainment, and technology of the time. It highlights how deeply Diana was embedded in the cultural fabric, not as a distant royal figure but as someone closely tied to global popular culture.The capsule has once again brought Diana’s enduring influence to the forefront. While the items inside may appear ordinary at first glance, their rediscovery has reminded the world of how extraordinary Diana’s presence was during her lifetime.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

"Microsoft sends company wide memo, asks employees to return to office; read the full letter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-sends-company-wide-memo-asks-employees-to-return-to-office-read-the-full-letter/articleshow/123811445.cms,"Microsoft considered stricter RTO policy earlier this year



Read the full memo sent to employees:



How we work has forever changed. I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.

In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.

We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.

With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.

We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.

Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.

For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.

What you need to know:

Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.

Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.

All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.

Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.

As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.

Thank you,

Amy

Microsoft is implementing a new policy that requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week. This mandate was detailed in an internal email sent to staff by Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman. According to the memo, the new return-to-office (RTO) policy will roll out in three phases. The first phase, starting in late February 2026, will affect Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office.The policy will then be extended to other US offices before being implemented internationally. Employees have until September 19 to request an exception, though the email did not provide specific details on how the exception process will work.Reports suggested that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy for some time now. Compared to its other tech giants, Microsoft has reportedly been more lenient than competitors like Amazon, and even Zoom, which sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023.Microsoft's initial flexible work policy, introduced in late 2020, allowed employees to work from home for at least half of the time. This new three-day-a-week requirement brings Microsoft in line with similar policies at Meta and Google.","Microsoft is implementing a new policy that requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week.
