Patna Headlines Today — Key Stories You Shouldn’t Miss.







Sonepur division of the East Central Railway (ECR), which recently introduced an innovative system called Q-Mitra at Begusarai station under pilot project, has evoked good response from passengers so far.This new system is designed to allow passengers to procure Tatkal tickets quickly and seamlessly, leveraging cutting-edge technology for a hassle-free experience.Under the system, passengers can now obtain a token before the opening of the Tatkal ticket booking window at 10am for both AC and sleeper class. The token will be generated through an AI-based face recognition system integrated with Aadhaar-based authentication. The process ensures complete transparency and eliminates the need for passengers to stand in queues, said Sonepur divisional railway manager (DRM) Amit Saran.Once the token is issued, passengers can proceed to book their Tatkal tickets smoothly, while maintaining full transparency throughout the process. The system captures the last four digits of the passenger’s Aadhaar number, which is cross-referenced with the face recognition data, adding an additional layer of security to prevent fraudulent activities, the DRM said.According to the DRM, the new system ensures that each passenger can book a Tatkal ticket only once per day. This rule effectively blocks any attempt to book multiple tickets within a short time frame, ensuring fairness and equitable access to the Tatkal ticket window, he said, adding Q-Mitra marks a major step towards modernising the ticket booking process and addressing long-standing challenges faced by train passengers in the region.According to Sonepur senior divisional commercial manager (senior DCM) Raushan Kumar, utilising AI and Aadhaar-based identification, the Q-Mitra initiative promises to streamline operations and improve the overall travel experience. “The Q-Mitra not only reduces waiting time, but also ensures greater transparency in the ticket booking process,” Kumar said.He said the system that will be gradually rolled out across various stations in the Sonepur division is expected to serve as a model for other railway divisions in the days to come.","East Central Railway's Sonepur division has launched Q-Mitra at Begusarai station, a pilot project using AI and Aadhaar for swift Tatkal ticket booking.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention. This geological defiance has influenced settlement patterns, pilgrimage routes, dam construction, ecological debates, and identities for centuries across western India.The Narmada is the river that flows west instead of east. It is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres. The Narmada River does not empty into the Bay of Bengal like the Ganga or Godavari do. It travels steadily westward from its source until it eventually reaches the Arabian Sea.The Tapi is another prominent example of the few big Indian rivers that follow this path. The idea that the Narmada runs ""backwards"" originates from the fact that the majority of the region's rivers flow in the opposite direction, eastward.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. While the upper areas are hilly and forested, with less people living nearby, the land becomes flatter and more open when you go further west. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

"‘Purpose of task vs. job’: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explains why AI will change jobs, not eliminate them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/purpose-of-task-vs-job-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-explains-why-ai-will-change-jobs-not-eliminate-them/articleshow/127138253.cms,"Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

AI helps Jensen Huang type less, but think more

Software engineering and hiring growth

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility.

Chennai is forecast for a damp and warm, with moderate rain expected and temperatures remaining in the, accompanied by high humidity. Yesterday's air quality was categorized asby Indian AQI standards, with an AQI-IN of, which may cause discomfort for sensitive groups, especially when combined with the humid, rainy conditions. Individuals are advised to carry an umbrella and keep a mask available for stretches with heavy traffic. The week ahead indicates continued rain on Monday before transitioning to a sunny and more outdoor-friendly pattern from Tuesday through Saturday.Today's weather is characterized as warm, humid, and prone to rain. The high temperature is expected to reach, with a low of. The average temperature will be near, indicating that there will not be a sharp cool-down even after dark.Humidity levels will remain elevated at approximately. This level of humidity typically makes Chennai’s air feel heavier than what the thermometer suggests. Winds may increase at times, reaching a maximum speed of around. These winds could offer brief relief between showers, but they are also capable of pushing rain bands across different neighborhoods quickly.Rain is a significant feature of today's forecast. The city has anchance of experiencing rain, with aboutof total precipitation anticipated. This amount of precipitation points to intermittent spells rather than all-day flooding rain. However, it is expected to be enough to slow traffic and keep roads slick.Days within Chennai often follow a familiar rhythm. This typically includes a muggy morning, with showers building from late morning into the afternoon. Another burst of rain is possible around early evening, coinciding with commuter travel times. Residents should keep an eye out for sudden downpours rather than a steady drizzle.On the skies-and-light front, sunrise is scheduled for. Sunset will occur at. Those who prefer an early walk or outdoor exercise are encouraged to complete these activities earlier in the morning. This is before showers become more likely and the humidity peaks.Looking back at, Chennai recorded an AQI-IN of. This was classified asand fell into category. The corresponding AQI-US wasThis level of air quality can cause throat irritation or breathlessness for some people. This is particularly true for those with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, COPD, or allergies. Particulate pollution was a notable factor in yesterday's air quality., and. Both of these particulate matter levels can aggravate cough and wheeze, especially near busy junctions and construction corridors., contributing to the overall pollution load, but particulate matter remained the primary concern.The good news is that today’s rain and breezier periods often help wash out dust and fine particles. This process can lead to an improvement in short-term air quality. The flip side is that high humidity can trap pollutants near the ground between showers. Therefore, individuals may still noticeair during calm spells, particularly in dense traffic zones.Planning for the day involves carrying essential items. An umbrella or a rain jacket is considered non-negotiable. Waterproof footwear is also helpful, especially for those using public transport or walking short distances.Because yesterday’s air was only moderately clean, considering a mask during peak traffic hours is advisable. This is particularly relevant for those commuting by two-wheeler or waiting at bus stops. If scheduling errands, it is recommended to aim for mid-morning. This is before the heaviest-looking clouds build up. It is also wise to keep buffer time for slower roads. Indoors, individuals sensitive to air quality may find it beneficial to keep windows closed during traffic peaks. They can then ventilate after a shower when the air can feel fresher.The week ahead indicates that Chennai will remain unsettled for one more day., again calls for. Temperatures are expected to rise slightly, with a high ofand a low of.

Sunny skies are predicted every day during this period. High temperatures will be around. Nights will gradually become cooler, easing down to aboutby the weekend. This window, from Tuesday to Friday, appears to be the cleanest and simplest for planning outdoor activities. These activities could include a beach walk, a family outing, or any long outdoor task. During this time, keeping hydration and sunscreen in mind for the afternoon sun is recommended.One small bonus is that after a couple of wet days, the run of sunshine should help roads dry out. This will also reduce thediscomfort, even though Chennai will remain warm.Data referenced in this article is taken from AQI.in.","Chennai is forecast for a damp and warm, with moderate rain expected and temperatures remaining in the mid-20s.

The gang was busted after two victims blew the lid off.Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training. The gang targeted women by creating their AI-generated obscene videos and used them to blackmail and pressure them for religious conversion. The racket had been running since 2021, said police.Six accused, including a GRP head constable Irshad Khan, 40, have been arrested.The other five accused include gym owners and trainers — Mohammad Sheikh Ali Alam, 31, Faizal Khan, 34, Zaheer, 32, Shadab, 36, and Farid Ahmed, 28.Obscene AI-edited videos and photos recovered from the mobiles of the accused are a key evidence in the case, said police. The prime accused, gym owner Farid Ahmed, was arrested in an encounter after allegedly opening fire on a police team during a raid.SP/DIG Mirzapur, Somen Barma, told TOI that the racket came to light after two young women lodged separate complaints earlier this month, alleging that they were trapped, blackmailed, and pressured to change their religion using AI-generated obscene videos.Barma said the accused used to befriend women who joined their gyms and gradually gained access to their personal photographs and videos.""These were then morphed using AI tools to create explicit and obscene content. The victims were subsequently threatened with circulation of these AI-edited videos on social media unless they complied with the gang's demands, which included sexual exploitation and coercion to convert religion,"" Barma added.""Recovered mobiles contain dozens of AI-generated obscene videos and chats,"" said another senior officer, adding that most of the accused are Class dropouts.GRP head constable Irshad Khan, posted in Bhadohi, allegedly provided logistical support and protection to the syndicate.Investigators said that 4 of the 5 gyms — KGN-1.0, KGN-2.0, KGN-3.0, B-Fit, and Iron Fire — were run by 3 brothers and their brother-in-law.Mirzapur DM Pawan Kumar Gangwar has sealed all five gyms under the scanner till Feb 27.Police are trying to trace more and find whether the racket had links beyond Mirzapur. Digital forensics teams are analysing data to determine how widely the AI-generated content was shared and whether similar methods were used in other districts.""This was not just a blackmail case. It was a systematic attempt to exploit women psychologically and socially using technology,"" an officer said, adding that more arrests are likely to be made.Authorities have appealed to women who may have been targeted to come forward, assuring them protection and confidentiality.Police said many victims are married and do not want to report the case fearing social stigma and backlash from their families.","Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Some players will feel close almost immediately; others not at all. The grid fills, colours appear, and confidence shifts with every line.

KALYAN: At a time when academic pressure and emotional stress are taking a heavy toll on young minds, a remarkable life-saving innovation has emerged from a school classroom in Kalyan.Anuska Nandi, a 15-year-old Class 10 student of B. K. Birla Public School, has invented the “Suicide Saviour Fan”, a specially designed ceiling fan system aimed at preventing suicides among students living in hostels and paying guest accommodations, particularly in high-pressure institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), and coaching centres like Kota.India has witnessed a disturbing rise in student suicides, especially among engineering aspirants and college students facing intense competition, academic pressure, and emotional isolation. Hostel rooms, often fitted with ceiling fans, have tragically become the setting for many such incidents. Deeply affected by frequent newspaper reports, Anuska decided to channel her scientific curiosity and social concern into a practical solution that could help save lives.Anuska, who dreams of becoming a scientist, says she regularly read news about students dying by suicide in IITs and coaching institutes like Kota. Observing that ceiling fans were commonly used in such incidents, she felt the need to create a device that could interrupt an impulsive moment and give students a chance to survive. With this thought, she conceptualized the Suicide Saviour Fan.The fan functions like a regular ceiling fan under normal conditions and does not interfere with daily usage. However, it is equipped with a smart safety mechanism that detects abnormal or sudden excess weight. The system uses a shock-up spring for weight detection and a limit switch that gets activated when unusual load is applied. Once triggered, the limit switch sends a signal to an alarm system, and a contactor holds the switch continuously until it is manually reset.For automated communication and emergency alerts, the device uses Arduino Uno and a GSM module. As soon as the Arduino receives a signal from the limit switch, the GSM module immediately sends an alert message to pre-authorized phone numbers and then places repeated phone calls at every five-second interval. This ensures that wardens, parents, or concerned authorities are informed without delay. Importantly, the system works without alerting other students and does not break or damage the fan.The Suicide Saviour Fan is designed to be compatible with existing hostel infrastructure, making it suitable for mass installation. It is cost-effective, requires minimal maintenance, and operates silently, appearing no different from a normal ceiling fan while serving as a life-saving device in moments of crisis.Anuska has submitted her invention for patent registration to Intellectual Property India, which, after verification, has officially published the application. This recognition marks a significant achievement for a school student innovator.She comes from a family with a strong academic and scientific background. Her father, Dr. Shyam Sundar Nandi, is a scientist, while her mother, Sanchita Nandi, was earlier a lecturer at a Central Railway Junior college and has currently taken a break from work to focus on her daughter’s education.Both parents have expressed immense pride in Anuska’s work. Dr. Nandi says his daughter has always wanted to do something different and has consistently participated in school-level and international science competitions, winning several awards.Her mother Sanchita says she feels proud that Anuska has created an invention that could help prevent suicides among young and intelligent students in premier institutions like IITs and other leading institutes across the country.The entire device was developed within the school premises with support from the physics faculty. Anuska independently developed the idea and technology, while the school provided continuous encouragement. She has especially acknowledged the help of assistant lab assistant Prakash Mahajan, who supported her by arranging the required materials for building the device. Anuska also said that the B. K. Birla Public School management, especially Principal Ranjana Jangra and her teacher Suman Iyer, constantly inspires students to think innovatively and do something new, and she credited their encouragement and support as an important factor behind her innovation.Educators, parents, and social activists during recent science exhibition at school when Anushka revealed about her innovation welcomed the Suicide Saviour Fan and have called upon educational authorities, hostel administrators, and coaching institutes to consider piloting and adopting the innovation.If implemented on a larger scale, the device could become a standard safety feature in student accommodations.From a school laboratory in Kalyan, Anuska Nandi’s innovation stands as a powerful reminder that age is no barrier to meaningful change. As India continues to face serious student mental health challenges, the Suicide Saviour Fan offers a ray of hope, showing how empathy and science together can help save lives.","Anuska Nandi, a 15-year-old Class 10 student of B.

It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

Evidence of ancient microbial activity found in Namibian Desert rock formations

Erosion alone does not fit

Signs pointing toward biological activity

What kind of organisms could do this

Deserts hide unexpected histories

This matters for Earth and beyond





In some of the driest parts of southern Africa, rock faces hold quiet records of much older worlds. Marble and limestone formations, shaped long before today’s deserts formed, often preserve signs of shifting climates and slow geological stress. Most markings fit within known patterns of erosion or mineral change. But in scattered outcrops across Namibia and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, researchers have noticed something that sits uneasily with those explanations. Fine, repeated tunnels run through the stone in tight, parallel lines. They follow fractures but extend beyond them, cutting into solid rock. Their shape is controlled, their spacing consistent. These features appear old, inactive, and difficult to explain. They point to processes that do not operate in these environments today.The structures have been identified in desert regions of Namibia, Oman and Saudi Arabia. In Namibia, they are found in Neoproterozoic marble exposed along river valleys and plateaus far from the coast. Similar features occur in limestone formations across the Arabian Peninsula.The common factor is geological stability. These rocks have not been heavily deformed for hundreds of millions of years.The tunnels appear as bands rather than isolated holes. Each band can extend for metres, sometimes following a fracture before fading back into intact stone. Individual tunnels are small, less than a millimetre wide and only a few centimetres long. They are always aligned. They do not cross or branch randomly. This regularity is one of the details that drew attention in the field.At first glance, weathering seems an obvious explanation. Desert rocks often show pitting, flaking and chemical alteration. But these tunnels behave differently. They cut across mineral layers without disturbing them. In many cases, the original colour banding of the marble remains visible along the tunnel walls, suggesting material was removed rather than replaced.Typical karst processes produce irregular cavities and widened fractures. Crystallisation leaves angular patterns. Tectonic stress creates breaks, not fine parallel tubes. None of these processes produce tightly packed, evenly spaced borings that stop at similar depths. The geometry looks controlled, not accidental.Researchers of the article “Subfossil Fracture-Related Euendolithic Micro-burrows in Marble and Limestone” did a closer analysis that adds weight to a biological explanation. The tunnels are often filled with fine white calcite that contrasts with the host rock. Chemical testing shows that this infill is depleted in several elements compared to the surrounding stone. Along the tunnel edges, researchers have detected thin rims enriched in phosphorus and sulphur.Microscopy and spectroscopy reveal traces of degraded biological material. Carbon isotope values also fall within ranges associated with life. DNA and proteins are no longer present, which is not surprising given the age. But the chemical fingerprints remain. Together, they suggest that microorganisms once bored into the rock while alive, then left behind altered mineral chemistry when conditions changed.Endolithic microbes are known to live inside rocks in extreme environments. Some occupy cracks. Others actively dissolve minerals to create space. These organisms are found in places such as Antarctica and the Atacama Desert, where surface conditions are harsh but rock interiors offer protection.The newly described tunnels resemble endolithic activity, where microbes bore directly into carbonate rock. What's unusual is the scale and organisation. The tunnels form long bands with consistent orientation, suggesting a shared growth direction or environmental trigger. No known modern organism produces exactly this pattern. It remains unclear whether the responsible microbes still exist or are extinct.Today, the regions where these tunnels occur are hyperarid. Rain is rare. Biological activity is limited. Yet the tunnels imply conditions that once allowed sustained microbial life within the rock. That does not require lush landscapes, but it does suggest a different balance of moisture and chemistry.Because deserts preserve surfaces with little disturbance, they can lock in evidence that would be erased elsewhere. Features formed deep inside rock masses can later be exposed by erosion, appearing almost out of place in the modern climate.Carbonate rocks hold most of Earth’s carbon. Understanding how life interacts with them matters for models of the global carbon cycle. Even small biological effects, repeated over large areas and long times, can shift carbon between solid rock and the environment.These findings also matter beyond Earth. Similar carbonate rocks exist on Mars. If microbes once lived inside them, their traces might look subtle and unfamiliar. The tunnels in Namibia and Arabia show that life can leave marks that do not resemble fossils in the usual sense.The bands end quietly in fractures. There is no clear start or finish. Just traces, cut into stone, waiting to be noticed.","Mysterious ancient life found in tunnels of Africa and Arabia leave scientists searching for answers.

Discovered beneath Nevşehir Castle

How researchers are estimating its true size

What daily life looked like below ground

What the future holds for these underground cities





Beneath familiar landscapes, traces of everyday life sometimes survive in places few expect to find them. Across parts of the world, tunnels, chambers and stairways cut into rock show that living underground was once a practical choice, not a novelty. These spaces were not temporary shelters or isolated caves. They were planned environments where people cooked, stored food, worshipped and waited out danger. Many underground passages promoted today as lost cities are little more than mines or short refuges. A smaller number, however, were full habitations used over generations. In central Turkey, one This discovery is reshaping our understanding of how entire communities adapted to conflict and climate. Communities adapted to conflict and climate. The remains lie beneath modern streets, largely unseen, yet carefully organised for life below ground.The most extensive underground settlements known today are found in the Cappadocia region of central Turkey. The area is shaped by thick layers of volcanic ash rock, known as tuff, which is soft enough to carve but strong enough to hold its form. Over centuries, local communities cut rooms, corridors and shafts deep into this material.According to National Geographic , archaeologists have documented at least 36 underground cities across Cappadocia. Some were small refuges. Others expanded into multi-level complexes. The best known, Derinkuyu, reaches around 85 metres below the surface and includes living quarters, kitchens, storage rooms, chapels and ventilation shafts.Life underground offered protection. Cappadocia sat at the crossroads of empires, religions and trade routes. Invasions were frequent. When danger approached, residents could retreat below ground, seal entrances with heavy stone doors and survive for weeks or months.The underground cities were designed for this purpose. Narrow tunnels limited movement. Air shafts supplied fresh oxygen. Water channels connected to wells. Livestock were sometimes kept inside, adding warmth and food but also requiring careful ventilation.In 2013, a housing development near a Byzantine-era castle in Nevşehir revealed hidden entrances to a previously unknown underground settlement. Construction stopped, and archaeologists were called in. What they found was far larger than expected.Beneath the hilltop castle lay a network of rooms and tunnels stretching across several kilometres. Early surveys suggest the complex may rival or even exceed Derinkuyu in size. Artefacts, including ceramics, stone crosses and grinding tools, point to long-term use from Byzantine times through the Ottoman period.Geophysicists from Nevşehir University conducted detailed surveys using resistivity and seismic imaging. These methods allow scientists to map voids in rock without excavation. According to dozens of measurements, the underground city covers nearly five million square feet. Some corridors may reach depths of more than 110 metres. If confirmed, this would make the site one of the deepest known underground habitations. Researchers caution that much remains unexplored, and fragile rock conditions slow progress.The layout suggests a self-sustaining community. There are signs of kitchens, wineries and linseed presses used to produce oil for lamps. Chapels indicate regular religious practice. Storage rooms would have held grain and dried foods.Living underground was likely dark and crowded. Yet these spaces were carefully planned, not improvised. Over time, residents refined the design, expanding rooms and improving airflow. The cities were not hidden forever. People returned to the surface when threats passed.Cappadocia adopted Christianity early. By the fourth century, its bishops held influence within the Byzantine Empire. This religious identity made the region a target during centuries of conflict over Anatolia. Muslim forces arrived in the late eighth century. Later came the Seljuk Turks, followed by Ottoman rule. Through each shift, underground cities provided continuity. They allowed communities to endure without constant rebuilding or flight.Local authorities see cultural and economic potential. Plans include opening sections of the Nevşehir site to the public and developing museums and walking routes. There are also proposals for above-ground tourism facilities. Archaeologists remain cautious. Excavation carries risks, as the soft tuff can collapse. Work continues slowly, clearing rubble and documenting spaces as they emerge. Each chamber adds another detail to a long, quiet record of people who once lived beneath the earth, not as legend, but as routine.","Turkey’s Cappadocia region contains dozens of fully developed underground cities.

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

What is Ejari in Dubai? Why expats can face rental trouble and legal visa issues without it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-ejari-in-dubai-why-expats-can-face-rental-trouble-and-legal-visa-issues-without-it/articleshow/127372648.cms,"New expats in Dubai face major hurdles if their rent isn’t Ejari-registered / AI Image

What is Ejari in Dubai?

What can go wrong without Ejari?

You cannot activate electricity or water through DEWA without an Ejari number.

Immigration authorities require it for your residency visa and for sponsoring family members.

and for sponsoring family members. Telecom providers like Etisalat and Du use it to verify your home address.

If your landlord tries to raise the rent illegally or evict you without notice, the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre (RDSC) will only hear your case if you have a registered Ejari.

Common mistakes among expats

If the landlord doesn’t register Ejari promptly, tenants can be stuck without utilities.

In shared homes or co-living setups, all occupants must be declared on Ejari; failure to do so can cause service issues or legal complications.

Some rentals are wrongly uploaded as “rented” in the system, blocking new Ejari registrations until previous records are cleared.





For thousands of expats arriving in Dubai this month, the hunt for the perfect home is the first major hurdle. However, a wave of sophisticated rental scams emerged in early 2026, targeting newcomers who are eager to secure housing quickly. Fraudsters are increasingly posing as legitimate agents or owners, offering luxury apartments at below-market rates to lure in unsuspecting tenants.These ""phantom landlords"" often present official-looking contracts but intentionally skip the most crucial step: Ejari registration. Without this government-verified document, a tenant has no legal standing, making them vulnerable to ""double-leasing"" (where the same unit is rented to multiple people) or vanishing ""agents"" who pocket the deposit and disappear.Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), designed to digitally record every tenancy contract. Until that registration is complete, a lease is effectively invisible to authorities and vendors.Ejari transforms a private agreement into a legally binding document recognized by the state. Beyond just proving you live there, this certificate is the ""master key"" required to unlock almost every essential service in the city.Without a valid Ejari, new expats find themselves stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, unable to complete basic tasks that are vital for settling into their new lives.George (not his real name) arrived in Dubai, found an apartment, signed a lease, paid his deposit, but skipped Ejari registration. Almost immediately, he ran into problems: DEWA (electricity/water authority) blocked his applications. Telecom companies wouldn’t connect broadband. Visa-related processes stalled. Verification of his address couldn’t proceed. Without the Ejari certificate, nothing worked.This isn’t rare, dozens of renters share similar experiences online where utilities, government services and official procedures are halted without Ejari. Registration isn’t just bureaucratic formality; it’s a legal gateway for life in Dubai.Key issues when Ejari is missing:One major confusion stems from the belief that a signed tenancy contract alone is enough. In fact, it’s not, only once a contract is uploaded and approved in Ejari is it formally recognised by authorities, courts, and service providers.Another frequent issue is who handles registration. By law, landlords are responsible, but in practice many tenants end up doing it themselves or paying agents or typing centres to process the paperwork. Without clarity on who manages Ejari, delays often occur.Here’s why that matters:The impact of following these regulations is peace of mind. By insisting on an Ejari-registered contract, expats ensure they are part of a regulated, transparent ecosystem. It prevents the heartbreak of ""rental ghosting"" and ensures that the thousands of dirhams spent on deposits and rent are protected by UAE law.As Dubai continues to grow, these digital safeguards are designed to make the city one of the most secure rental markets in the world, provided that tenants take that final, 30-minute step to make their contract official.","Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency.

Evidence of reuse under later rulers

What the discovery adds to Egyptian history





Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years, offering a detailed look at daily life during one of ancient Egypt’s most powerful periods. The settlement was built under Pharaoh Amenhotep III and later inherited by his son Akhenaten, whose radical religious reforms reshaped Egyptian history. Found within the ancient capital of Thebes, the site includes homes, workshops, administrative buildings and burial areas, many preserved to an unusual degree. Officials described it in 2021 as the “lost golden city of Luxor”, pointing to its scale and condition rather than any single monument. The discovery adds context to a period marked by wealth, upheaval and a sudden break with long-held tradition. National Geographic mentions excavation revealed a dense urban area enclosed by mudbrick walls that in places rise to around nine feet. Inside, rooms were filled with everyday objects left where they were last used. Pottery vessels, tools and food remains suggested the city was active and organised, rather than ceremonial alone.Some buildings appeared domestic, while others showed signs of planning and record keeping. Archaeologists also identified streets and defined neighbourhoods, hinting at a carefully managed royal settlement rather than a temporary camp.Amenhotep III ruled during the 18th dynasty, a time associated with strong diplomacy, vast resources and ambitious building projects. His court oversaw temples, statues and palaces across Egypt. The newly uncovered city appears to have supported this activity, functioning as an industrial and administrative centre linked to the wider capital at Thebes. Items related to metal and glass production were found, alongside evidence of large scale food preparation. This supports long-held views of Amenhotep III’s reign as one of stability and excess, built on a complex labour system.After Amenhotep III’s death, his son Akhenaten took a sharply different path. He rejected Egypt’s traditional gods in favour of a single sun deity, Aten, and moved the royal court to a new city called Akhetaten, now known as Amarna. The discovery near Luxor suggests Akhenaten inherited a functioning and productive city, raising questions about why he chose to abandon Thebes altogether. Archaeologists believe the settlement was active during the early years of his rule, before being partially left behind as power shifted north.One of the most striking aspects of the site was the amount of material linked to ordinary labour. A bakery and kitchen complex was identified, with large ovens and storage jars. Other areas showed traces of workshops used for jewellery, metal tools and decorative objects. These findings help balance the historical record, which often focuses on kings and temples rather than workers and craftspeople. The layout suggests people lived close to where they worked, within a tightly organised royal economy.The city did not vanish immediately after Akhenaten’s reign. Archaeologists found signs that it was reused during the time of Tutankhamun, who restored traditional religion and ruled from Memphis rather than Thebes or Amarna. Objects from later periods suggested continued, though reduced, activity. Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamun, may also have made use of the site. Layers of occupation showed that parts of the settlement remained in use well into the Coptic Byzantine era before finally being covered by sand.The importance of the site lies less in spectacle and more in detail. Its preservation allows archaeologists to study how a royal city functioned at ground level. It also provides context for one of Egypt’s most dramatic political and religious shifts. Rather than viewing Akhenaten’s reforms in isolation, researchers can now place them against the backdrop of a thriving urban centre he chose to leave behind. The city near Luxor does not answer every question, but it quietly fills gaps in a long and complicated story.","Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years. The settlement was built under Pharaoh Amenhotep III and later inherited by his son Akhenaten.

Early American settlers may have come from Japan: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/early-american-settlers-may-have-come-from-japan-study/articleshow/127301808.cms,"New evidence ties the first American’s stone tools to ancient Japan

Researchers are revisiting the idea of an American Upper Palaeolithic for several reasons

How northeast Asia fits into the picture

The first Americans could have come by the coast

Why inland routes leave unanswered questions

What the early dates across North America suggest

Why the story remains open





Archaeologists have spent decades debating how and when people first entered the Americas. The outlines are familiar, but the details keep shifting. A growing body of evidence now suggests that the earliest populations arrived earlier than once believed and brought with them a shared way of making stone tools. This emerging picture is based not on a single site or dramatic find, but on patterns seen across tool assemblages dated to before about 13,500 years ago. Researchers argue these tools belong to a broader technological tradition with roots in Northeast Asia. The idea does not settle old arguments, but it does change where many are now looking. Instead of focusing only on land bridges, attention is drifting towards coastlines, islands, and older connections that are harder to trace.Across North America, several early sites show similar approaches to making tools. These assemblages often combine two methods. One uses cores shaped to strike long blades. The other relies on carefully flaked bifaces shaped from both sides. These methods were sometimes used together, producing small projectile points with refined forms.While the finished tools vary from place to place, the underlying process looks familiar.Blades were used as cutting tools or reshaped into scrapers and points. Bifacial tools produced flakes that were also put to use. This shared logic suggests knowledge passed along, rather than isolated experiments.The study “Characterising the American Upper Palaeolithic” refers to these assemblages as part of an American Upper Palaeolithic. The term has been controversial, especially when applied outside Europe. Still, supporters argue it helps place early American tools within a wider global context. The same dual-blade and biface techniques appear across much of Eurasia during the Late Upper Palaeolithic. Seeing similar choices in early American sites suggests a connection that is technological rather than symbolic. It points to learnt practices carried by people moving across regions, adapting but not starting from scratch.Comparable stone tool traditions appear in Northeast Asia, including northern Japan, around 20,000 years ago. Sites there show elongated blade production alongside bifacial points with similar cross sections and shaping strategies.Researchers note that some of these Asian points share specific design features with early American examples. This does not mean they are identical, but the resemblance is close enough to raise questions about shared origins. It suggests that the ancestors of the first Americans were part of a broader population already using these methods.Genetic studies suggest that the founding population of the Americas formed in northeast Asia around 25,000 years ago. After a long period of isolation, this group expanded into the Americas sometime after 20,000 years ago. Where that isolation happened remains unclear. One proposal places it in the Paleo Sakhalin-Hokkaido-Kuril region. During the last glacial maximum, lower sea levels connected these areas into a long peninsula. People living there would have had access to rich coastal resources and island chains. From this setting, a gradual movement along the Pacific coast becomes plausible, even likely.The traditional land bridge route through Beringia has gaps that are hard to ignore. Few archaeological sites from the last glacial maximum have been found there. Glacial conditions would have made long stays difficult. In contrast, coastal routes leave fewer traces, especially with rising sea levels since the ice age. Campsites and travel corridors may now be underwater. This absence of evidence does not confirm the coastal model, but it does make it harder to dismiss.Some pre-Clovis sites across North America date to between 18,000 and 13,500 years ago, with claims of even earlier presence. The widespread nature of these sites implies time for movement and adaptation. If people were already dispersed across large areas by 16,000 years ago, their arrival must have begun earlier. Stone tools alone cannot give a full answer, but they provide one of the few durable records left behind.Despite growing support, many questions remain. Not all sites are accepted. Tool styles vary. Genetic data still lacks geographic precision. The proposed homeland in northern Japan or nearby regions is plausible but not proven. What is changing is the tone of the discussion. The old certainty has softened. In its place is a quieter recognition that the first Americans may have come by less obvious paths, carrying traditions shaped long before they reached a new continent.",New evidence ties the first American’s stone tools to ancient Japan.

Japan’s underwater crop circles mystery turns out to be a mating signal of this small fish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japans-underwater-crop-circles-mystery-turns-out-to-be-a-mating-signal-of-this-small-fish/articleshow/127275653.cms,"The strange seabed circles off Japan were built by a fish

The pufferfish constructs the circular nest

The structure matters for mating

The nests are built only once

What fluid experiments reveal about water flow

Why the discovery matters beyond curiosity





Shapes that appear out of place have long been present on the seabed off southern Japan. In the 1990s, divers near Amami Oshima Island noticed huge, artificially-looking circular designs carved into the sand. They came and went every year, leaving only curiosity in their wake. There was no definitive explanation for a long time. Currents in the ocean didn't fit. Geological processes were inadequate. The source, a tiny marine fish diligently working close to the ocean floor, wasn't discovered until much later. These buildings are meticulously constructed nests rather than natural accidents, according to research released in the last ten years. The finding reinterpreted the circles, transforming a silent puzzle of the seabed into a narrative about behaviour, effort, and reproduction.The circles appear on flat sandy seabeds at depths of around 25 metres. They can reach two metres across and are marked by ridges and grooves that radiate from a smooth central area. The pattern looks deliberate, almost decorative.For years, divers referred to them as mystery circles. They appeared fully formed and then slowly disappeared as currents smoothed the sand.No one saw them being made.The builder is a small male pufferfish from the genus Torquigener. Measuring roughly ten centimetres long, it looks unremarkable compared with the scale of the structures. Yet the fish uses its fins with precision, shaping sand grain by grain. This behaviour was first directly observed in 2011, solving a puzzle that had lasted more than a decade.Construction takes about a week. The male begins by marking out a rough circle, swimming back and forth to dig shallow valleys. These runs form ridges and grooves arranged like spokes. As the structure develops, the fish focuses on the centre, flattening it and collecting fine sand. In the final stage, it decorates the ridges with shell fragments and coral pieces, taken from nearby.The nest plays a role in female choice. Females only visit when the structure is complete. When one approaches, the male stirs fine sand into the water, creating a visual display. Eggs are laid in the central zone, where conditions are calmer. Studies suggest the shape of the nest helps gather fine particles and reduces water flow, creating a more stable place for eggs to develop.After spawning, the male guards the eggs for several days. During this time, the structure is not maintained. Currents gradually flatten the ridges and wash away the fine sand. Once the eggs hatch, the male leaves and does not return. Instead of repairing the old nest, it builds a new one elsewhere. Researchers believe the loss of fine sand makes reuse inefficient.To understand how the nest works, scientists tested scaled models in flowing water. The results showed that water slows in the central area while moving differently through the valleys. This reduction in current speed, measured at over 20%, likely protects eggs. It also explains why fine sand gathers in the middle rather than being swept away.The pufferfish circles add to evidence that sexual selection can drive complex construction behaviour in fish. While such traits are well studied in birds and insects, fewer examples exist underwater. Here, the structure serves both as a signal and a functional shelter. It is built at a high cost, abandoned quickly, and repeated cycle after cycle.On the seabed, the circles come and go. Above them, the ocean looks unchanged.","The pufferfish is a small male from the genus Torquigener. It uses its fins with precision, shaping sand grain by grain.

How Finnish research moved wireless power beyond the laboratory

Why wireless electricity cannot yet replace traditional power grids





Finland is slowly making a name for itself as an innovator, albeit a low-key one, regarding wireless electricity transmission, which aims to transmit power via the airwaves without having to use cables, sockets, or connectors. Although the concept remains more than a little exotic-sounding, scientists from Finland are slowly but surely pushing the boundaries of said technology via experimental research. Although it promises nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that would result in an electrical paradigm shift regarding the transmission of electricity, it does offer insights into how this realm of technology would develop for various applications in the forthcoming years.Wireless charging involves the use of electromagnetic fields. The idea is quite straightforward. It involves the transmission of electrical charges using electromagnetic fields. This is similar to wireless communication. The only difference is that the wireless communication involves the use of Wi-Fi. The Finnish engineers were interested in using resonant coupling. The other idea they were interested in is magnetic induction.The idea involves the use of electromagnetic waves. The waves can only work if the systems are set on the same frequency.Much of this is based on existing understanding in the fields of inductive power transmission and magnetic resonance. Finnish universities have been conducting research to develop these concepts, particularly on ways to reduce energy transmission losses. Research conducted at universities such as Aalto and Helsinki has contributed to the establishment of theoretical underpinnings and practical approaches for improving the efficiency and stability of wireless power transmission.According to the University of Helsinki research, magnetic loop antennas could transmit power wirelessly with relatively high efficiency across limited distances. These findings offered valuable insight into how transmitter and receiver designs influence performance, and how coupling strength can be optimised. Such work has informed later experiments, allowing researchers to move beyond basic proofs of concept.More recent demonstrations by Finnish research teams, reported in international technology coverage, have shown small electronic devices being powered through the air. Although modest in scale, these experiments suggest the technology is no longer confined to isolated laboratory conditions. Public demonstrations and shared test results indicate a gradual shift towards more realistic scenarios, even if commercial use remains some way off.Despite the progress, experts are clear that wireless power transfer currently works best over short ranges and at relatively low power levels. It is most suitable for charging small electronics, sensors, or robotic systems in controlled environments. Performance drops sharply as distance increases, and systems often require specialised receivers and finely tuned electromagnetic fields to function reliably.Finnish scientists are also researching how wireless power would work when exposed to real-world settings. The research has already focused on how human tissue responds to the fields when charging wirelessly, which is important for future applications in medical products such as implants and other devices that might be charged without surgery.Although the research carried out by Finland is definitely indicative of scientific progress, it is anything but indicative of the upcoming substitution of the classical grids. The transportation of high-power energy through wireless technology is set to continue to require the use of infrastructure, at least within the foreseeable future.Industry experts also report that consumer acceptance of wireless power on a mass scale for homes, cars, and even cities will take many years of further research and development. For the time being, however, the Finnish development of wireless power indicates that the interest from around the world is not just for wireless electricity but also something that will supplement traditional power sources. The best use of wireless power actually lies in specialized areas where cables are not feasible.","Finnish scientists are pushing the boundaries of wireless power.

Fines for neglect



Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences.

Reality behind the snow





Imagine waking up, looking out your window in Dubai, and seeing the Burj Khalifa draped in a blanket of fresh, powdery snow.

The caption by His Highness, “how the weather will feel tomorrow,” was a cheeky nod to the freezing winds currently whistling through the city's glass towers.While we aren't exactly skiing down Sheikh Zayed Road just yet, the ""Real Feel"" temperature in the UAE is getting pretty close to the vision shared by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan. This week, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported that the mercury hit a bone-chilling 0.2°C on Jebel Jais.For a city built for 45°C summers, this cold snap has changed the way we live:The viral image itself is a masterclass in digital art, likely utilizing AI or high-level editing to show the world what Dubai would look like as a Nordic capital.It’s part of a larger trend where His Highness Sheikh Hamdan uses his platform to highlight the beauty and seasonal shifts of the city in a fun, relatable way.However, the weather scientists at the NCM remind us that while the photo is a fantasy, the Siberian High Pressure system is very real.

What are UAE drivers seeing? Fake “DARB alerts”



A supposed payment link with a web URL that looks official at first glance

A prompt to “Reply Y” to open a payment portal

A claimed overdue toll amount

The sender phone number was not from a UAE mobile network

The links did not use official government or Q Mobility domains

Recipients often reported they had no actual pending tolls

Official advice: Trust only Q Mobility’s approved channels



The official DARB App

The Darb website: darb.qmobility.ae

Approved government platforms such as TAMM

Any message that arrives from a random phone number, especially from an international code, should be treated as suspicious.

Why this UAE toll scam is on the rise

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts.

Special medical considerations for Ramadan 2026



Bottom line: Opt for a balanced, informed approach this Ramadan 2026







As Ramadan 2026 nears, millions around the world are preparing not only spiritually but physically for a month of dawn-to-sunset fasting. While fasting is a beloved religious observance, health experts emphasise that preparation and smart nutrition are crucial to maintaining wellbeing throughout the month. Combining insights from local doctors and reputable global health organisations, here is a trusted guide to help you fast safely and comfortably.Adequate hydration is one of the most important components of a successful fast. The World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office specifically recommends drinking plenty of water (at least around 10 glasses) and eating hydrating foods such as soups and fresh fruits like watermelon and salads during non-fasting hours to compensate for fluids lost during the day. They also advise avoiding caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola because caffeine increases urination and can lead to dehydration.Cornell Health, the health and wellbeing service of Cornell University, echoes this and adds that one should drink fluids at regular intervals through the night and avoid consuming too much at once, as over-hydration in one go can dilute electrolytes.Skipping the pre-dawn meal (suhoor) can make fasting significantly harder.Nutrition experts from Cornell Health advise that suhoor should include a mix of whole grains, protein, healthy fats and fruits or vegetables to help sustain energy and keep blood sugar stable throughout the long fast. Examples include whole-grain cereals or toast with eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or brown rice with vegetables.The WHO also recommends that suhoor be light but nutritious, particularly for groups who may be more vulnerable during fasting such as elderly adults, adolescents, pregnant or nursing women.Both WHO and international dietary guides emphasise the benefits of starting iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) with water and dates, a longstanding tradition rooted in health as well as faith. Dates provide natural sugars and a small energy boost while water immediately begins rehydrating the body after prolonged abstinence.This approach is supported by general Ramadan nutrition advice from organisations such as Fraser Health in Canada, which notes that dates and low-fat milk are a healthy way to break the fast and can help prevent abrupt blood sugar fluctuations that contribute to fatigue.Healthline, a respected medical and nutrition information site, recommends leaning into whole foods rich in fiber, lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates during iftar to replenish nutrients lost during the day and provide lasting energy through the night and into the next fast. Examples include vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, legumes and dairy.Their registered dietitians also emphasise moderation, eating mindfully at iftar and avoiding heavy, sugary, or high-fat foods that can cause indigestion and fatigue. Starting with water and a small date or fruit before main dishes helps control appetite and prevent overeating.Several health authorities recommend reducing caffeine intake in the week leading up to Ramadan. Research and expert advice from wellness organisations suggest that sudden withdrawal from habitual caffeine can lead to headaches and fatigue, symptoms many people misattribute to fasting itself. Gradually tapering coffee and tea before Ramadan can help your body avoid these issues once fasting begins.Moreover, WHO guidance clearly states avoiding caffeine during suhoor and non-fasting periods because it increases urine output and can exacerbate dehydration, something you want to minimise before long fasting hours.WHO and other health organisations encourage a balanced diet throughout Ramadan, composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and sufficient fluids, while limiting deep-fried, processed or high-sugar foods that contribute little nutrition and can lead to discomfort or weight gain.This aligns with Cornell Health’s advice on maintaining good nutrition: including vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins at both suhoor and iftar to help manage hunger, energy levels, and overall health during the fast.While Ramadan is not usually a time for intense workouts during fasting hours, light movement and gentle exercise in the evening, such as walking or stretching, can support digestion and circulation, according to health advisors. Framing this within a balanced lifestyle helps preserve energy without risking dehydration or exhaustion.Sleep hygiene is also important because altered timetables can disrupt normal sleep cycles during Ramadan. Experts advise aiming for adequate rest (7–8 hours if possible) by incorporating naps and consistent sleeping schedules into your routine, which supports physical recovery throughout the fasting month.International health bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and dietetics professionals often emphasise that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or those on specific medications should consult a healthcare provider before fasting. Adjustments to meal timing, medication schedules and monitoring plans ensure safety and prevent complications.This is particularly relevant for individuals whose medical treatments require food or water intake at specific times and cannot be adjusted without professional supervision.Preparing your body for Ramadan fasting is not just about abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours. It is about planning smartly, hydrating fully, eating nutrient-dense meals and respecting your body’s needs. Strategies backed by the World Health Organization, Cornell Health and other recognised health authorities affirm that with proper preparation, most people can experience a safe, comfortable and fulfilling Ramadan.By following these evidence-based tips, from hydration and meal composition to rest and medical consultation, you can approach the holy month with both spiritual intention and physical wellbeing.",Ramadan 2026: Are You Ready to Fast Safely?

In January 2026, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) unveiled a milestone in sustainable transport: the arrival and imminent deployment of Zhongtong electric buses capable of operating up to 280 kilometres on a single charge on urban routes. This development, part of a 735-bus procurement plan that includes 40 electric units, marks one of the largest and most advanced electric public-bus deployments in the UAE to date. It reflects Dubai’s accelerating commitment to zero-emission mobility and its broader climate strategy for 2050.At the heart of this initiative is the Zhongtong electric bus, a 12-metre, custom-designed vehicle tailored to Dubai’s climate and operational conditions. Powered by a 434 kWh battery and supported by 360 kW ABB fast chargers, the buses can cover daily routes without having to return to depots for recharging. That 280 km range on a single charge is a major leap for electric public buses in the region, where high temperatures and intensive daily service patterns have previously limited operational efficiency.This deployment makes Dubai one of the first Gulf cities to run electric buses at this scale, with enhanced range and performance that can sustain an entire day’s worth of urban service before needing replenishment.The Zhongtong buses are not a standalone effort. They form a part of the RTA’s Zero-Emission Public Transport Strategy 2050, which aims to transform Dubai’s transit network into a fully zero-emission system by mid-century. Under this strategy, the goal is for all public buses, taxis and limousine services to run on electric or hydrogen power by 2050, supporting wider national climate objectives, including climate neutrality and carbon-footprint reduction.","The Zhongtong electric bus is the first of its type to be operated on Dubai’s urban routes.

Check around you before stepping out: Look under seats and door pockets.

Dubai’s Lost & Found: A model for smart cities







Dubai’s famous taxis are not just fast and reliable, they are also a magnet for forgotten belongings. According to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), passengers left behind a staggering 104,162 items in taxis across the Emirate during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record as drivers and the RTA worked to reunite commuters with their lost property.From wallets stuffed with cash to passports and gadgets, the range of forgotten items reflects the hustle of everyday life in Dubai and the efficiency of a system designed to ensure that lost does not have to mean gone forever. Here’s a closer look at what riders forgot most and how Dubai’s smart mobility network brought them back.The lost and found numbers from RTA reveal that Dubai riders were not just leaving behind the occasional umbrella or pair of sunglasses, they were dropping valuable and essential items after rides. Over AED 2 million in cash was handed into the Lost & Found team in 2025, alongside a flood of high-tech devices and personal documents.Here’s a snapshot of what riders left behind:These figures highlight just how often commuters hustle out of taxis without double-checking pockets, bags or seat areas, perhaps rushed by work, social plans or caregiving duties. The sheer volume also underscores the importance of Dubai’s lost-item recovery infrastructure.The Dubai RTA did not just log these reports; it made getting items back surprisingly smooth for riders. RTA’s system is built around swift communication, detailed tracking and cooperation between call center teams, drivers and taxi companies, often resulting in a recovery within two hours of the initial report.Meera Al Shaikh, Director of Customer Happiness at the RTA, explained that the lost property framework strengthens trust in Dubai’s mobility ecosystem, raising satisfaction not just for journeys but for what passengers take with them afterward.The reporting process itself is multilingual and highly accessible. Passengers can report lost items through:Services are offered in Arabic, English, Hindi, Filipino, French, Chinese, Russian and more, reflecting Dubai’s highly diverse population and making it easy for tourists, residents and workers alike to submit a lost item claim with minimal friction.Being distracted, juggling bags or stepping out in a hurry are everyday occurrences but in a city like Dubai, where taxi trips can be short and frequent, these moments add up to a significant number of forgotten belongings. Unlike many other global cities where lost items may never be reunited with their owners, Dubai’s approach has become a benchmark for urban mobility services.However, it is not just about numbers. The system empowers riders to reclaim valuables quickly and securely. Identity verification protects passengers’ privacy and integrated tracking technologies ensure swift communication with drivers once an item is reported.The RTA’s Lost & Found team reported over 30 messages of gratitude from riders in 2025 alone, a small but telling indicator of how these efforts improve everyday life for commuters across the city.Even with an efficient recovery system in place, prevention is always better than reclamation. Common taxi riders in Dubai and beyond often leave behind items like smartphones, wallets and keys simply because they’re thinking about their next stop. Research from ride-hailing lost property indexes elsewhere suggests items like glasses, bags and even wedding rings sometimes get left behind when commuters rush between meetings or errands.Here are practical tips to reduce that “oops” moment:What if something does get left behind? Filing a report via the RTA call centre or app quickly is the best way to get that item back while the taxi is still nearby.Dubai’s experience with lost items in taxis is not just about forgetfulness, it is a testament to how smart city infrastructure, responsive government services and community cooperation can turn everyday problems into positive outcomes. Where some cities struggle to reunite lost property with owners, Dubai’s integrated approach, supported by multicultural service channels and tech-enabled systems, sets a high bar.Indeed, the success of the lost property framework complements other facets of Dubai’s transportation vision, which includes expanding digital taxi fleets and enhancing connectivity for residents and visitors alike. Whether it is reconnecting a commuter with their passport or returning a laptop they thought was long gone, Dubai’s taxi Lost & Found system is proving that a seamless urban experience includes confidence that what you leave behind can often be found again, fast, safe and with a smile.","Dubai riders left behind 104,162 items in taxis during 2025, prompting one of the city’s busiest Lost & Found seasons on record.

The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true.

""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok.

US Tests ‘Secret’ Weapon In Venezuela: Maduro Aide's Bombshell | ‘Systematic BOMBING Assisted By AI’

Preparing now for prolonged cold conditions





As a severe winter freeze grips the Houston region, anxiety is rising over its effect on power supplies, transport networks, and everyday routines. Prolonged cold is unusual for the city, and freezing temperatures place exceptional pressure on energy infrastructure, increasing the risk of widespread power outages. When electricity fails during extreme cold, the situation becomes more than an inconvenience, exposing households to serious health and safety dangers. Homes can lose heat rapidly, vulnerable residents face a higher risk of hypothermia, and basic necessities become harder to manage. In these conditions, being prepared is critical. Understanding what steps to take during a power cut, how to retain warmth safely and which actions to avoid can help residents protect themselves and their families until temperatures rise and normal services are restored.Houston is used to hot and humid rather than cold climatic conditions while building their homes. In the event that the power goes off during the freeze for Houston residents, the temperature falls dramatically in their homes, which can trigger hypothermia for the elderly, infants, and people suffering from preexisting health problems. The freezing of water supply lines, limited availability of emergency services, and the lack of access to hot meals and reliable communication make matters even worse for Houston residents during the freeze event.The first few minutes after a power outage are crucial. It's good practice to unplug large appliances and sensitive electronics to avoid damage from surges when the electricity comes back on. Leaving one lamp on can serve as an indicator that the power is back. Meanwhile, food safety is of utmost concern: keeping refrigerator and freezer doors closed all the time helps preserve cold temperatures to delay spoilage.Other priorities involve safe lighting. Use battery-powered torches, lanterns or headlamps-instead of candles, which create a serious fire hazard. If indoor temperatures start to drop rapidly and can't be kept safe, consider relocating to a warming centre or staying with friends or family members who still have power, especially for vulnerable individuals.Existing warmth must for this reason be conserved instead of seeking to acquire new warmth in cold conditions characterized by temperatures below the point of freezing. Sealing windows will also help in conserving heat since they are leading causes of loss of heat. This can be achieved by using plastics or even blankets on windows. Textiles such as towels as well as clothing will also help in sealing doors from unwanted drafts.Simple actions like these can help in many ways. Seating ourselves in just one spot in the same room can help in retaining the temperature within our houses. Then again, at night, we should sleep in the warmest spot in bed, covered in bed sheets.Clothing is very important when trying to stay warm during a power outage. This is because wearing many layers helps to retain body heat. This works because many layers have warm air between them. Having many layers is way better than just having a thick garment to put on. Hats, socks, and gloves are very important because there is heat loss through these body components.Another approach that can be adopted in this case is the use of blankets, quilts, or even sleeping bags that will act as an additional insulator. These can be used even when indoors in case heating facilities are unavailable.In extreme cold conditions, it may be tempting to utilize any source of heat that might be made available, however, certain types are extremely hazardous to health. ""Gas cookers, outdoor stoves, or barbecues should never be brought into buildings as they give off carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas that can result in poisoning or death in as little as a few minutes,"" nor should ""portable heaters or a fireplace be left unattended or used while you are sleeping as they can result in fires or give off toxic fumes.Even the burning of non-fireplace materials, coupled with the burning of candles without proper supervision, increases the risk of house fire even more. Response time for emergencies during widespread power outages can be slow, forcing the need for the prevention of power-related issues.Generators can also help deliver some power during an outage, provided they are used appropriately and placed outdoors away from any doors, windows, and vents to avoid any exhaust fumes entering the home.
