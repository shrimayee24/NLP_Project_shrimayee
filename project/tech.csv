Legal Trouble and Assault Allegations Surface



A Role in a Landmark Lawsuit



What Lies Ahead



Sedona Prince , once heralded as one of women’s college basketball’s most compelling voices and talents, was left undrafted in the 2025 WNBA Draft—despite projections that had her going in the late first or early second round.The 6-foot-7 center from Liberty Hill, Texas, just wrapped up her seventh and final year of NCAA eligibility at TCU . She led the Horned Frogs to their first-ever Elite Eight appearance, averaging 17.2 points per game and starting every game during her two seasons with the team. In total, she started 86 of 108 games over a five-year college career that began at Oregon in 2019.Her name wasn’t called during the 38-player draft and she wasn’t among the 16 players invited to attend the live event at The Shed. The only mention came from analysts speculating whether she might be picked.Prince, 24, rose to national attention in 2021 for posting a viral video from inside the NCAA tournament bubble, showing the stark differences between the men’s and women’s training facilities. The video forced the NCAA to launch an independent review and ultimately led to reforms, including the use of “March Madness” branding for women’s basketball and financial units for tournament appearances.Prince's undrafted status comes amid mounting legal troubles and multiple allegations of abuse and assault most of which surfaced publicly in the past year.In January 2025, TCU campus police were called to Prince’s off-campus residence following a domestic altercation between her and a former romantic partner. Both women filed reports alleging they were assaulted during the incident.According to the police report, both sustained “minimal injury.” Prince reportedly had a black eye, while her ex-girlfriend was noted to have bruises on her arms and legs. No charges were filed due to a lack of sufficient evidence. The other woman reportedly signed a nondisclosure agreement.“Campus police responded to a disturbance… after a call from Sedona. She has not been charged with a crime or found guilty of any wrongdoing.” Prince’s attorney, A. Boone Almanza, said at the time.Prince herself denied the accusations through her lawyer, stating that she has never “abused anyone in her life, whether mentally, emotionally or physically.”But this wasn’t the first time her personal relationships had drawn public attention. In 2024, a TikTok user named Olivia Stabile published a multi-part video series alleging emotional and physical abuse during their time together. Stabile claimed Prince had punched her in the chest, shoved her against a wall, and pushed her off the back of a moving ATV before driving away, all during a vacation in Mexico.The series racked up millions of views and spurred intense online backlash. Prince took to social media to defend herself, saying,“I have never abused anybody in my life. That’s not who I am, that’s not what I do, that’s not what I stand for.”Two more women have since come forward with accusations stretching back to earlier in Prince’s college career. According to The Washington Post, one woman, Alyssa Jimmie , accused Prince of sexually assaulting her in 2019 after a date, claiming the athlete locked her in a car and penetrated her with her fingers without consent. Jimmie alleged that Prince said, “I didn’t take [you] out for nothing.”Another woman, identified only as Jane Doe , accused Prince of forcibly kissing her and guiding her hand into sexual contact after a date in 2022, despite repeated resistance. A lawsuit tied to that claim was eventually withdrawn.Though none of the allegations have resulted in criminal charges, the controversy has affected Prince’s reputation. Over 200,000 people signed a petition urging TCU to remove her from the women’s basketball team.Parallel to her career and personal turmoil, Prince has also been a key figure in the fight for college athlete compensation .She is a lead plaintiff in the high-profile antitrust lawsuit known as House v. NCAA, which challenges the NCAA’s long-standing rules restricting athlete earnings. The case could result in a $2.8 billion settlement, reshaping how college athletes are compensated going forward.Prince attended an April 7, 2025, hearing in Oakland, California, where a federal judge heard arguments for final approval of the settlement. Her role in the case is a natural extension of her advocacy roots, particularly following her viral 2021 video that sparked national debate over equity in collegiate athletics.Despite the accolades, exposure, and experience, Prince now faces a deeply uncertain future in professional basketball. Undrafted and under public scrutiny, her next move is unclear.There’s still a possibility that a WNBA team could invite her to a training camp or tryout, though teams may be wary of the legal and PR complications surrounding her. Overseas leagues may offer another route, one often taken by American players who don’t initially make the WNBA cut.Her attorney remains adamant that the allegations against her are rooted in social media clout-chasing rather than fact.“Rather, she has been convicted on social media by people who have attempted to use their relationship with Sedona to attract followers and to build their influencer careers and settle grudges,” Almanza said.As the legal dust settles and public memory shifts, the question for Sedona Prince is whether she can find a court willing to let her play and whether the noise off the court will ever fully quiet down.","Sedona Prince, 24, was left undrafted in the 2025 WNBA Draft.

These are the 3 shows Kylie and Jason Kelce can't stop watching together during quiet nights



Kylie reveals the TV shows she and Jason HAVE to watch together | More Sh*t Monday

Life has taken a heartwarming turn in the Kelce household. Kylie and Jason Kelce have recently welcomed their fourth daughter, expanding their family of five into a joyful clan of six. With the newest addition settling in, the couple is savoring quieter, slower-paced moments at home—something that aligns perfectly with Jason’s post-NFL chapter and Kylie’s need for recovery and rest.Following childbirth, Kylie has been prioritizing self-care, leaning into the healing process while tending to their newborn. Amidst the demands of early motherhood, she and Jason are finding small windows of peace—moments where they can unwind and simply enjoy being together. And like many parents trying to balance life with a newborn, they’ve turned to TV as a way to decompress and reconnect.Jason, having stepped away from his NFL career just last year, is now enjoying the offseason of his media endeavors. With more flexibility in his schedule, he’s able to be present at home, making this transitional time even more special for the family.During a recent episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie opened up about the shows they’ve been watching. Fans were curious, and Kylie didn’t hesitate to share their current watchlist. “We are all caught up on The Great British Bakeoff . I did inform Jason just the other day that we do need to catch up on Taskmaster. It is hilarious and outstanding,” she revealed. Their latest shared favorite, Taskmaster, a British YouTube comedy series, has won them over with its smart humor and binge-worthy format.Kylie also mentioned her recent accomplishment—finishing the iconic sitcom Friends, which took her a while since she mostly played it at bedtime or during household chores. It's one of her “comfort” shows, offering familiarity during this physically and emotionally demanding period. As for what's next, she hinted at diving back into two other beloved sitcoms: Parks and Recreation and New Girl.Jason’s taste diverges a bit—he’s recently started watching HBO’s White Lotus, a critically acclaimed anthological comedy-drama. “Outside of that, Jason is watching some shows at night, I just finished Friends... I think I’m due for either Parks and Rec or New Girl. I think Jason just started watching the new season of White Lotus,” Kylie shared.However, joining Jason for late-night episodes hasn’t been easy for Kylie. Recovering from childbirth and dealing with fatigue, hormonal shifts, and the exhaustion that comes with caring for a newborn, she finds herself unable to focus or stay awake. “Turn-it-on-so-you-can-fall-asleep” shows have become her go-to.While White Lotus may remain a solo watch for Jason for now, Kylie is taking comfort in familiar stories that offer warmth without requiring too much energy—perfect for this beautiful, chaotic season of new beginnings.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce skip coachella without explanation, fueling breakup rumors as insiders blame album obsession","Kylie and Jason Kelce have recently welcomed their fourth daughter.

Mixing ingredients not only results in a variety of unique effects but also adds a layer of excitement and strategy as you aim to cater to the specific tastes of your clientele. While some recipes are well-known, others are hidden gems that offer bizarre or powerful effects. Here, we’ll explore three unique mixing recipes in Schedule 1 that you may not have tried yet.One of the more humorous effects you can achieve in Schedule 1 is the Shrinking effect.

While it may sound absurd, it can prove useful in certain situations where speed and agility are key. Here’s how to make it:This concoction is not only a fun twist on traditional drug effects but also offers players an interesting challenge in crafting such an unusual mix.If you're looking for a truly dangerous and high-risk recipe, the Explosive mix should be on your radar. This recipe causes the consumer to explode, which is not only one of the most dangerous effects in the game but also a dramatic example of how far you can push the limits of the game’s mechanics.

A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization. Dubbed the “ChatGPT Action Figure Trend,” this phenomenon is giving users the opportunity to create hyper-realistic images of themselves as collectible dolls or action figures—complete with toy box packaging, accessories, and thematic designs. The viral trend is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which now includes image generation capabilities through DALL·E, enabling users to craft customized toy-like avatars using a combination of uploaded photos and descriptive prompts.This trend follows a series of internet-wide moments in which AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, have enabled viral self-expression—such as Studio Ghibli-inspired portraits and AI-generated yearbook photos. The recent rise in ChatGPT traffic—reaching a record 184.4 million global visits on April 9, 2025, according to Similarweb—indicates not just interest in generative AI, but its growing cultural relevance in user-led digital art and identity play.Here’s everything to know about the ChatGPT action figure trend , how it works, what platforms are driving it, and why it's capturing the imagination of millions.The ChatGPT Action Figure Trend is a user-generated movement where individuals use AI to design digital images of themselves as action figures or Barbie-style dolls. The characters often appear inside a branded toy box, accompanied by miniature accessories, clothing, and backdrops that reflect the user’s personality, profession, or hobbies.While there is no confirmed origin for the trend, it rapidly gained traction on TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Reddit. The posts typically show the AI-generated doll and its box art, along with a caption describing the user's design choices. Some themes parody pop culture archetypes—like “Corporate Coffee Warrior” or “Freelance Chaos Coder”—while others take a more sincere, biographical approach.The trend taps into both nostalgia and novelty. For many, it recalls childhood memories of unboxing dolls or action figures, now merged with cutting-edge AI customization. The result is a quirky but powerful form of self-representation.To start, users need a ChatGPT account. The feature works best on the ChatGPT Plus plan, which includes GPT-4 and access to image generation tools like DALL·E 3. Free-tier users have limited access to image prompts and cannot upload personal images directly.Users can upload a selfie or a full-body photograph to help the AI better understand facial features, body proportions, and attire. The image is used by ChatGPT to render a more accurate digital likeness.Users then enter a detailed prompt instructing the AI to generate a toy box image of themselves. The prompt can include:Within seconds to a few minutes, ChatGPT generates an image that matches the description. The final result often looks like a professional marketing photo for a real-life toy.The success of the ChatGPT Action Figure Trend can be attributed to several factors:While fun and engaging, the trend has some caveats:Additionally, concerns have been raised about the long-term ethical implications of AI-generated identity manipulation and the use of personal data in training models—although OpenAI maintains that user-uploaded images are not used to train future models.","A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all- female space mission.

Final Thought: Musk's Mars Needs Mommies

If you thought Elon Musk was just the bloke sending Teslas into orbit and Doge memes into your timeline, think again. Behind the code, rockets, and Twitter tantrums lies a full-blown sci-fi fertility cult, with a plot that makes Handmaid’s Tale look like a parenting blog. From hush money to hush babies, Musk isn’t just building rockets—he’s building a legion. Literally. Here are ten jaw-dropping revelations from the Wall Street Journal’s expose that reads less like journalism and more like leaked notes from a Vatican fertility summit hosted by Trump.Elon Musk doesn’t have children. He has a legion. That’s what he calls his sprawling brood, borrowing the term from Roman military units known for conquest and expansion. The mission? To out-breed the collapse of Western civilisation. The method? Unclear. But one text from Musk to a baby mama suggests “we will need to use surrogates” to “reach legion-level before the apocalypse.” As you do.Every superhero needs a sidekick. Batman had Alfred. Elon has Jared Birchall, a devout Mormon who also plays financial consigliere, emotional midwife, and non-disclosure agreement enforcer. Birchall once warned a mother, “when a woman goes the legal route, that always, always leads to a worse outcome for that woman.” The man isn’t just protecting Musk—he’s doing fertility triage for MAGA Mars.Ashley St. Clair, a right-wing influencer, claimed Musk is the father of her baby—named Romulus, because Spartacus was taken. Musk offered her $15 million and $100K/month to keep mum. She wanted legitimacy. He wanted NDAs. When she declined the gag order, her support payments mysteriously began to...decline. Coincidence? Musk says, “Only the paranoid survive.” Also: “No comment.”Grimes, mother of three Musk-spawn, had to sue him for custody after he allegedly kept one child away from her for five months. The courtroom drama was brutal, with Musk’s team apparently dredging up her past to discredit her. Meanwhile, Musk offered his sperm to Shivon Zilis , his Neuralink executive, in what appears to be a corporate insemination strategy. And they say startups don’t have benefits.If Musk’s baby mothers were Hogwarts houses, Zilis would be Gryffindor. She has “special status,” attends black-tie dinners with Bezos and Ivanka, and meets Narendra Modi at Blair House with babies in tow. A Yale-educated AI expert and Musk’s Neuralink lieutenant, she may also be the real-life inspiration for whatever dystopian dating app Silicon Valley launches next.Somewhere in Austin lies Musk’s answer to population collapse: a gated compound where his children and their mothers can all reside. Yes, really. Zilis is already living there. Musk wanted St. Clair and Grimes to join the baby biodome too, presumably to coordinate diaper schedules and indoctrinate the legion. The others, it seems, weren’t so enthusiastic about the Mars Mommune.Musk’s method of meeting mothers is...very on-brand. He slides into the DMs of influencers on X, boosts their engagement, and sometimes asks them if they’d like to help him save humanity—by bearing his children. Tiffany Fong, a crypto influencer, was one such candidate. Her crime? Telling friends he asked. Result? Unfollowed, engagement tanked, earnings fell. Musk giveth, Musk taketh away.Musk once bragged about donating sperm to a high-profile Japanese woman after being approached by “Japanese officials.” No romance, he clarified. Just sperm. In another instance, he discouraged St. Clair from vaginal birth, citing concerns about brain size, and asked she not circumcise the baby—despite her being Jewish. Musk, it appears, doesn’t just believe in designing cars. He believes in designing babies.Musk’s romantic arc with St. Clair began on a private jet and climaxed with him wearing a custom black MAGA hat she made. During their relationship, he texted her policy ideas for Trump, asked her thoughts on Tulsi Gabbard as VP, and discussed how ""real men are made for war."" By the time Romulus was born, Musk was ghosting her texts and negotiating paternity tests through proxies.After St. Clair revealed the baby’s identity online to beat tabloid leaks, Musk cut her payment from $100K/month to $40K, then $20K. The timing coincided with her legal pushback. According to her lawyers, “money is being weaponized.” For a man who tweets about free speech and liberty, Musk seems very comfortable using his billions to enforce silence. Democracy may die in darkness, but paternity lives in litigation.Musk says he’s doing all this for the species. To save humanity. To ensure we’re “multiplanetary.” But one can’t help but notice that his ideal future involves rich, white, intelligent people—preferably conservative and under NDA—carrying out a eugenic mission under his oversight. It’s part Ayn Rand, part Handmaid’s Tale, part SpaceX baby bootcamp.He wants a Mars colony with crypto accounts, AI nannies, and fertility-by-algorithm. But Earth isn’t quite done watching the drama unfold. Whether Musk is remembered as the father of multiplanetary civilisation or just the world's richest sperm donor with a control complex remains to be seen.Either way, buckle up. The baby legion is just getting started.",The Wall Street Journal exposed Elon Musk's secret fertility cult. He offered Ashley St. Clair $15 million and $100K/month to keep mum.

What is a DDoS attack?

Video conferencing platform Zoom faced a major global outage on Friday, disrupting core services including video meetings, its website, and mobile applications. Zoom Communications later said it had resolved the issue, which left tens of thousands of users worldwide unable to connect.At the peak of the disruption around 3:01 p.m. ET, Downdetector.com — which tracks service outages — reported as many as 67,280 user complaints, primarily from the United States but also from several other countries. Users encountered error code 503 , commonly linked to server-side issues.“Service has now been restored after the earlier outage,” Zoom confirmed on X (formerly Twitter), after earlier acknowledging “domain name resolution issues on the zoom.us domain that is affecting multiple services.”The company is still investigating the cause of the outage and has not officially confirmed whether it was a cyberattack. However, several users on social media claimed that a hacking group named DarkStorm was behind a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack targeting Zoom.“We do work on USA platforms as we said,” the group posted on X, prompting further speculation. Zoom has yet to comment on the alleged attack.According to Zoom’s status page, the disruption impacted multiple services including Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Contact Center, and the company’s main website. Downdetector also recorded over 50,000 problem reports during the incident.A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a target server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. Unlike a traditional Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which typically comes from a single source, a DDoS attack originates from multiple sources, often using thousands of compromised devices such as computers, smartphones, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. These devices, collectively known as a ""botnet,"" are controlled remotely by cybercriminals without the knowledge of their owners.The goal of a DDoS attack is to exhaust the resources of the target system, making it unable to respond to legitimate requests. This can cause the targeted website, service, or network to slow down, become unavailable, or crash entirely. DDoS attacks can affect any online service, including websites, applications, and cloud-based platforms.DDoS attacks are difficult to defend against due to their distributed nature. The sheer volume of traffic can overwhelm even the most advanced security systems. Businesses and organizations often implement various strategies, such as traffic filtering and load balancing, to mitigate the impact of these attacks.","Zoom faced a major global outage on Friday, disrupting core services including video meetings, its website, and mobile applications.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Poll Do you support the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for European visitors to the UK? No Yes

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"
