"Who is Kashish Mittal? From IAS to Microsoft to AI to classical singing, the man going viral for his lyrics and LinkedIn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-kashish-mittal-from-ias-to-microsoft-to-ai-to-classical-singing-the-man-going-viral-for-his-lyrics-and-linkedin/articleshow/122899560.cms,"Kashish Mittal’s early achievements and civil services career

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability. His work blends technical innovation with philosophical depth, reflecting a rare balance of intellect and introspection.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana. He is an empanelled artist with ICCR and All India Radio, with his compositions reflecting a blend of spiritual depth and technical rigor. His renditions have gained widespread attention online, with many calling him a rare blend of intellect and art.In addition to his performances, Mittal’s presence on social media has contributed significantly to his viral fame in 2024 and 2025. His LinkedIn posts offer a unique blend of personal reflections, career insights, and poetic musings, resonating particularly well with a generation that values authenticity and non-traditional success stories. Screenshots of his profile and posts circulate widely, sparking conversations about breaking free from societal expectations and pursuing passion alongside professional achievement.Moreover, Mittal’s Instagram reels have garnered massive engagement. A particularly viral reel features him singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s “Unke Andaz-e-Karam,” amassing nearly 3 million views. The video captures his soulful voice and classical training in a spontaneous, relatable setting, often shared with captions reflecting the emotions of love and loss. This blend of classical artistry and modern social media appeal has cemented his status as a multi-hyphenate artist capturing the imagination of India’s youth and beyond. His journey is a reminder that it's never too late to rewrite your story and sing your own tune.","Kashish Mittal was an IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur, and now an Indian classical singer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery.

'As Gwyneth Paltrow said...': Astronomer CEO reveals a major update to move on from Kiss cam scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/as-gwyneth-paltrow-said-astronomer-ceo-reveals-a-major-update-to-move-on-from-kiss-cam-scandal/articleshow/122961055.cms,"Astronomer's Gwyneth Paltrow ad was done by actor Ryan Reynolds' production house Maximum Effort.





Astronomer CEO Pete DeJjoy in his latest message revealed that they not only roped in Gwyneth Paltrow but also actor Ryan Reynolds -- to tide over the Coldplay scandal in which the company's former CEO Andy Byron and former HR chief Kristin Cabot were involved. They were caught canoodling at a Coldplay concert in Boston, cheating on their respective partners. In the wake of a major social media backlash, both of them resigned and Astronomer is believed to have the last laugh in their masterclass PR.The company released a video featuring Gwyneth Paltrow who was formerly married to Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin but now it has been revealed that the tongue-in-cheek ad was created by Maximum Effort -- a production company of Ryan Reynolds.Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired by the company as a spokesperson on a ""very temporary basis"". In the video, she answers questions which are obvious but the answers are not. Like, OMG, what the actual f” and “How is your social media team holding…” but her answers are only focused on what Astronomer does and not anything about the controversy. “Thank you for your interest in Maximum Effort, @astronomerio!

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

With the new Umrah season starting in 2025, Saudi authorities are making clear that the focus is not just on numbers, but on the people behind them. The aim this year is simple: make the pilgrimage safer, easier, and more spiritually fulfilling. While millions are expected to visit the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, the Kingdom is working to remove the usual stress points, whether it’s confusion at busy mosques, difficulty for elderly visitors, or problems with hotel bookings.Instead of big slogans or ambitious promises, this year’s changes are grounded in real action. From helpful digital tools to safety gear for vulnerable groups, Saudi Arabia is pushing practical solutions. And with tighter inspections on tourist services, there's also a clear message: quality and safety matter more than ever.These new moves show how the Kingdom is managing modern challenges without losing sight of the spiritual heart of Umrah.One of the main upgrades this year is digital, and very hands-on. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has rolled out a campaign in Madinah to promote the ""Rushd"" app, designed specifically for pilgrims.What the app offers:The campaign is being run at key visitor areas around the Prophet’s Mosque, including historic locations. It’s not just about downloading an app, it’s about helping people use it in a meaningful way while they’re on their journey.To support vulnerable pilgrims, like children, the elderly, and visually impaired visitors, the General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque has launched smart safety bracelets.Here’s what they do:This isn’t about surveillance. It’s about safety, especially in a setting where it's easy to get separated or overwhelmed.A lot of what makes or breaks a pilgrim’s experience is behind the scenes: how smooth the transport is, how well the crowd is managed, or how clean and accessible public areas are. To that end, 16 new initiatives have been rolled out in Madinah under the Pilgrim Experience Program.What’s being improved:In total, 89 different projects across 23 government agencies are currently active, covering everything from security and tourism to health and logistics. According to officials, 95% of these projects are already completed or in final stages.Pilgrims shouldn’t have to worry about where they’re staying, especially in a city as sacred as Makkah. That’s why the Ministry of Tourism has stepped up inspections and closed 25 non-compliant facilities just this July.The reasons included:This crackdown is part of the wider ""Our Guests Come First"" campaign, which also encourages pilgrims to report issues through the Unified Tourism Center (dial 930).It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in a huge place like the Prophet’s Mosque, especially if you're a first-timer or don’t speak Arabic. That’s why two service centers within the mosque courtyards have played a key role in helping pilgrims feel supported.In 2024 alone, these centers:These centers focus on what matters most, comfort, clarity, and calm during worship.Rushd is a free mobile app launched by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. It includes tools like Quran access, prayer times, and a 3D guide for Umrah and Hajj. It's available on most app stores and promoted at major sites in Madinah.No. They are offered mainly to children, elderly pilgrims, and those with disabilities.

If your business in Dubai needs to operate outside regular hours, say, late at night or early morning, there’s something important you should know. Dubai law requires businesses to get a night work permit if they’re working between 9 PM and 6 AM.But not every business needs it. This permit is for specific types of work that take place after-hours inside commercial buildings, shopping malls, or banks. Think maintenance crews fixing lighting, staff doing inventory checks in retail stores, or film crews shooting scenes in a mall at night. It’s not for late-night shopping or customer-facing services.So why is this permit required? Mostly for safety, accountability, and legal compliance. After dark, closed spaces often have heightened security protocols. Workers moving around during these hours can trigger alarms or raise suspicion. This permit ensures everyone, employers, employees, property owners, and law enforcement, is on the same page. It’s also part of protecting the welfare of workers who are active during non-standard hours.This permit is meant for businesses or contractors doing non-commercial work after hours.

Missing documents can delay approval.The application isn’t expensive:You can pay via: Cash, Debit/credit cards or Apple PayYou have a few ways to submit your application:Applications are usually processed within one working day, though it may vary if extra approvals are needed.Once approved, your night work permit is valid for 14 days.

That includes protecting workers from burnout, setting boundaries on late-night shifts, and ensuring people aren’t forced to work in unsafe conditions.If you run a business that regularly needs to operate outside normal hours, staying on top of this permit process is a good way to avoid penalties, and show that you’re running your operations responsibly.","Dubai law requires businesses to get a night work permit if they’re working between 9 PM and 6 AM.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

""The H20 is a potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip. Designed specifically to work around export control thresholds, the H20 is optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models. For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.""

""Both U.S. and Chinese AI labs are betting that further investment in inference compute will be critical to the next leap in frontier AI capabilities. On the heels of DeepSeek’s breakthrough model release earlier this year, Chinese AI labs began bulk-ordering H20 chips to develop even more advanced AI models. If the U.S. backs off of export controls to China, we believe that China’s next generation of frontier AI will be built on the backs of the H20,"" the letter added.

""While the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s H20 chip are nominally civilian companies in China, we fully expect the H20 and the AI models it supports to be deployed by China’s People's Liberation Army.""

""The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one. We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security,"" concludes the letter.

Letter's signatories

Certain section of security experts seem quite upset with the Donald Trump administration's decision to allow sale of Nvidia H20 advanced AI chips to China again. A group of 20 national security experts and former government officials have written a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging the Trump administration to revert its decision to allow Nvidia to resume sale of Nvidia H20 AI chips in China .As reported by Tech Crunch, the letter calls the decision a 'Strategic Misstep'. It claims that the decision will have detrimental effects on the US' AI “edge” for both military and civilian use cases. The letter further claims that selling Nvidia H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the US and that these chips could be used to support China’s military.This letter comes weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China as the trade talks between the two countries started. At the time, Lutnick called Nvidia’s H20 as the company’s “fourth best” AI chip. The H20 chip reportedly sits at the center of a broader US-China trade talk standoff.

Vision-Only systems outperform LiDAR in recent tests

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded sarcastically to a viral video showing a Waymo autonomous vehicle attempting what appeared to be a head-on collision while blocking traffic in Austin, Texas. ""But what do I know about technology,"" Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter), reigniting the long-standing debate between LiDAR-based and vision-only autonomous driving systems.The incident, captured on July 6, 2025, showed the Waymo robotaxi making ""aggressive forward maneuvers"" while threatening an exiting vehicle. ""@Cyber_Trailer"" posted the footage, writing: ""Waymo chooses violence. Blocked traffic lane while attempting head on collision with exiting vehicle.

Ray, a Tesla enthusiast (@ray4tesla), used the moment to highlight broader concerns about sensor fusion approaches.""Elon famously said 6 years ago that LiDAR is a fool's errand and many at the time were skeptical about his claim,"" Ray posted. ""Now it's becoming increasingly clear that Elon is right about the use of LiDAR. Sensor fusion is not optimal for autonomous driving, as evidenced by countless incidents of Waymo blocking intersections, getting stuck in traffic for no reason, getting confused in construction zones and even worse going in the lane of opposing traffic.""The debate extends beyond individual incidents, with major autonomous vehicle companies reconsidering their sensor strategies.

""I'm really interested in this idea of digital patina. The things I love in my world are the things that are a little bit worn or rubbed down, and have scuff marks. Unfortunately, in the digital world, we don't have a sense of age,”

Microsoft has introduced an experimental feature for its CoPilot AI chatbot . Named Copilot Appearance, this update enables the AI assistant to recognise real-time facial expressions during voice conversations, including smiling, nodding, and raising eyebrows. This visual assistant is currently available in an early preview for users testing Copilot Labs . Microsoft's goal with this addition is to give Copilot a more human-like presence. The Copilot Appearance experiment aligns with Microsoft’s broader vision of evolving Copilot from a basic assistant into an AI companion. Microsoft’s AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman , has described this feature as giving Copilot its own ""digital patina"" that can develop over time with the user, aiming for more intuitive and human-like AI interactions.Users interested in trying Copilot Appearance can enable it through the voice settings in the Copilot interface. The feature is currently being tested with a limited group of users in the US, UK, and Canada. If you're not part of this test group, the option may not appear in your settings.At this stage, Copilot Appearance can display expressions such as smiling, nodding, and raising an eyebrow, all while maintaining the same familiar voice. The experiment is currently limited to the web version, and Microsoft hasn't announced any plans to expand it to Windows or mobile platforms.The feature includes real-time expressions such as smiles, nods, and surprised looks, all synced with Copilot’s speech engine to reflect tone and pace. It also remembers earlier parts of your conversation, allowing it to reference previous topics for a more natural flow of conversation.In a recent episode of The Colin & Samir Show, Suleyman discussed how Copilot will eventually have its own ""room"" to exist in and may develop a kind of ""digital patina"" over time.he noted.","Microsoft has introduced an experimental feature for its CoPilot AI chatbot.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Microsoft's Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.

Ramine Tinati , lead at Accenture , APAC Center for Advanced AI recently said that artificial intelligence (AI) tools may help people finish tasks faster, but they don’t automatically make workers more productive unless companies rethink how work is done. Speaking at Fortune’s Brainstorm AI Singapore conference recently, Tinati said “If you give employees a tool to do things faster, they do it faster. But are they more productive? Probably not, because they do it faster and then go for coffee breaks”.According to the Accenture executive, speeding up existing tasks isn’t enough. Real productivity improvements, he said, require companies to redesign their workflows completely. During the conversation, he also noted that some Asian companies are falling behind in AI use “because they don’t think about reinventing the work.”His comments come at a time when major companies are investing heavily in generative AI. Amazon has committed over $100 billion to AI investments, while Microsoft has invested $80 billion into AI data centers—even as it cut multiple jobs this year.However, not all experts see AI as a threat. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed a MIT research suggesting artificial intelligence diminishes cognitive abilities, arguing instead that his daily AI use has actually enhanced his thinking skills. Speaking on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that aired on July 13, Huang said he uses AI ""literally every single day"" and believes his ""cognitive skills are actually advancing.""OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared an X (formerly Twitter) post stating that he agrees with lots of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said about AI and jobs. He believes that jobs will be very different from what they are now, but will still be meaningful. “Agree with lots of what Jensen has been saying about ai and jobs; there is a ton of stuff to do in the world,” Altman wrote in the post.He continued “for sure jobs will be very different, and maybe the jobs of the future will look like playing games to us today while still being very meaningful to those people of the future.

Bill Gates quietly paid a daily fine of $28 for 13 years; the Porsche connection may surprise you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-quietly-paid-a-daily-fine-of-28-for-13-years-the-porsche-connection-may-surprise-you/articleshow/122952312.cms,"Bill Gates quietly paid a daily fine of $28 for 13 years; the Porsche connection may surprise you

Bill Gates’ Porsche was banned in the US: Here’s how he fought back



The “Show or Display” rule: A loophole born from one supercar



Counting the cost of a 13-year standoff

Legacy beyond one collector’s garage



In 1988, Bill Gates placed an order for the Porsche 959 Komfort, the most advanced road car of its era and one of only 337 ever built. The twin-turbo, all-wheel-drive coupe could top 200 mph and featured technology that later became standard on everyday cars. Gates paid roughly $400,000—then something close to pocket change for a rising software mogul—but he overlooked one problem: the United States had never certified the 959 for safety or emissions. When the car reached the Port of Seattle, it was declared illegal to register or drive, yet officials offered a compromise. They would hold the Porsche in a bonded warehouse if the owner paid a storage and customs bond of $28 every day. Gates agreed, believing regulators would soon modernise the 1960s-era import code. They did not. For the next thirteen years, the 959 sat wrapped in plastic while Microsoft’s co-founder quietly signed cheques that eventually surpassed $132,000. No reporters noticed, no press release boasted about the world’s most expensive parking fee—just a man, a dream car, and a slow-moving bureaucracy.US law allowed owners to retrofit foreign cars to local standards, but the 959 presented two hurdles. First, Porsche never built a 959 test vehicle for destructive crash certification, so importers could not prove compliance without destroying another limited-edition example. Second, its complex electronics made emissions re-tuning expensive and uncertain. Any attempt to certify the car risked erasing the very technology that made it special. Gates, joined by fellow 959 buyer and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, began lobbying Congress for an alternative path that would respect technological landmarks without compromising public safety.Years of behind-the-scenes persuasion culminated in 1999 when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration introduced the Show or Display exemption. The rule lets owners import vehicles deemed historically or technologically significant, provided annual mileage stays below 2,500 miles and the cars remain in near-original condition. The Porsche 959 became the poster child of the new list. Two years later, Gates finally took delivery, drove the car legally on US roads, and ended his daily fine. Critics called the exemption preferential treatment for billionaires, yet preservationists note the same rule now protects everything from early fuel-cell prototypes to the McLaren F1.Gates’ ledger shows about 4,745 days of storage fees at $28 each, plus periodic bond renewals of $500. Adjusted for inflation, the sum approaches $300,000 in today’s dollars—comparable to the original purchase price. Still, Gates appears to have no regrets. In a 2018 television interview, he called the 959 “the car that proved software belongs in automobiles,” a nod to its adaptive suspension and in-dash diagnostics. The saga also underscored how innovation often races ahead of regulation; only when a high-profile case exposes the gap does the rulebook catch up.The Porsche 959 episode shifted US automotive policy, opened museum doors to foreign prototypes, and previewed debates now playing out around autonomous-vehicle imports. It also showed how personal passion can drive policy change: a billionaire wanted to enjoy a piece of engineering history, and the solution he championed now benefits restorers, educators, and small collectors nationwide. The 959 itself remains in Gates’ private fleet, reportedly driven sparingly on summer roads around Washington State—a rolling reminder that sometimes law bends, eventually, to the lure of innovation.","Bill Gates paid $400,000 for the Porsche 959 Komfort, the most advanced road car of its era and one of only 337 ever built.

Shiny Odds of Toedscruel in Pokemon GO and Future Planning

has officially made itsdebut during Adventure Week 2025 (July 29 to August 3), adding a fresh face to the wild spawns. While its shiny version isn’t available just yet, trainers have a limited-time opportunity to load up on candy and prepare for future releases.Here’s everything you need to know about catching Toedscool in Pokemon GO, evolving it into Toedscruel, and why shiny hunters should care.You can find Toedscool in Pokemon GO in the wild only during Adventure Week 2025 and appears exclusively in Forest and Grassland biomes. This is its first appearance in the game, making it a must-catch for collectors and Pokédex completionists.To evolve Toedscool into Toedscruel, you’ll need 50 Toedscool Candy. Important note: this evolution line is separate from Tentacool and Tentacruel, so their candies are not interchangeable.Toedscruel cannot be caught in the wild and must be obtained through evolution.As of Adventure Week 2025, shiny Toedscool and shiny Toedscruel are not available in Pokemon GO. While Toedscool makes its in-game debut, the shiny spotlight is on Wiglett for this event. There’s no confirmation on when the shiny versions of Toedscool and Toedscruel will drop, but based on past trends, Niantic often saves shiny releases for future events.Even without a shiny release, Toedscool is worth farming during Adventure Week. Here’s why:• Niantic frequently releases shinies in future versions of the same event, like the next Adventure Week or through special research.• Catching Toedscool in bulk now ensures you have plenty of candy to instantly evolve a shiny one when it finally becomes available.• Its limited-time availability means waiting until next year might be your only option if you miss this window.• Go Biome Hunting: Stick to Forest and Grassland biomes. Parks, wooded trails, and green rural areas are your best bet.• Use Incense: Incense lasts two hours during the event and can drastically increase your chances, especially while walking.• Complete Event Research: Adventure Week includes Field and Timed Research tasks that may offer bonus encounters or useful rewards.• Plan for Future Trades: Stocking up on extra Toedscool now means you’ll have trade fodder if shiny forms drop later.In the mainline games:• Shiny Toedscool features a grayish tone in place of its usual beige, with soft silvery accents.• Shiny Toedscruel swaps its golden hues for ghostly grays and whites, giving it a more mysterious, elegant appearance.If these designs make it to Pokemon GO, they’ll stand out dramatically in any collection.Although shiny Toedscool isn’t active yet, standard wild shiny odds in Pokemon GO hover around 1 in 400 to 1 in 500. However, when new shinies debut through events, odds are often temporarily boosted.Shiny hunters recommend:• Playing in high-density spawn areas.• Using cluster spawns in biome-rich zones.• Prioritizing quantity during limited-time windows.While shiny Toedscool and Toedscruel aren’t available yet, the current Adventure Week offers an ideal opportunity to prep for their inevitable release. Catch as many as possible, stock up on candy, and be ready to evolve the moment their shiny versions go live.Also read: How to Catch Shiny Wiglett and Shiny Wugtrio in Pokemon GO In the world of shiny hunting, being one step ahead is everything.

Tips for Shiny Hunting Wiglett & Wugtrio

The Garden Eel Pokemon - Wiglett and Wugtrio - have officially surfaced in Pokemon GO, straight from the Paldea region of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Their debut during Adventure Week 2025 also marks the arrival of their shiny forms, making this a must-play event for shiny hunters.Here’s everything you need to know to catch Shiny Wiglett and Shiny Wugtrio in Pokemon GO, from spawn locations to evolution and shiny-hunting strategies.Wiglett is exclusive to beach biomes, meaning it spawns near real-world water bodies like oceans, rivers, and lakes.• Head to coastal areas, lakesides, or rivers - these are Wiglett’s preferred habitats.• Use Incense or Lure Modules to attract more spawns. During Adventure Week, Incense lasts for 2 hours, increasing efficiency.• Watch for Wiglett’s silhouette on your Nearby radar, especially near PokéStops in water-rich areas.• Be prepared - Wiglett is a rare encounter even within its biome, so patience is key.The Adventure Week 2025 event runs from July 29 to August 3, and it’s the first time Shiny Wiglett is available in the game.• Wiglett spawns more frequently in beach biomes during this event.• Although the shiny odds aren’t boosted, fewer competing spawns in beach biomes mean better chances.• Expect to see other water-type Pokemon like Inkay, Mareanie, Dewpider, and Sandygast - adding variety but requiring extra attention.Follow these steps to increase your odds of getting Shiny Wiglett in Pokemon GO:• Visit beach biomes during Adventure Week or future events where shiny Wiglett is featured.• Use Incense and Lure Modules for better spawn rates.• Stay persistent - Wiglett is a low-spawn-rate Pokemon.• Use Pinap Berries to double Candy per catch.• Keep your inventory stocked with Poké Balls and Berries - Wiglett can be tricky to catch.To evolve Wiglett into Wugtrio, you’ll need 50 Wiglett Candy.Ways to Earn Candy:Once you’ve collected 50 Candy, tap the Evolve button in Wiglett’s profile.Evolving a shiny Wiglett will give you a Shiny Wugtrio, which sports a bright blue body and golden nose - a stark contrast to the standard Wugtrio.Collecting both shiny forms adds value to your shiny Dex and makes for an impressive addition to your water-type collection.To make the most of the event:• Plan trips to beach biomes during the event window.• Activate your Daily Adventure Incense when near water bodies.• Bring extra Pinap Berries for faster Candy collection.• Use the Nearby Radar strategically - scan for beach-specific spawns.• Travel smart - use public beach areas or river trails with dense PokéStops.Wiglett and Wugtrio’s shiny forms are among the most visually distinct additions to Pokemon GO. Their biome-locked nature adds a layer of adventure and challenge, perfectly aligning with the spirit of Adventure Week 2025. Whether you’re trekking to the coast or strolling around a local lake, this is a great time to step outside and hunt.Get your gear ready, stock up on Incense and Berries, and head to the water - Shiny Wiglett and Wugtrio await.","The Garden Eel Pokemon - Wiglett and Wugtrio - have officially surfaced in Pokemon GO, straight from the Paldea region of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet.
