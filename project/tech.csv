What does Josh Allen drive?

Inside Josh Allen’s SUPER SIZED Car Collection

Also Read:

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player, but his success off the field is just as visible - especially when it comes to what’s parked in his garage. From rugged trucks built for harsh Buffalo winters to high-end luxury and speed machines, Allen’s car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to NFL superstardom.Allen’s rise in the NFL has been matched by a major financial leap. After signing a six-year, $258 million contract extension with the Bills in 2021, the quarterback gained the freedom to indulge in his love for powerful vehicles. Yet, his choices suggest balance rather than excess. Many of Allen’s cars are built for utility and durability, fitting for a quarterback who plays in one of the league’s coldest markets.One of the cars of his garage is the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, a full-size SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. With all-wheel drive and a spacious, luxury-filled interior, it’s a practical choice for Buffalo winters while still offering premium comfort.Allen has never hidden his appreciation for trucks, a nod to his upbringing in Firebaugh, California. His Ford F-150 Raptor, customized in an all-black finish, stands out as one of the most rugged vehicles he owns. Equipped with a powerful V8 engine and impressive ground clearance, the Raptor is built for tough terrain and poor weather, ideal for Western New York conditions.Adding to the SUV-heavy lineup is the Range Rover Sport, which blends performance, off-road ability, and luxury. With a refined interior and strong engine options, the Range Rover offers Allen a smoother, more polished driving experience without sacrificing strength.Allen’s garage also features vehicles that lean more toward style and speed. The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, known for its boxy design and elite status, brings both luxury and brute force. Its V8 engine and plush interior make it a favorite among elite athletes, and Allen is no exception.Allen also owns a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. With nearly 800 horsepower under the hood, the Hellcat is the most aggressive car in his collection, designed for straight-line speed and raw performance.Rounding out the collection is Allen’s most exotic ride, the Aston Martin Vantage. Sleek, fast, and unmistakably premium, the Vantage represents Allen’s taste for high-end performance cars. With a 0-60 mph time in just three seconds, it stands apart from his trucks and SUVs, highlighting a taste for refined speed.Josh Allen’s car collection isn’t about flash alone. It mirrors his journey grounded, powerful, and versatile.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player.

American billionaire Mark Cuban to young engineers: Pick small or medium companies over MNCs as bringing new graduates on AI projects is …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-billionaire-mark-cuban-to-young-engineers-pick-small-or-medium-companies-over-mncs-as-bringing-new-graduates-on-ai-projects-is-/articleshow/125977182.cms,"Mark Cuban advice young engineers to not go behind big companies

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark Cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Travel warnings

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money. On seeing this, the Speaker quipped, “There are 10 notes, yet 12 owners.” Proceedings were briefly halted amid the laughter and confusion.A video of the episode went viral on social media, with many Pakistanis mocking their lawmakers. According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

Where HAMMER fits in India’s precision strike ecosystem









India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. More than a new addition to the arsenal, HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare.Developed by France’s Safran Electronics & Defense, HAMMER is a modular precision strike system designed to hit targets from stand-off ranges while keeping aircraft outside heavily defended airspace. Its architecture combines guidance kits, propulsion and standard bomb bodies, allowing rapid adaptation across missions and platforms. The system is already combat-proven and integrated with aircraft such as the Rafale.Under a new agreement, Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, creating a common precision strike capability across both imported and home-grown fleets.At a time when air power is defined less by numbers and more by accuracy, stand-off reach and controlled escalation, the localisation of HAMMER signals a strategic shift from buying weapons to mastering precision strike technology itself.The Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER precision-guided weapons during Operation Sindoor on 7 May 2025 as part of a carefully calibrated cross-border strike against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22. A total of nine sites were struck, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s primary base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Weapon selection was central to the operation’s objectives. The Indian Air Force employed a layered mix of SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER precision-guided bombs and loitering munitions.Within this mix, HAMMER was used where flexibility and adaptability were essential. Its modular design and multiple guidance options allowed the IAF to tailor strikes based on the nature of individual targets and real-time assessments.HAMMER enabled stand-off engagement without requiring aircraft to fly directly over heavily defended areas. Its off-axis launch capability reduced exposure to Pakistan’s air defence network, particularly in areas close to population centres and sensitive military zones.The weapon’s precision supported the operation’s political and military messaging by reducing the risk of collateral damage. By pairing HAMMER with SCALP, the Indian Air Force demonstrated a layered strike doctrine, with SCALP neutralising deep, hardened targets and HAMMER engaging medium-range sites requiring precision and manoeuvrability.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, officially designated as AASM from the French Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.Despite often being described as a missile, HAMMER is fundamentally a guided bomb system. At its core is a standard unguided bomb, which becomes a high-precision strike weapon once fitted with modular guidance and propulsion kits. This design allows air forces to convert existing bomb inventories into modern precision weapons without developing entirely new missiles for each mission profile.The system is built around two main components. The first is a nose-mounted guidance section that determines how the weapon navigates and locks onto its target. Depending on the mission, this guidance kit can combine inertial navigation and GPS for all-weather strikes, infrared imaging for high-precision attacks on fixed targets, or laser guidance for engaging moving targets.The second component is a tail-mounted range extension kit, which includes a solid-fuel rocket booster and manoeuvrable winglets. Once released, the booster ignites to increase stand-off range, while the winglets allow the weapon to alter its flight path, perform sharp turns and attack targets from off-axis angles. In combat, this enables launch aircraft to remain outside heavily defended airspace while still striking accurately.HAMMER kits can be attached to bombs weighing 125 kilograms, 250 kilograms, 500 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, including widely used Mark 80 series bombs. This scalability allows the same weapon system to be used against a range of targets, from lightly protected structures to hardened bunkers.In operational use, HAMMER has demonstrated the ability to strike targets from significant distances, engage multiple targets in a single sortie and maintain accuracy in contested environments. Its combination of modularity, manoeuvrability and precision makes it particularly suited to modern air operations where speed, flexibility and controlled escalation are critical.In modern air warfare, weapons fall broadly into three categories: unguided bombs, guided bombs and air-to-surface missiles.Unguided bombs are cheap but inaccurate and require aircraft to fly directly over targets. Air-to-surface missiles offer long range and precision but are expensive and limited in numbers.HAMMER sits between these two extremes. It offers missile-like precision and stand-off range while retaining the flexibility and lower cost structure of a guided bomb.This distinction matters. Guided bombs like HAMMER allow air forces to carry larger numbers of precision weapons, adapt them to multiple target types and deploy them from a wide range of aircraft.The defining feature of HAMMER is modularity. Instead of designing a single fixed weapon, Safran developed a system where guidance, propulsion and bomb body can be mixed and matched.The nose-mounted guidance kit determines how the weapon finds and tracks its target. The rear-mounted range extension kit determines how far it can travel after release and how sharply it can manoeuvre.This modular architecture allows the same basic weapon to be used for close air support, deep strike, bunker busting and attacks on moving targets, depending on the guidance kit selected.For India, this means fewer weapon types to manage logistically while retaining operational flexibility.HAMMER is available in three primary guidance configurations.The baseline version combines an inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning System receiver. Data from both systems is fused using Kalman filtering, allowing the weapon to maintain accuracy even if GPS signals are degraded or jammed. This variant achieves a circular error probability of around 10 metres and works in all weather conditions.The second variant adds infrared homing to the INS and GPS combination. This system matches the target area with a reference image stored in the weapon’s memory, allowing accuracy of around one metre. It works day and night in fair weather and is particularly useful against fixed targets with a clear thermal signature.The third variant replaces infrared homing with laser guidance. This allows HAMMER to strike moving targets, provided they are illuminated by a laser designator from an aircraft, drone or ground team. This version was qualified in April 2013.These variants were redesignated in 2010 as SBU-38, SBU-64 and SBU-54 respectively, with the overall system renamed HAMMER for export.HAMMER’s range depends on launch altitude and configuration. Safran cites a range of over 32 nautical miles from high altitude and around 8 nautical miles from low-level release.The winglets and rocket booster allow off-axis launches of up to 90 degrees, meaning the aircraft does not have to point directly at the target. This reduces exposure to enemy air defences.Multiple HAMMER weapons can be released in a single pass against different targets with one trigger press, a capability that significantly enhances strike efficiency.HAMMER entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation on the Rafale platform.Its combat debut came in Afghanistan in April 2008, when a Rafale dropped two HAMMER weapons in support of ground troops.The system gained wider attention during the 2011 Libya campaign. A HAMMER weapon destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2 Galeb aircraft on the runway at Misrata Airport shortly after it landed. Another strike destroyed a Libyan tank at a distance of 55 kilometres. In total, 225 HAMMER weapons were used in Libya.This combat history is critical. Weapons that have been tested in real conflicts carry credibility in terms of reliability, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.India ordered large numbers of HAMMER weapons in September 2020. Deliveries were completed by November 2020, with the French Air and Space Force transferring part of its own stock to ensure immediate availability.The Indian Air Force initially integrated HAMMER on the Rafale fleet. Work has since begun to integrate it onto the Tejas, a process that involves complex software, avionics and flight control modifications.Successful integration on Tejas would represent a major step in combining imported high-end weapons with indigenous platforms.According to France’s Senate committee on defence manufacturing costs, the total cost of the AASM programme including development and delivery of 2,348 kits was €846 million, placing the per-weapon cost at around $300,000.Earlier figures showed a unit cost of €164,000 excluding development and €252,000 including development. By 2017, Safran reported a unit cost of €120,000 for the AASM Evolution version, with a target of reducing it to €80,000 through larger production runs.For India, domestic production offers the potential to lower costs over time while ensuring availability during crises.India today operates a layered precision strike inventory.Indigenous systems include the Sudarshan Laser Guided Bomb, the Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon, and glide bombs such as Gaurav and Garuthmaa.Imported and jointly developed systems include the SPICE series from Israel, HAMMER from France and the BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missile.HAMMER fills a crucial middle ground between short-range guided bombs and long-range cruise missiles, offering flexibility, precision and affordability.Manufacturing HAMMER in India is not just about supply security. It allows Indian engineers and technicians to gain deep familiarity with guidance systems, propulsion integration and precision strike workflows.This knowledge is transferable to future indigenous weapons programmes and reduces long-term dependence on foreign suppliers for upgrades and maintenance.The deal also strengthens India’s defence partnership with France at a time when New Delhi is diversifying beyond traditional suppliers.The BEL–Safran HAMMER joint venture represents a quiet but important shift in India’s approach to air warfare. Precision, modularity and adaptability are now central to how air power is conceived and deployed.By moving HAMMER production to Indian soil, New Delhi is not merely acquiring a weapon. It is acquiring the ability to understand, modify and eventually design the tools of modern precision strike warfare.","India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

Saudi Arabia ’s new electric transit system

Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in 2026

Smart, cool, and comfortable



Smart Ticketing: No more fumbling for cash. Use your smartphone or on-site vending machines to secure your ride instantly.

Climate-Controlled Sanctuary: Each bus is a high-tech refuge from the heat, equipped with high-efficiency air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and USB charging ports at every seat.

Accessibility for All: A specialized hydraulic system allows the buses to ""kneel"" for level boarding, making the service fully accessible for elderly pilgrims, wheelchair users, and families with strollers.

Real-Time Data: Digital displays at every stop and inside the buses provide live updates on arrival times and destination info in multiple languages.





If you are planning your journey to the Holy City in 2026, your experience on the ground is about to feel significantly smoother, quieter, and more sophisticated. Following its official inauguration in late 2025, the Masar BRT was officially launched as the first fully electric bus rapid transit network in the Middle East.This project isn't just a fleet of new vehicles; it is a total transformation of how millions move through the heart of Makkah, blending deep spiritual tradition with cutting-edge 21st-century sustainability.Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport as the Kingdom prepares for rising Hajj and Umrah numbers in 2026 and beyond. The new system is designed to make movement around the holy city faster, cleaner, and more reliable, especially during peak pilgrimage seasons when crowd pressure is at its highest.The electric bus network has been introduced along the Masar corridor, a key urban route that connects major transport hubs with areas close to the Grand Mosque. Officials say the project reflects Saudi Arabia’s wider push to modernise pilgrimage services while reducing congestion, emissions, and travel stress for millions of visitors.At the heart of the project is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system powered entirely by electricity, replacing conventional diesel buses on one of Mecca’s most heavily used corridors.The route stretches for around four kilometres, linking the Haramain High-Speed Railway station with central Mecca, bringing pilgrims closer to Masjid Al Haram through a dedicated, high-capacity transport line.The network includes multiple modern stations and stops, allowing pilgrims to board and exit easily without long walks or repeated vehicle changes. Dedicated lanes help buses avoid traffic bottlenecks, a major challenge during Hajj and Umrah seasons, ensuring more predictable travel times for worshippers.For pilgrims planning to visit Mecca in 2026, the new electric bus network promises a noticeably improved experience. Large numbers of Hajj and Umrah visitors traditionally rely on buses to move between hotels, prayer areas, and transport hubs, often facing delays during peak hours.The electric buses are designed to carry high passenger volumes, operate quietly, and offer smoother rides, a significant benefit for elderly pilgrims and families. Authorities expect the system to reduce road congestion, shorten journey times, and make daily movement within Mecca more manageable during the busiest pilgrimage periods.Officials have also highlighted the system’s role in crowd management, helping distribute pilgrim flow more evenly and easing pressure on surrounding road networks.The days of navigating crowded, aging buses are over. The new network, managed by Electromin, utilizes an ""Intelligent Transport System"" (ITS) that provides a passenger experience more akin to a modern metro than a traditional bus:This shift to electric power is a cornerstone of the Saudi Vision 2030 goals to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors. By replacing traditional diesel engines with 420kWh high-capacity batteries, the project will prevent over 31.5 million kilograms of CO2 emissions over its lifespan.The electric bus launch is not a standalone project but part of a broader transformation of Mecca’s transport ecosystem. It complements the Haramain High-Speed Railway, pedestrian improvements, and future public transport expansions aimed at serving millions of annual visitors more efficiently.","Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport.

Advice for daily commuters





As unstable weather conditions continue to sweep across the UAE, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has taken decisive action to ensure public safety.In a recent announcement, the authority confirmed the temporary suspension of several vital intercity bus routes connecting Dubai to the neighboring emirates of Sharjah and Ajman.With heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and reduced visibility affecting the nation’s highways, here is a comprehensive look at the changes and what you need to know for your daily commute.The suspension primarily targets the busy corridors between Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.While internal Dubai buses are still running, albeit with some delays, the following intercity lines are currently on standby:The RTA emphasized that these measures are proactive, designed to prevent commuters from being caught in traffic gridlock or dangerous road conditions as water levels rise in certain areas.The decision comes as the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued alerts for thunderstorms, lightning, and even hail in parts of the country.For the RTA, the logic is simple: ""Your safety is our priority.""Heavy rain often leads to water accumulation on major arterial roads, such as Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road and Emirates Road. By suspending these services, the RTA reduces the number of large vehicles on the road, allowing emergency teams better access to manage drainage and clear obstructions.Dubai Police have also echoed this sentiment, urging motorists to avoid unnecessary travel and stay indoors until the peak of the storm passes.Service will only resume once the RTA and police authorities deem the roads completely safe for heavy vehicle transit.

How to get started

Vision for financial inclusion





Dubai has welcomed a new way for people to apply for home loans with the official launch of Yubi Mortgage, a technology-powered mortgage platform. It’s the first consumer-focused offering from Yubi in the UAE and marks a major milestone in how mortgages are accessed and processed in the region.In a major move for the UAE property market, Yubi Group has launched Yubi Mortgage, a first-of-its-kind digital mortgage platform designed to simplify and speed up home financing for buyers. This marks Yubi’s first consumer-facing (B2C) offering in the region, positioning it as a disruptive force in home lending.Traditionally, getting a mortgage in the UAE has involved complex paperwork, limited visibility into application status, and uncertainty over lender options. Yubi’s digital platform aims to change this by bringing everything onto one easy-to-use online portal that connects borrowers with lenders and uses modern technology to streamline the entire journey.Yubi Mortgage was built to tackle the biggest pain points for homebuyers:For homebuyers, this means fewer forms, less delay, and clearer visibility into the process, a big shift from the traditional way mortgages are handled in the UAE.Transparency is the name of the game. Yubi MENA has already secured partnerships with over 25 major lenders. This network isn't limited to just traditional retail banks; it includes:Because Yubi uses a ""business rule engine,"" the platform acts like a matchmaker. It scans the current market to find the lender that fits your specific financial profile. While you get a simple interface, lenders get a more disciplined workflow, meaning they only see applications that actually fit their criteria, which leads to much faster approval times for you.If you’re ready to stop dreaming and start buying, the process is live. You can visit the official portal at mortgage.go-yubi.ae , enter your contact details, and a personalized support team from Yubi will guide you through the digital journey.Whether you are a first-time buyer in Dubai or an international investor looking at Abu Dhabi, the gate to UAE real estate just swung wide open.This launch is a major milestone in Yubi's global expansion. Backed by heavyweights like Peak XV, Lightspeed, and Insight Partners, Yubi has already facilitated over $36 billion in debt globally. Now, they are bringing that same ""Indian success story"" to the Middle East.Sivakumar Rajakkannu, Chief Business Officer at Yubi MENA, noted during the launch that homeownership is one of life’s biggest decisions. He emphasized that the goal is to make the journey ""simple and transparent,"" ensuring every seeker feels supported from that first click to the final handshake. By digitizing the end-to-end debt lifecycle, Yubi is helping the UAE reach its broader goals of digital transformation and financial inclusion.","Yubi Mortgage is a digital mortgage platform designed to simplify and speed up home financing for buyers.

Saudi Arabia Earthquake 2025

The epicenter



Impact

No injuries or casualties have been reported.

No structural damage to buildings or infrastructure was observed.

Neighboring countries, including the UAE, were completely unaffected. The NCM specifically noted that the tremor was not felt by residents in the Emirates and posed no threat to the country’s coastal areas.

The bigger picture

The fourth notable tremor

April 2025: A 4.0 magnitude quake struck 55 km east of Jubail.

July 2025: A stronger 5.1 magnitude tremor was recorded near the Farasan Islands in the south.

October 2025: A 4.34 magnitude quake hit the Arabian Gulf, northeast of Khafji.

December 2025: The current 4.3 magnitude event in the Eastern Province.





Residents of Saudi Arabia ’s Eastern Province experienced an unexpected start to their Wednesday morning as a moderate earthquake rippled through the region, briefly unsettling communities while remaining under close monitoring by authorities. The tremor was felt across several areas, prompting residents to share their experiences online, while official monitoring agencies confirmed that no immediate damage or injuries were reported.In the early hours of Wednesday, December 17, 2025, a 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The tremor was recorded at 2:11 am (UAE time) at a depth of about 50 kilometers beneath the surface, according to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) of the UAE and seismic data from Saudi authorities.Seismologists describe this level of earthquake as moderate, strong enough to be measured clearly by instruments but unlikely to cause significant damage at the surface.The quake’s epicenter was in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, a region that sits near the Arabian Gulf. While Saudi Arabia isn’t commonly thought of as a hotbed of seismic activity, the Arabian Plate and adjacent fault systems are geologically active, making smaller tremors a routine scientific observation.Past quakes of similar strengths, including earlier 4.3-magnitude events detected offshore near Jubail, have been tracked by monitoring networks without causing harm.Experts explain that these events often reflect the slow movement of tectonic plates, such as the Arabian Plate pushing against neighboring plates like the Eurasian Plate. This stress occasionally releases as minor tremors across the wider Gulf region.Despite the 4.3 magnitude, which is classified as a ""light"" to ""moderate"" earthquake, authorities have been quick to reassure the public. The Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) and regional weather centers confirmed that:While Saudi Arabia isn’t typically known for frequent major earthquakes, the region does experience occasional seismic activity, particularly along its fault lines in the Red Sea and near the Arabian Gulf.Experts from the Saudi Geological Survey emphasize that the National Seismic Monitoring Network is constantly active, tracking every minor shift in the earth's crust. This network provides real-time data to ensure that any potential threats are identified and communicated to the public instantly.Understanding the science behind small tremors helps communities stay informed without unnecessary alarm.This midnight event marks the fourth notable seismic occurrence within the Kingdom or its immediate coastal waters this year. This series of minor quakes highlights the ongoing tectonic adjustments in the region:Geologists explain that these frequent but minor events are often caused by the Arabian Tectonic Plate slowly colliding with the Eurasian Plate. Rather than a cause for alarm, experts see these as natural ""pressure releases"" that prevent the buildup of much larger, more destructive energy.For those living in the Eastern Province, this event serves as a gentle reminder of nature’s power. Geologists suggest that small tremors like these are often just the earth releasing built-up pressure in a safe, non-destructive way. As of now, the situation is entirely stable, and daily life continues as normal across the Kingdom.","A 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.

UAE launches its first Licensed Sports Wagering and iGaming Website,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-launches-its-first-licensed-sports-wagering-and-igaming-website/articleshow/125972366.cms,"UAE enters regulated online sports betting market officially / AI Generated Image

for its upcoming integrated resort on Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah. Vendor licences to international gaming suppliers, allowing them to offer equipment, software and technology to licensed operators in the UAE market.

Supplier licences like the one obtained by Sportradar, a major sports data and betting services provider, further strengthening the ecosystem for regulated online sports wagering and gaming.

How to download Play971?





The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting with the launch of its first licensed internet gaming and sports wagering website. The platform, called Play971, is officially authorised and regulated by the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), the federal body responsible for supervising all commercial gaming activity in the country.Play971 is operated by Coin Technology Projects LLC, a firm incorporated in Abu Dhabi with its main base at Twofour54 Yas Creative Hub, and claims to be fully “located, licensed and regulated in the UAE.” This launch marks a significant milestone for a country that has long been known for strict anti-gambling laws rooted in cultural and religious norms.Play971’s debut represents more than just a new website. It introduces a regulated environment for real-money online games and sports wagering that did not exist before under UAE law. The platform includes a range of casino-style games and sports betting markets, including popular events like football and tennis.Under the supervision of the GCGRA, players and operators must follow strict responsible gaming standards, including systems to verify user identity and ensure that only eligible participants within the UAE can access the service. This controlled launch currently applies in certain emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah, with broader availability expected in early 2026 as the regulatory framework and licensing system evolves.This early rollout serves as a test case for future operators, and regulators continue to refine licensing categories, supplier approvals and compliance rules so that the market expands safely and transparently.The UAE’s move toward regulated online gaming builds on multiple earlier steps. In 2024, the first official lottery licence was awarded to The Game LLC, beginning regulated draw operations with major prizes.According to the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), internet gaming is considered a form of “commercial gaming conducted via the internet, using computers, mobile phones, or other digital devices with access to websites or apps that offer games and bets involving chance, skill, or a combination of both.” The regulator notes that these games include bingo, casino games such as slots and poker, eSports, fantasy games, peer-to-peer games, skill-based games, sports betting, and more.On sports wagering specifically, the GCGRA explains that it “involves betting on the outcome of sports events or the performance of athletes or teams,” and that wagers can only be placed legally through licensed operators and sportsbooks.Separately, the GCGRA has also issued:Together, these moves show the UAE modernising its commercial gaming landscape with a regulated, consumer-safe framework rather than a permissive or unregulated market.At launch, Play971 is accessible primarily through its official website, rather than via public app stores. Users can register and play directly online, following identity verification and eligibility checks required by the UAE’s gaming regulator.As of now, no standalone mobile app has been publicly listed on major platforms such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This cautious approach aligns with the UAE’s tightly controlled regulatory rollout, ensuring compliance with responsible gaming and digital licensing standards before wider distribution.According to industry observers and regulatory context shared in official announcements, any future mobile app rollout, whether on iOS or Android, would require separate approvals from the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), as well as compliance with platform-specific policies.The availability of Play971 is also being introduced in phases, with access currently aligned to emirates and jurisdictions where regulatory readiness has been confirmed, including Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah. Wider nationwide access is expected to follow only after regulators complete further reviews of system performance, consumer safeguards, and operational compliance.Officials have stressed that users should avoid unlicensed apps or websites claiming to offer UAE-approved betting services, as Play971 remains the only legally licensed online sports wagering and iGaming platform in the country at this stage.With the national lottery, casino-resort projects, vendor license and now Play971, the UAE is slowly but deliberately building a regulated commercial gaming ecosystem that is secure and transparent for consumers and operators alike.","The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting.

Pilgrim safety during Hajj 2026

What should parents do?





The General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque in Saudi Arabia has launched a new child safety initiative at the holy site in Makkah this December. Under this programme, identification bracelets for children are now being issued to families as they enter the Grand Mosque complex. The goal is simple but powerful: ensure young pilgrims are quickly recognised and reunited with their guardians if they become lost or separated in the crowds.This initiative extends earlier versions of child wristband systems that were trialled and operated at key entrances in previous Umrah and Hajj seasons.The child safety bracelets are provided free of charge to families visiting the Grand Mosque with children. There is no online pre-registration required and no payment involved at any stage.Parents or guardians can obtain the bracelets on arrival at the Grand Mosque, where dedicated counters have been set up at key entry gates, including the King Abdulaziz Gate and King Fahd Gate (Gate 79). Trained staff from the mosque authority assist families at these points.The registration process is quick and done on the spot. Guardians are asked to provide basic contact details, such as a mobile phone number, which is then recorded on the bracelet.The bracelet is securely fastened to the child’s wrist before entry, ensuring the child can be easily identified if separated from their family.There is no age restriction specified, but the initiative is primarily aimed at young children, who are more vulnerable in dense crowds during Umrah and Hajj. Authorities strongly advise families with children to collect the bracelet before entering the prayer areas, especially during peak hours.Mosque officials have reiterated that the service is part of broader crowd-management and safety measures, and families are encouraged to use it as a preventive step rather than waiting for an emergency.The initiative is strongly encouraged for all guardians to utilize, especially during peak seasons when visitor numbers surge, such as the Holy Month of Ramadan and the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Authorities note that the system has successfully reduced reports of missing persons during these congested periods.Speaking on the objective of the program, officials have emphasized the importance of the service. Eng. Amjad Al-Hazmi, Deputy Head of the Presidency for Social and Voluntary Services, highlighted the organization’s ""utmost keenness on the provision of the finest and best services for the pilgrims"" and its commitment to ""raise the level of social responsibility."" Similarly, Khalid bin Fahad Al-Shalawi, Undersecretary-General for Social, Voluntary and Humanitarian Services, stated that the initiative ""supports parents and their children to perform their rituals peacefully. ""By providing this safety net, the Authority aims to give parents peace of mind, allowing them to focus fully on their spiritual obligations without the constant worry of losing their child in the crowd.Saudi authorities advise parents not to panic if a child becomes separated inside the Grand Mosque. With the safety bracelet in place, the recovery process is designed to be quick and orderly.If a child goes missing, parents should immediately inform the nearest security officer or mosque staff member and provide a description of the child. Staff are trained to look for the ID bracelet, which allows them to contact guardians directly using the information provided.Lost children are typically taken to designated assistance points inside the mosque complex, where trained personnel care for them until parents arrive. Authorities stress that most separations are resolved within a short time due to the coordinated system in place.This guidance helps parents understand that the bracelet works as part of a larger safety network, not as a standalone measure.Together with these innovations, the child bracelet programme reflects Saudi Arabia’s ongoing commitment to enhancing visitor experience while preserving safety, tradition, and hospitality at one of the world’s most sacred sites.","Saudi authorities advise parents not to panic if a child becomes separated inside the Grand Mosque.

999: For all life-threatening emergencies.

901: For non-emergency reports or inquiries.

Driving rules and fines

Reduce Speed: Motorists must slow down immediately. Wet roads significantly increase braking distance and the risk of aquaplaning (skidding). Driving in foggy weather without turning on vehicle lights can incur an AED 400 fine and four black points.

400 fine and four black points. Increase Distance: Maintain a sufficient safety gap. The standard three-second rule should be increased to a minimum of five seconds between your vehicle and the one ahead.

Use Proper Lighting: Turn on low-beam headlights and use fog lights when visibility drops. Never use high beams, as the light reflects off the water droplets or fog, reducing visibility for everyone.

Check Your Car: Before setting out, verify that your tires, brakes, and headlights are working properly. Crucially, ensure your windshield wipers are functional and the washer fluid tank is full.

Stay Focused: Maintain full attention on the road at all times.Taking photos or filming the rain while driving is a serious violation resulting in an AED 800 fine and four black points.

Mandatory water safety

Avoid Flood Zones: Residents must stay clear of valleys (Wadis), water channels, and any areas prone to flash floods. The depth and force of moving water are often misjudged; it can take less than 12 inches of rapidly moving water to sweep a car away. AED 1,000 fine and six black points for gathering near valleys and flood zones.

Do Not Go Near the Sea: The public is strongly advised to avoid beaches and to refrain from any sailing or marine activities. Rough seas and strong waves can pose severe threats to even experienced sea-goers. Driving into a closed road or flooded valley, ignoring the instructions of the competent authority, results in an AED 2,000 fine, 23 black points, and 60 days of vehicle impoundment.

Marine Vessels: Owners and operators of boats, ships, and yachts are urged to closely monitor the latest weather forecasts and strictly comply with all issued navigation and safety instructions before considering setting sail.

I know because he used his key fob to open the car, approached it and then something prompted him to back away. When he backed away he relocked the car.

I found that odd so when he circled the block I approached the car and that is when I saw the Florida plates.

He was parked in the section between the gate of the RIHS and the corner of Cooke and George St.""

Why was FBI unable to find the suspect for so long?





The investigation into the Brown University shooting took a major turn after a tip emerged on Reddit.A routine post on a discussion forum gave police the lead they needed to identify the suspect and trace his movements after the attack.The shooting occurred on December 13 inside an engineering building on Brown University’s campus in Providence, Rhode Island. A gunman entered a classroom where students were preparing for final exams and opened fire, killing two people and injuring nine others. The attack was jointly being probed by local officers and federal agencies. Classes were cancelled and the campus was placed on lockdown.The breakthrough came when a Reddit user, known only as “John,” began posting about what he had seen near the crime scene. He described a man acting suspiciously close to a grey Nissan with Florida number plates parked nearby. The detail seemed minor, but the Reddit community urged the user to share the details with the authorities. And it turns out, it was all they needed.Investigators confirmed that the Reddit post provided a very important lead, which was overlooked even by the FBI. Using the description of the vehicle, police were able to track it through a network of street cameras in the city.This allowed them to reconstruct and trace the suspect’s movements easily before and after the shooting and connect him to evidence that had not previously been linked.Finally, the trail led authorities to the suspected gunman, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old man who was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a storage unit in New Hampshire. Authorities ended the manhunt right there and confirmed the lifeless individual responsible for the Brown University shooting.Here is what the Reddit post said:Authorities have not confirmed whether the Reddit user will receive the reward for the tip. The FBI had offered $50,000 for any info leading to an arrest or conviction.Rhode Island’s attorney general acknowledged the Reddit tip, saying it had effectively “blown the case wide open.” Once investigators had the vehicle information other pieces of the investigation quickly fell into place like a jigsaw puzzle.Authorities are also investigating whether the dead suspect Neves Valente was involved in another killing that occurred just days after the Brown University shooting. This incident involved a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor, Nuno F.G. Loureiro, and police are exploring a possible connection between the two cases.In the days following the shooting, progress was very slow, with little to no information available, as only a single, grainy CCTV image of the suspect had been captured. There were 800 surveillance cameras on the university campus; however, none were positioned near the old building where the shooting actually took place.The police released the limited surveillance images, but the suspect’s identity remained unknown. The shooter had worn a mask and moved quickly, leaving behind little physical evidence.In a video that went viral on social media, dozens of FBI agents were seen kicking snow near the campus in search of any physical evidence that may have been left behind by the suspect. However, they were trolled online, with users saying the authorities would never catch the shooter at this rate.","The investigation into the Brown University shooting took a major turn after a tip emerged on Reddit.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google confirms Gemini will replace Assistant on Android in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-confirms-gemini-will-replace-assistant-on-android-in-2026/articleshow/126096509.cms,"Transition timeline



Google initially planned to complete the upgrade by the end of 2025.

The company now says the migration will continue into 2026, citing the need to avoid disruption during the holiday season and to ensure feature parity between Assistant and Gemini.

The rollout is expected to be gradual and region-based, rather than an immediate global switch.

What Gemini brings



Already available on Wear OS, Google TV, and Android Auto, Gemini is expanding into smart speakers and displays via the Gemini for Home Early Access program.

The platform integrates advanced features like NotebookLM support, AI video detection, and semantic search, positioning it as a more powerful replacement for Assistant.

Why the delay



Feature Parity: Ensuring Gemini incorporates all of Assistant’s core functions before migration. Timing: Avoiding major platform changes during the holiday season, when disruption could frustrate users.

Context and significance



Google Assistant first launched in 2016, making the 2026 replacement symbolic as it marks a decade of service.

The move underscores Google’s broader strategy to embed Generative AI deeply into everyday consumer experiences.

For users, the shift promises smarter search, richer media integration, and more natural interactions, though some may miss the familiarity of Assistant.





Google has announced that its Gemini AI platform will fully replace Google Assistant on Android devices in 2026, pushing back its earlier timeline to allow for a more seamless migration. The change will affect Android phones, tablets, and even the standalone iOS app, which will be phased out once Gemini takes over.Gemini represents Google’s next-generation AI assistant, designed to deliver more conversational, visual, and context-aware experiences.Google has not provided a detailed explanation, but industry observers suggest two main reasons:","Gemini represents Google’s next-generation AI assistant, designed to deliver more conversational, visual, and context-aware experiences.

Not Meta-like $100 million pay packages: The ‘biggest’ reason why Google’s ex-employees are returning to company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-meta-like-100-million-pay-packages-the-biggest-reason-why-googles-ex-employees-are-returning-to-company/articleshow/126092200.cms,"Google has deep pockets and computational infrastructure





As the Silicon Valley ‘AI talent war’ escalates into a multi-billion dollar bidding power struggle, Google has successfully deployed a ‘boomerang’ strategy to bring its top minds back to the company. While rivals like Meta and OpenAI are offering astronomical signing bonuses as mush as $100 million, Google is winning back its former staffers with a different kind of currency: Robust computational infrastructureCiting data, CNBC reported that approximately 20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were former employees. This suggests that for the world’s elite engineers, the ability to build is becoming more valuable than a massive immediate paychecks.The report also said that during a recent internal meeting, Google’s head of compensation, John Casey, addressed the trend directly, noting that AI researchers are increasingly drawn back to Google's “deep pockets” and its unparalleled “hefty computational infrastructure.”Google is uniquely positioned as an “all-in-one” provider with its own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a Cloud to host AI models, and even products to help it infuse its AI services, giving it an edge that cash alone cannot buy.“We’re energized by our momentum, compute and talent. Engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.Apart from salary and infrastructure, Google has spent months in eliminating over one-third of middle-management roles to speed up product shipping. Co-founder Sergey Brin came out of retirement to personally call and recruit top-tier candidates. More recently, the success of Gemini 3 has provided the company an edge after a rocky start in 2022.Recently, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who is the co-founder of DeepMind, also acknowledged the shortage of AI talent, saying that this has led to a constant “rotation” of experts between the “Big Five” tech firms.","20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were former employees.
