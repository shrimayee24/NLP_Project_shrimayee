What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

WhatsApp is dropping its native Windows app that Microsoft exec called “exemplary modern Windows app”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-is-dropping-its-native-windows-app-that-microsoft-exec-called-exemplary-modern-windows-app/articleshow/122819986.cms,"Representative image



Why WhatsApp is changing its app on Windows

What’s new with the WhatsApp web wrapper app on Windows 11

Meta has quietly rolled back WhatsApp's native Windows 11 application, replacing it with a Chromium-based web wrapper that sacrifices performance for development convenience.

The original app was celebrated by Microsoft executives, including former Windows chief Panos Panay, as an exemplary modern Windows application.Meta's own support documentation ironically contradicts this decision, stating that native apps ""provide increased performance and reliability"" along with superior notification experiences, calling capabilities, and screen sharing functionality. The web-based replacement offers a more basic settings interface and altered notification behavior that feels disconnected from Windows 11's design language.The beta version include some advantage over the previous app, bringing WhatsApp Channels and enhanced Status and Communities features that were previously available only through the web interface. However, these additions come at the cost of the streamlined, integrated experience that made the native Windows app distinctive.The transition also allows Meta to maintain a single codebase across all platforms rather than developing platform-specific applications.Meta has not announced when the web-based version will replace the current native app for all users.","Meta has quietly rolled back WhatsApp's native Windows 11 application.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas.

The Symbolism of Dates





Heritage Through the Dallah













In Oman, sharing a cup of qahwa is much more than enjoying a hot beverage. It is a deeply rooted cultural ritual that reflects the nation’s rich heritage, values of generosity, and communal warmth. From the moment it is brewed to the final pour, every step of serving qahwa is laden with symbolism, from the spices used to the way guests are addressed. Based on insights and cultural analyses, we explore how this fragrant ritual binds families, friends, and communities across the sultanate.The term qahwa (or kahwa) in Arabic simply means coffee, but in Oman the concept encompasses tradition, togetherness, and respect. According to Oman Observe, offering qahwa to guests marks the beginning of hospitality and welcomes them with open hearts. The ritual often includes serving freshly made qahwa alongside Omani dates, halwa (sweet), fruits, pastries, and sometimes nuts, creating a ceremonial spread that invites connection and conversationCulture Trip underscores this cultural pull, emphasizing that the act of preparing and serving qahwa is embedded in everyday Omani life. It is a slow, deliberate expression of generosity that defines communal identity.Unlike many global coffee styles, Omani qahwa is light in colour yet rich in aroma and flavour. It is traditionally prepared using lightly roasted beans, ground fresh with cardamom and often infused with saffron, rosewater, cloves, or cinnamon reflecting regional variation.The coffee is brewed in a dallah, a tall metal pot emblematic of Omani heritage and craftsmanship.Often shown in museum exhibits and cultural festivals as symbols of hospitality, dallahs tell the story of artisanal metalwork and enduring connection.Once brewed, qahwa is poured into small handle-less porcelain cups (finjan), filled to only one-quarter as a sign of respect and an invitation for another round. Guests signal they’ve had enough by gently shaking the cup before returning it.Guests entering an Omani home are welcomed into the majli, a gathering place for hospitality and storytelling. The host then offers dates, water to wash hands, followed by qahwa . Accepting at least one cup is customary, and refusing may be seen as disrespectful.In some households dating back generations, coffee is served before small talk; in others, the conversation precedes the pour. These subtle differences reflect Oman’s regional diversity, each area contributing its own customs to the broader tradition.Qahwa transcends home visits. It is served at business meetings, social gatherings, weddings, and religious ceremonies. In 2022, Oman hosted its first Omani Qahwa Competition during a hospitality expo, celebrating traditional preparation and encouraging its preservation. The event highlighted how coffee is not just a drink but an evolving cultural craft, passed through families, refined over generations.Service of qahwa is inseparable from dates, a staple of Omani agriculture and a sign of welcome. Dates balance the coffee’s natural bitterness and serve as a sweet overture to conversation and community. Oman is renowned for its date varieties like Khalas, Fardh, and others, each adding unique texture and flavour to the qahwa experience.The dallah is more than a functional pot, it is a symbol of Omani heritage. Exhibits like the U.S. Folklife Festival recognized Omani dallahs as cultural artefacts reflecting centuries of craftsmanship. In cities like Nizwa and Muscat, traditional metalworkers still produce dallahs by hand, preserving these techniques within local trades.Modern life in Oman blends qahwa tradition with contemporary culture. Majlis coffee corners in hotels, tourism centres, and museums now invite international guests to learn the etiquette and taste the flavours. Culinary tourism initiatives highlight such rituals, showing how Omani heritage remains alive and relevant.Omani qahwa is more than coffee; it is a sacred ritual that weaves together hospitality, history, and craftsmanship. From the careful selection of spice-infused brews to the artful preparation in ornate dallahs, every element speaks to Omani values of generosity, respect, and social unity. As Oman opens its doors to visitors and continues to promote its cultural heritage, the deep-rooted tradition of qahwa remains at the heart, proving that in Oman, every cup tells a story of warmth and connection.","In Oman, sharing a cup of qahwa is much more than enjoying a hot beverage.

This K-Pop band is making waves with sign language,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/this-k-pop-band-is-making-waves-with-sign-language/articleshow/122803209.cms,"All members — Lee Chan-yeon, Park Hyun-jin, Kim Ji-seok — are hard of hearing





Like other K-pop sensations, Big Ocean sings, raps, dances and attracts swooning fans. But this new group’s meteoric rise is fueled by a skill it seems no other boy band boasts: signing. Band members — Lee Chan-yeon, 27, Park Hyun-jin, 25, and Kim Ji-seok, 22 — are all deaf or hard of hearing. They use the latest audio technology to help make their music, coordinate their choreography with flashing metronomes and vibrating watches, and incorporate Korean Sign Language into videos and performances.“Just like divers rely on signs to communicate underwater, we use sign language to convey meaning where sound alone might fall short,” Lee said. “For us, KSL is not just an element — it’s the heart of our performance.” The group released their debut single, “Glow,” last year, on Korea’s Day of People with Disabilities, and they did their first televised performance incorporating KSL. Soon after, they followed up with “Blow,” a single heavy on English lyrics and American Sign Language.In Sept, they were named Billboard’s rookies of the month, and recently, they made the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia Entertainment & Sports List.This month, the band performed at an anime festival in Brazil and at a UN tech event in Switzerland before touring Europe for the second time since spring. Their first American tour starts later this month. Big Ocean has 995,000 followers on Instagram and more than 696,000 on TikTok. Fans, who call themselves “Pados” after Korean word for wave, are devoted, and many are learning sign languages from the band, which makes numerous tutorials. But fame was never assured, said Haley Cha, CEO of Parastar Entertainment, Big Ocean’s management company.Even the members sometimes questioned their dream, Cha added. They had alternate careers, and it was not always clear to them or to others what they could achieve in music. Cha said she used a variety of tactics to help them visualise stardom, including taking images of established K-pop idols and replacing the faces with those of the trio.Some in the deaf community, however, worry about the framing of the band, particularly for hearing audiences, as an inspirational narrative about “overcoming” disability that could undermine deaf identity.For their part, the trio’s members seem delighted they inspire people and heartened by the world’s response.","Big Ocean has 995,000 followers on Instagram and more than 696,000 on TikTok.

Dell’s Matt McGowan on how gamers are shaping the Alienware machines: They’re not afraid to tell us what works and what doesn’t,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dells-matt-mcgowan-on-how-gamers-are-shaping-the-alienware-machines-theyre-not-afraid-to-tell-us-what-works-and-what-doesnt/articleshow/122826940.cms,"Built with, not just for, gamers

Made for India, not just available in India

Gaming PCs has a new co-designer: The player

Gamers have always chased power. But today, as per Dell 's Matt McGowan , who leads Alienware at Dell, they’re asking for more than just high frame rates. In a world where specs are no longer the sole currency of performance, experience has become the new battleground. From the look and feel of a laptop to the way it sounds, responds, and immerses, it all matters. And brands like Alienware are taking notes, not from a lab, but from their users, says McGowan.“We don’t just build machines, we’re trying to set the stage for where gaming is going,” says Matt McGowan , General Manager, Alienware, as he sits down for a chat with Times of India . “Specs still matter, but gamers aspire to more, they want devices that feel futuristic, personal, and culturally resonant.”At Alienware, it’s visible in keyboards co-designed with the community, device tuning that reflects regional preferences, and even aesthetic changes made for a market as specific as India. Dell, through Alienware, is listening — really listening, says McGowan — to a community that’s growing more diverse, more vocal, and more influential by the day.“Community has always mattered, but it matters more now than ever,” says Matt McGowan, Global Product Lead at Dell Technologies . “Gamers are sophisticated. They’re not just asking for specs, they’re asking for specific tactile feedback, thermal control, sound design. And they’re not afraid to tell us what works and what doesn’t.”One standout example of this ethos is the Cherry MX ultra-low profile mechanical keyboard that now ships with Alienware laptops. It wasn’t a feature cooked up in a boardroom, it was born out of real demand from the gaming community. Dell partnered with Cherry, the renowned German switch maker, and together spent 18 to 24 months perfecting the switch design.“People wanted mechanical feel on laptops, which is incredibly hard to deliver given the constraints,” McGowan explains. “We didn’t take the easy route. We didn’t just slap in a switch. We engineered it from scratch, because users told us that’s what they wanted.”This isn’t an isolated case. Several features on Alienware’s flagship machines, from ventilation design to display tuning, have their roots in user feedback loops. Even earlier, Dell built an external graphics amplifier in response to gamers who wanted desktop-level performance in portable form, an idea well ahead of its time when it launched nearly a decade ago.The traditional model—build, release, market—isn’t enough anymore. Today’s most successful hardware brands treat their communities like collaborators, not customers. And Alienware, long regarded as a “for-the-elite” label, is increasingly opening its doors.“We don’t always get it perfect,” McGowan admits. “But what we try to do is listen, iterate, and be transparent about our design choices. We want our users to feel like they helped make the thing they’re buying. Because in many ways, they did.”While Dell continues to co-create with gamers globally, it’s India that’s emerging as one of the most influential markets in shaping Alienware’s direction. For a country long treated as an afterthought in premium tech rollouts, this marks a pivotal shift.With the launch of the new Alienware Aurora desktop, Dell is doing more than expanding availability, it’s adapting design decisions specifically to meet Indian gamers’ needs. And that’s not just marketing speak. It’s visible in the product itself.“We actually removed chassis lighting from the Aurora,” McGowan says. “That’s a first for Alienware. We always had it. But the research from India told us loud and clear, what gamers here value most is performance for price. So we prioritised performance.”In a market that’s deeply price-sensitive but rapidly growing in PC gaming adoption, this decision reflects a nuanced understanding. By stripping out some of the “premium frills,” Dell has managed to retain the performance ethos of Alienware while lowering the barrier to entry for Indian gamers.This isn’t about cheapening the product, McGowan emphasises. “It’s still a quality machine. But we’ve made very intentional choices so that more people can afford that level of power. We want Alienware to be aspirational, but also accessible.”The company sees India as a market that not only matters in terms of numbers, but in terms of future direction. “India was a huge contributor as we looked at the new product strategy,” McGowan says. “From pricing to feature prioritisation, we had to get it right for India—and that ended up helping us build a better product globally.”Dell’s internal data likely backs up this confidence. India’s gaming PC market has seen double-digit growth, with a swelling base of Gen Z and Millennial gamers entering the ecosystem. These users may not always buy the highest-end model, but they’re extremely vocal, deeply informed, and eager to engage with brands that take them seriously.And Alienware wants to be that brand.“We want to own the gaming mindshare in India,” McGowan says. “That doesn’t mean we expect every gamer to buy Alienware today. But when they think of the best gaming experience—that’s the association we want to build. And we know we have to earn it.”Alienware’s latest moves are part of a broader industry pattern: high-end gaming brands are adapting to a more demanding and diverse audience. India’s growing influence in product decisions, once unthinkable for top-tier devices, is now shaping how global companies define value, performance, and design.What stands out isn’t just that Dell is localising or “India-fying” its products. It’s that India is now baked into the global product strategy, right alongside Europe and the US. The result is hardware that feels less like it was made for a distant, idealised gamer, and more like it was built with real users in mind.Whether that leads to deeper adoption or just better hardware across the board remains to be seen. But one thing’s clear: the days of designing in a vacuum are over. Gamers, from community forums to fast-growing markets like India, are now seated at the design table. And that’s a welcome change to see.","Gamers are asking for more than just high frame rates. Brands like Alienware are taking notes, not from a lab, but from their users.

Dubai’s switch to cubic meters for water bills: Why it matters more this summer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-switch-to-cubic-meters-for-water-bills-why-it-matters-more-this-summer/articleshow/122794842.cms,"DEWA updates its billing units to cubic meters, aligning Dubai with global water measurement standards/Representative Image

TL;DR:

DEWA replaced gallons with cubic meters for water billing in March 2025.





The change aligns with global standards and simplifies consumption tracking for residents. Summer months typically cause about 18% surge in water usage in the UAE, making this metric shift especially timely.

No change in water tariffs, only the measurement unit is different.













Why Did DEWA Make the Switch?





Has Pricing Changed?

How Residents Can Track Their Usage

View daily, weekly, and monthly water usage.





Receive alerts on unusual consumption spikes.





Compare usage against similar households.









A Regional Comparison

Abu Dhabi’s ADDC (Abu Dhabi Distribution Company) uses cubic meters for water billing.





Saudi Arabia’s National Water Company also uses cubic meters.





Qatar’s Kahramaa follows the metric system.





Bahrain, however, continues to use gallons, though a news report from June 2025 indicates that a switch to cubic meters is under consideration for 2026 to standardize measurements across the region.







Why Measurement Matters









Dubai’s ongoing efforts to improve sustainability and transparency took a notable step in March 2025, when the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) transitioned its water billing units from gallons to cubic meters. While initially seen as a technical tweak, the change is proving particularly useful now, as residents face the UAE's hottest months when water consumption spikes.According to the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy’s 2025 Mid-Year Review, water usage in the emirate typically increases during summer (June to September) due to higher demand for cooling, irrigation, and personal use. This makes the cubic meter-based billing system a timely tool for both locals and expats trying to better manage costs and consumption.The switch to cubic meters was officially announced by DEWA in March 2025, aligning Dubai's utility billing with global norms where cubic meters are the standard metric unit for water measurement. The earlier system based on imperial gallons often confused residents unfamiliar with non-metric measurements.One cubic meter equals 1,000 liters, roughly 220 imperial gallons, providing a clearer and more relatable unit for residents who wish to monitor and adjust their consumption patterns.DEWA emphasized that the change aims to enhance transparency, simplify billing, and support sustainability goals set under Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050.Despite the unit shift, DEWA has confirmed that tariff rates remain unchanged. Consumers are paying the same per cubic meter as they previously did per the equivalent gallon-based metric. This was clearly outlined in DEWA’s official statement on the change.The update is administrative, aimed at measurement clarity rather than cost increase. The tiered pricing system based on slab consumption continues as before, with higher usage resulting in higher per-unit charges.Summer in the UAE sees a considerable uptick in resource consumption, particularly water. The Dubai Statistics Center’s 2024 Annual Report noted that water consumption typically rises by 18-20% during summer months, driven by air conditioning cooling systems, gardening, and increased household use.This trend has already been observed in June and July 2025, where DEWA's smart meters have recorded above-average usage compared to earlier in the year, as per DEWA’s internal consumption bulletins shared in June 2025.To help residents stay informed, DEWA offers the Smart Living Program via its smart app, where users can:Since the shift to cubic meters, these tools have become more intuitive for residents who were previously unfamiliar with gallon-based measurements.Dubai is not alone in adopting cubic meters. In the wider GCC region:Switching to cubic meters is not merely a bureaucratic update, it helps residents make international comparisons, better understand their environmental footprint, and align with Dubai’s 30% water use reduction target by 2030, part of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050.As sustainability and climate resilience become priorities, particularly in water-scarce regions like the Gulf, empowering residents with transparent metrics can help curb overconsumption.While DEWA’s switch from gallons to cubic meters may have seemed like a quiet policy update back in March, its practical benefits are clearer today as Dubai faces peak summer demand. With clearer units and smart monitoring tools, residents are now better equipped to track and control water use, aligning personal utility savings with broader environmental goals.",Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) transitioned its water billing units from gallons to cubic meters in March 2025.

According to DataReportal's 2025 UAE Digital Report, the UAE has over 99% internet penetration, while Saudi Arabia also exceeds 99%, fuelling on-demand content consumption across platforms like Shahid VIP, Netflix, StarzPlay Arabia, and Amazon Prime Video.A report by Statista indicates that over 57% of UAE residents subscribe to at least one paid streaming service, while in Saudi Arabia, the figure is about 48%, reflecting both demand and market potential. The presence of a culturally diverse workforce in the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain drives platforms to balance between Arabic, English, Hindi, and Tagalog content offerings.Shahid VIP, owned by Saudi Arabia’s MBC Group, continues to dominate Arabic-language streaming in the GCC.In 2025, it boasts more than 3 million subscribers, per MBC Group's March 2025 statement, thanks to exclusive Arabic series, live TV channels, and original productions tailored to Gulf sensibilities.Similarly, StarzPlay Arabia, headquartered in the UAE, maintains its strong foothold with over 2.1 million active subscribers. StarzPlay is favoured not just for its English-language catalogue but also for partnerships that stream Bollywood films, Turkish dramas, and cricket tournaments like the PSL, catering heavily to the South Asian expat audience.StarzPlay's partnership with Etisalat and STC allows for bundled subscriptions, increasing affordability and reach, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.While Netflix remains a dominant global player, it has intensified efforts to localise content in the Middle East. In January 2025, Netflix announced an expanded slate of Arabic Originals, including Saudi-produced thrillers and Emirati family dramas. According to Netflix, Arabic-language content consumption on the platform has grown by 40% year-on-year, especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Netflix’s focus on regional storytelling aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which aims to elevate local entertainment industries. This localisation strategy has enhanced its appeal among Gulf nationals and second-generation expats fluent in Arabic.Expats in the GCC continue to shape streaming preferences. South Asian workers in the UAE and Qatar heavily consume Bollywood films and Indian web series on platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, although access can vary based on local licensing.Filipino expats largely use iWantTFC, a global Filipino content platform, which reports steady growth in GCC subscriptions as of ABS-CBN’s 2025 mid-year update.Moreover, Turkish dramas dubbed in Arabic, available on Shahid VIP and StarzPlay, remain perennially popular with Arab and non-Arab expats alike. This cross-cultural appeal helps platforms retain diverse demographics.One key constraint for streaming services in the Gulf remains censorship. Both UAE and Saudi Arabia have content regulations that restrict or edit scenes involving nudity, LGBTQ+ themes, and excessive violence. According to Arab News, platforms operating in the GCC must comply with National Media Council guidelines in the UAE and equivalent Saudi regulatory frameworks.This leads to edited versions of global shows, though some platforms provide advisory notices on such edits. Such content moderation has not significantly dampened subscriptions, as users weigh content access alongside regional values.Pricing remains a decisive factor. As of July 2025, here's a snapshot of monthly subscription fees in the UAE (approximate USD conversion):Bundled telecom packages often reduce these costs further. For example, Etisalat’s eLife package includes StarzPlay access, while STC offers Shahid VIP subscriptions with specific plans.In 2025, the Gulf’s streaming ecosystem is dynamic and expat-driven, yet increasingly regionalised. Platforms that blend high-quality Arabic originals with popular global content are thriving, while telecom bundling strategies keep services affordable. As more Gulf countries invest in media and entertainment, the content landscape is set to grow further, serving a cosmopolitan viewer base that toggles between K-dramas, Bollywood hits, Arabic thrillers, and Premier League football.","Shahid VIP and StarzPlay Arabia lead the GCC’s streaming race, with driving demand for Bollywood, Arabic, and Turkish content. Expats favour a mix of global hits and tailored regional content, from Bollywood to Turkish dramas. Regional content production is rising, with Saudi Arabia and UAE leading Arabic originals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122795832,imgsize-188545,width-400,resizemode-4/122795832.jpg"

TL;DR

Kids spend more time on gaming apps during summer, raising cybercrime risks.

Dubai Police urge parents to take a more hands-on role in supervising digital habits.

urge parents to take a more hands-on role in supervising digital habits. Parental controls , content awareness, and honest conversations are key to safety.

What’s the Risk?



Strangers in Disguise: Online games often come with chat features or message boards. These can be used by adults pretending to be kids. Some may try to get personal details, others might build trust before exploiting it. Fraud and Extortion: Dubai Police report cases where children are tricked into sharing personal photos or private info. Scammers may then use this to blackmail or manipulate them. Cyberbullying and Mental Health: Toxic online environments can leave kids stressed, anxious, or feeling isolated. For some, gaming addiction becomes a real issue, affecting sleep, grades, and relationships.

What Parents Can Actually Do

Turn On Parental Controls: Most devices and games have built-in safety settings. Use them. They help block harmful content, limit in-game purchases, and manage chat features. Set Time Limits That Stick: Not every hour online is bad, but balance matters. Choose clear time frames for gaming and stick to them. Set boundaries that allow for breaks, reading, or physical play. Know the Games They Play: Before saying yes to a download, check the age rating and reviews. Some games appear child-friendly but include violent or explicit content or allow strangers to connect directly. Keep the Conversation Open: Talk to your kids. Ask who they’re playing with. Let them know it’s okay to come to you if something online makes them uncomfortable. Offer Real-World Alternatives: Organize time for hobbies, books, outings, or summer activities. Kids turn to screens when there’s nothing else to do.

FAQ

1. What signs should I look for if my child is being targeted online?

2. Are all video games dangerous?

3. What if my child already shared something online by mistake?





When school’s out, screens are in. In the UAE, summer means longer hours indoors, and for many kids, that translates to more time spent playing video games online. While this might seem harmless at first glance, Dubai Police are raising serious concerns. The Cybercrime Department is warning that the summer surge in screen time also increases the risk of online threats, fraud, cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and even contact with predators. And it doesn’t take much. A simple in-game chat or click on a message can open the door to danger.That’s why authorities are calling on parents to get more involved. Not later, now. Children aren’t always equipped to handle the risks of unsupervised digital play. So parental guidance isn’t just helpful, it’s necessary. This isn’t about fear. It’s about being aware, staying present, and knowing how to act.Why Gaming Isn’t Always Just Fun and GamesIf you think your child has been exposed to online threats, don’t wait. Dubai Police offer multiple ways to report or seek guidance:You can also find bilingual resources (Arabic & English) on the platform, tailored for parents, kids, and even business users, to help you understand and prevent cybercrime.Changes in mood, secrecy about gaming, withdrawal, or sudden anxiety around devices can all be signs something’s off. Stay observant.No. Many are safe and even educational. The issue is with unsupervised play, access to chat features, and games that aren’t age-appropriate.Stay calm. Let them know they’re not in trouble.

After nearly 12 years since its global debut in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and GTA Online have finally launched in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on July 17, 2025. The launch comes with a newly implemented 21+ age rating, a regulatory milestone that has enabled the full, uncensored version of the game to be released in the Gulf.The official release spans PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC, both in digital and physical formats. Despite its controversial content, GTA V now enjoys legal status in both countries after years of being available only through imported discs or foreign digital accounts.The official announcement was made via PlayStation Arabia’s X (formerly Twitter) account, which invited players to “experience the ultimate entertainment,” marking a historic moment for Gulf-based fans who have waited more than a decade for a legal release.Though never officially “banned,” GTA V was effectively blocked in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to strict media regulations around mature content. The main barriers to release included:Even titles like the GTA Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 only gained approval years after their international releases, underlining the slow, case-by-case scrutiny applied to mature games.The turning point in GTA V’s approval came with the introduction of a new 21+ age rating, a global first that is higher than the standard 18+ rating found in most other countries. This classification permits the release of unedited adult content without requiring changes to game mechanics or narratives. Although localized age ratings were first introduced in 2016, they were insufficient to clear GTA V under the previous standards.The upgraded classification was formally approved by Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Media Regulation (GAMR) and the UAE Media Council following direct consultations with Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive.This release is also tied to a new distribution agreement between Take-Two and Advanced Initiative Company, a Saudi firm that will now serve as the official distributor for all Take-Two titles in the region, including GTA, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and Red Dead Redemption.The deal not only enabled the long-awaited launch of GTA V but also paves the way for future releases to arrive in the Gulf without the delays that have historically plagued mature-rated titles.No, the game remains largely unaltered. Thanks to the newly introduced 21+ age rating, GTA V has been approved in its full form, including all depictions of violence, firearms, mature language and themes, without any cuts or content modifications. This higher classification was specifically created to allow adult-themed games to pass regulatory scrutiny without being edited, and GTA V is one of the first major titles to benefit from this shift.However, one major exception remains: gambling-related content. Since 2019, all casino features in GTA Online have been explicitly prohibited in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to religious and legal restrictions on gambling. As a result, the Diamond Casino & Resort, a virtual location within the game where players can engage in betting activities, remains disabled in both countries. Players attempting to access the casino will encounter an in-game message stating that the feature is unavailable in their region.This is consistent with broader policy in the Gulf, where other global games with gambling mechanics, such as card packs, loot boxes, or virtual betting, are also often restricted or adjusted for compliance. While the 21+ rating provides greater flexibility for adult content, it does not override strict anti-gambling laws, which continue to be enforced without exception.The approval of GTA V marks a significant cultural shift in how Saudi Arabia and the UAE approach adult-oriented games, setting the stage for GTA VI to potentially launch in sync with its global release on May 26, 2026. This milestone aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which emphasizes investment in digital entertainment and esports as part of broader economic diversification.While the core content of GTA V remains uncensored thanks to the new 21+ age rating, future titles like GTA VI may still face localized restrictions on specific missions or features. However, with studies showing that over 90% of gamers in the MENA region are above the age of 21, the market is clearly ready for mature-rated titles at scale.On July 17, 2025, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.No, except for casino content, all features remain intact and uncensored.Because gambling is prohibited under the laws and religious norms of both countries.A special 21+ age rating, higher than the typical 18+ used elsewhere.Most likely, as this release sets a precedent for smoother, timely approvals.","GTA V and GTA Online officially launched in Saudi Arabia and UAE on July 17, 2025, after a 12-year delay.

FAQs

1. When will the mountain road open?

2. What can visitors expect from the climate on this route?

3. Will the road benefit local residents?





Sharjah is taking steps to bring more visitors to its mountain areas during the cooler months. The new road project announced by the ruler, Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohamed Al Qasimi, will connect the city of Khorfakkan to its highest mountain peak, offering travelers an escape from the usual heat of the UAE.This isn’t just about building a road. It’s about creating a new kind of journey that blends nature, culture, and comfort, especially during winter, when the mountain climate is mild and inviting. The road will wind over hills and peaks, surrounded by trees, water channels, and small homes, making it a peaceful and scenic drive.Winter tourism means visitors look for places where the weather is pleasant and outdoor activities are possible without the harsh sun or extreme heat. Khorfakkan’s mountain peak stands at 1,100 meters, which means temperatures here are cooler than the coastal city below.The new road takes advantage of this by offering a travel route where people can enjoy fresh air, green scenery, and calm surroundings. Unlike crowded city spots or busy beaches, this mountain road promises a quieter experience. The trees and plantations planted along the way will add to the feeling of being in nature, making it ideal for winter visitors who want to relax or explore.The plan is to turn a simple highway into a tourist-friendly route. The road will have water canals and hillside residences, making the journey visually appealing. It’s designed to encourage visitors to stop, take in the views, and enjoy the environment.Besides tourists, the route will also serve the local villages scattered across the mountains. These communities often don’t get much attention, but better road access could bring them new visitors and help their economies. Small businesses like cafes, craft shops, or guided tours could benefit from this.This mountain road fits well with Sharjah’s bigger vision for the region. Khorfakkan has been gaining recognition as a cultural and eco-tourism hub. For example, the nearby Faya Palaeolandscape was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List earlier this month, drawing attention to the area’s unique natural and historical value.The new road will make it easier for tourists to reach these sites and enjoy what Khorfakkan offers beyond its coastlines.

FAQs

Q1: Why is Dubai labeling AI content?

Q2: How is AI being used in UAE health services?

Q3: Will AI replace government leaders in the UAE?





Dubai just became the first city in the world to roll out a formal system that tells you whether content was made by a human, a machine, or both. It’s not just a label, it’s a new way of thinking about transparency in the digital age. But this is only one piece of a much bigger picture.Across the UAE, artificial intelligence is quietly becoming part of daily life. It’s helping design cycling helmets, manage traffic, assist in government decisions, and even plan your dinner. Unlike many countries that are still debating the risks of AI, the UAE is putting it to work in clear, controlled, and sometimes surprising ways.From a content labeling system to smart parking meters, here’s how the UAE is building one of the most AI-integrated societies in the world.On July 16, Dubai introduced the Human-Machine Collaboration Icons, a global-first system that shows who or what, made a piece of content. There are five main icons, each showing a different level of human and machine involvement. These range from “All Human” to “All Machine.”There are also nine additional tags that show where in the process the machine stepped in, things like data collection, writing, or visual design.What’s important here isn’t just the icons, it’s the message. This is Dubai saying: if machines are part of your creative process, be upfront about it.Not just this innovation, let’s take a quick look at some of the recent AI developments across the UAE that show how the country is bringing artificial intelligence into many parts of daily life.At this year’s Tour de France, the UAE Team Emirates–XRG debuted a cycling helmet made using generative AI. The helmet wasn’t just designed for looks. AI helped map airflow and friction, making the helmet lighter and faster. This came out of a collaboration between Abu Dhabi-based G42 and Italian helmet maker MET.In Abu Dhabi, a new AI-powered parking system means no more worrying about tickets or meters. Cameras and smart sensors track car movements, manage payments automatically, and help drivers find spots in real time. It’s faster, easier, and requires no physical interaction.Starting 2026, the UAE will add an AI advisory system to its federal cabinet. This isn’t science fiction. The AI won’t vote, but it will give data-backed advice, predict outcomes, and help fine-tune decisions. It's a move to bring speed and precision into government thinking.Dubai’s healthcare system is moving towards prevention. A new WhatsApp-based platform now lets people check their health risks from home. AI tools are monitoring heart rate, stress levels, and other indicators spotting issues early before symptoms appear. The Ministry of Health is also using virtual assistants and biometric tracking for wide-scale screening.Opening soon in Dubai: a restaurant where the menu is designed by AI. “Chef Aiman” isn’t human, but it’s trained in food science, sustainability, and global cuisines. Human chefs still do the cooking, but the AI handles creativity, pairing, and planning.What’s different about the UAE’s approach is the quiet, steady rollout. Instead of flashy promises or hypothetical demos, they’re putting AI into real places, helmets, traffic lights, chat apps, menus.There’s also a strong focus on structure and transparency. Systems like the content classification icons show that the country wants AI to be understandable, not just useful.To make it clear whether content is made by people, machines, or both. It helps build trust and prevents confusion.Through WhatsApp-based risk checks, virtual AI assistants, and biometric tools that monitor heart rate, stress, and more.No. The AI will act as an advisor, offering quick data analysis and feedback to help improve decisions.","Dubai launched a world-first system to label human vs AI-generated content.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
