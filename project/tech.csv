The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

NEW DELHI: In just under three months, you will not be able to maintain your desktop/computer login on communication apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Snapchat for more than six hours at a stretch. You will have to re-login using the QR code provided by the app provider. Also, if you try to log into your communication apps on smartphones without the SIM card on which you first downloaded the app, it will not connect.This follows new orders issued by govt that say that communication apps should not allow connections on smartphones where the SIM card on which the user was originally identified is missing. The move is being taken to counter cyber fraud. Companies have to comply or face penalties. ""Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 , the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws,"" govt said.The department of telecom said the current set-up was being misused by cyber fraudsters. ""... it has come to the notice of central govt that some of the app-based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services, allows users to consume their services without availability of the underlying Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) within the device in which app-based communication services is running,"" the department of telecom said, adding that the feature was posing a challenge to telecom cyber security ""as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds"".DoT said it had become necessary to issue the directions to prevent the misuse of telecommunication identifiers and to safeguard the integrity and security of the telecom ecosystem.DoT issued the orders on Nov 21. ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure that the app-based communication services are continuously linked to the SIM card (associated with mobile number used for identification of customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services) installed in the device, making it impossible to use the app without that specific, active SIM,"" it said.On the web service on computers, it said, ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure the web service instance of the mobile app, if provided, shall be logged out periodically (not later than 6 hours) and allow the facility to the user to re-link the device using QR code.""It asked the companies to submit compliance reports within 120 days from the issue of the directions.","You will have to re-login using the QR code provided by the app provider.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo sent to employees.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units. Despite Google's stock hitting all-time highs and rising over 120% since April, while Nvidia's shares dipped following the competitive news, Nvidia emphasised its leadership position, noting it remains 'a generation ahead of the industry.'","Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

How to clear Gmail storage quickly and effectively

Empty the Trash and Spam folders

Delete large emails and attachments

Remove newsletters and old promotional emails

Use the Google One Storage Manager to clear space across all services

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to Trash and stay there for up to 30 days. They still count towards storage until the Trash is emptied. The same applies to the Spam folder. By opening each folder and selecting the option to permanently delete all items, users often free up space instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow.

"Indian student shares visuals of world class government canteen with free drinks, international food all at Rs 250",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/indian-student-shares-visuals-of-world-class-government-canteen-with-free-drinks-international-food-all-at-rs-250/articleshow/125685314.cms,"An Indian medical student in China has sparked a massive online discussion after posting a video that challenges some of the most persistent stereotypes about Chinese food. The clip, shared by Komal Nigam on Instagram with the caption “Chinese Government University Canteen”, quickly went viral across platforms, not for unusual dishes, but for the sheer variety, affordability, and quality of food served in her university’s three-storey canteen. Scroll down to read more.In the video, Nigam begins by addressing a belief she says she hears often: that Chinese cuisine is dominated by insects, reptiles, and “unusual animals”. “Many people think that you only get insects, reptiles, and other unusual animals here, but that is not true,” she says, before shifting the camera toward an expansive dining space that looks more like a food court than a typical college canteen.What follows is a detailed walk-through of the canteen building, a structure that houses not just food counters but also, as she notes, an in-house restaurant serving comparatively expensive dishes. According to her, each floor offers a completely different style of food. The first floor leans towards standard Chinese meals, the second floor is a mix of noodles, desserts, drinks, and crowd-favourite snacks, while the third floor tends to be the preferred zone for Indian students.Her verdict on the overall spread: tasty enough to feature on a “5-star menu”.Towards the end of the clip, Nigam displays her entire meal for the day, plates generously filled and neatly arranged and reveals she paid only ₹250 for all of it. She adds that students also receive tea and a few beverages for free, something many viewers seemed particularly surprised by.The reactions online have been a mix of admiration, curiosity, and personal anecdotes. Some users echoed her sentiment about the food quality, calling the spread “surprisingly impressive.” Others chimed in with memories of their own experiences in Chinese universities and cafeterias, though not everyone had encountered similar meals. One user, in a translated comment, wrote, “I don’t think this is the entire truth, sister. When I was in China for business, I only ate fruits. I tried an Indian restaurant in Beijing, but everything had a meaty smell.” Another viewer questioned the pricing structure: “Wow! How are the foods so cheap? Is it subsidised?” There were also light-hearted replies from people imagining themselves in the same queue, with one joking, “Not me standing somewhere there in line saying ‘bu yao tang’ (don’t want soup).”The video also gained attention on YouTube, where Nigam maintains a channel documenting her life in China. Her profile describes her content as the daily experiences, “the good, the bad, and the hilarious”, of an international student pursuing an MBBS degree abroad. This latest clip seems to have resonated widely, not just for its visuals but for how it reframes assumptions about food culture in China, especially for Indian students navigating a new country.While the reactions differ, the consensus online is clear: a full Chinese canteen meal for ₹250, complete with complimentary drinks, is something most students around the world can only dream of. And if Nigam’s video is anything to go by, the “5-star” label might not be entirely an exaggeration.","Komal Nigam, an Indian medical student in China, posted a video of her canteen meal.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Tips to avoid accumulating black points





Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Yield to pedestrians and emergency vehicles at all times. Wear your seatbelt and ensure children are seated safely in the car. Avoid using your mobile phone while driving. Follow parking rules and avoid blocking fire hydrants or reserved spaces. Be extra cautious near school zones and bus stops. Regularly check your black points through apps, SMS notifications, or official websites.





Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, and who used his research to advise FBI interrogators and screeners for the Transportation Security Administration as well as Hollywood animators, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco. He was 91.Ekman sought to add scientific exactitude to the human impulse to interpret how others feel through their facial expressions. He recorded 18 types of smiles, for example, distinguishing between a forced smile and a spontaneous one; a genuine smile, he discovered, crinkles the orbicularis oculi muscle - that is, it creates crow's feet around the eyes.Sometimes described as the world's most famous face reader, Ekman was influential in reshaping the way facial expressions were understood - as the product of evolution rather than environment - and his findings crossed over to popular culture.As a young researcher in the late 1960s, Ekman changed the scientific consensus on facial expressions. In the postwar era, the conventional wisdom of eminent anthropologists like Margaret Mead was that human facial expressions were learned and that they varied across cultures. Ekman believed otherwise. He showed photographs of people making faces expressing 30 different emotions - including anger, joy and fear - to subjects in the United States, Japan and South America.Across cultures, the study's participants linked the expressions they were shown with the same emotions.He then travelled to Papua New Guinea with a colleague, Wallace V Friesen, and showed the same pictures to some 300 Indigenous people who had no exposure to modern media and could not have learned to interpret faces that way. These subjects also connected the expressions to the same emotions.""There is a pan-cultural element in facial expressions of emotion,"" Ekman wrote in a paper in 1970 on returning to the United States.","Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco.

Why the F-35 stands beyond Russian fifth-gen capability

Inside the satellite-driven combat network that makes the F-35 nearly invisible





NEW DELHI: The ""Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II"" is not just another fighter jet — it is a geopolitical instrument, a technological ecosystem and the most widely exported fifth-generation aircraft ever produced. No other defence platform in the modern era has reshaped alliances, altered regional balances of power, or influenced international diplomacy the way the F-35 has. From Europe to West Asia, from the Indo-Pacific to Nato’s forward edge, the aircraft has become a tool through which Washington strengthens partnerships, discourages adversaries, builds influence and enforces compliance.The F-35 represents more than stealth — it represents networked warfare, real-time intelligence fusion and precision strike capability that allows pilots to “see first, fire first and disappear.” A US analyst once summarised the aircraft in one sentence: The F-35 is what happens when a jet becomes a computer that kills.Its strategic dominance is the reason states compete to buy it — and also why Washington tightly controls who receives it, at what configuration, when upgrades are released, and what internal code becomes accessible. The F-35 is both a fighter and a foreign-policy lever.As the United States tries to rebalance the Middle East through fighter jet diplomacy and trade, a proposed sale of its most advanced combat aircraft, the F-35, to Saudi Arabia has put Israel firmly at the centre of the debate.The potential deal, discussed during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the White House and his talks with US President Donald Trump, envisages Riyadh joining the exclusive club of F-35 operators. But officials and reports say the Saudi jets, if the sale goes through, will be delivered in a less advanced configuration than those flown by Israel, in line with Washington’s long-standing commitment to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region.According to Reuters, US officials have indicated that the F-35s planned for Saudi Arabia will lack some of the superior features installed on Israel’s fleet, including advanced weapons systems and electronic warfare equipment. Israel, which has been operating the F-35 for roughly eight years, enjoys unique permissions to modify its aircraft, integrating its own weapons and adding radar-jamming and other upgrades without seeking fresh US approval. Still, the Israeli Air Force has opposed the proposed Saudi sale, warning in a position paper to political leaders that it could erode Israel’s air superiority in the region, The Times of Israel reported. Defence experts also note that even if Saudi Arabia gets the jets, it is unlikely to receive the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile, the next-generation air-to-air weapon being developed for fifth-generation platforms, as Douglas Birkey of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies has pointed out.A fifth-generation fighter jet is not simply a more modern aircraft — it is a leap in how air warfare is fought, sensed, processed and won. Fourth-generation jets like the F-16, Su-30 or Mirage 2000 are machines of speed, thrust and manoeuvre, designed for visual-range engagements with radar as their primary sensor. Fifth-generation fighters are not built merely to fight — they are built to detect, decide and destroy without ever being seen.In military terms, a fifth-generation fighter is defined by a convergence of technologies rather than a single capability. The first is stealth. These aircraft are engineered to minimise radar cross-section through angled geometry, radar-absorbent composites, internal weapons bays that eliminate external drag signatures, and infrared suppression to reduce heat signature. Unlike earlier fighters, which radiate powerfully when scanning for threats, fifth-generation jets can enter heavily defended airspace without announcing themselves.The second defining feature is sensor fusion. A modern fifth-generation aircraft does not feed a pilot separate streams of radar, infrared, targeting pod and electronic surveillance data. Instead, onboard computers merge all sensor inputs — from the aircraft itself and from external assets such as AWACS, satellites or friendly fighters — into one single tactical picture. Pilots no longer interpret dials; they see the entire battlespace as if viewed from above.The third layer is network-centric warfare. Fifth-generation fighters are not lone hunters. They are nodes in a digital combat mesh, sharing encrypted data silently through low-probability-intercept links. An enemy aircraft detected by one jet can be targeted by another. A missile launched by a ground battery can be guided by the data uplink of an aircraft hundreds of kilometres away. This ability to fight as a distributed swarm rather than as isolated aircraft fundamentally reshapes air power.Advanced avionics and electronic warfare complete the definition. A fifth-generation jet can jam enemy radars, spoof missile seekers, absorb electromagnetic signals for tracking, and identify threats passively without using its own radar. And unlike legacy platforms, which improve only with major hardware refits, fifth-generation jets evolve through software. Each system upgrade can expand detection range, add weapons integration, enhance stealth performance, and reconfigure threat libraries without redesigning the airframe.True fifth-generation capability, therefore, is not just stealth or thrust — it is stealth + fusion + networking + EW dominance + software-driven evolution. Only a few nations have achieved it at scale. The United States leads with the F-22 and F-35, China fields the J-20, and Russia’s Su-57 is still maturing. Others, from Japan and South Korea to India and Europe, are now racing toward sixth-generation development.For United States, selling a fighter jet — especially one as tightly controlled and technologically dense as the F-35 — is never just an arms deal. It is foreign policy with wings. Fighter exports form the backbone of long-term military partnerships, binding nations to American logistics chains, software ecosystems, training infrastructure and, by extension, strategic alignment. Unlike traditional defence sales that end at delivery, fifth-generation platforms create decades-long dependence through updates, maintenance and weapons integration cycles. In practice, a country purchasing an American fighter is not just buying an aircraft — it is entering a relationship.Washington has mastered this form of influence. Nations that operate US platforms rely on American training academies, spare-parts pipelines, engine overhaul depots, weapons testing facilities and encrypted mission-data updates. Every missile added, every software patch authorised, every radar mode unlocked passes through Washington. This system of controlled access means jets double as diplomatic leverage — a partner aligned with US interests receives faster upgrades, deeper integration, and next-generation weapons; one that defies US strategic preferences risks delays, sanctions or removal from programmes entirely.Turkey stands as a pivotal example. Once a full partner in the F-35 programme, it was expelled after purchasing Russia’s S-400 missile system, losing aircraft access, industrial participation and billions in future revenue. The message was clear: ownership is conditional, and alignment is monitored continuously. In West Asia, the dynamic is even sharper. While Israel receives the most advanced F-35 variant with unrestricted modification rights, Saudi Arabia and the UAE face conditional pathways shaped by politics, security guarantees and trust evaluations. The aircraft has become a reward in geopolitical negotiation — allocated not just by purchase capacity, but by reliability as an ally.Washington also uses fighter jet access to shape regional balance. When Russia grows more assertive in Europe, Nato states receive accelerated F-35 deliveries. When China expands its footprint in the Pacific, Japan, South Korea and Australia acquire larger fleets. Where deterrence is needed, jets are not merely sold — they are stationed, forward-deployed and network-integrated. Air power becomes a diplomatic signal: a squadron represents intent; a fleet represents alignment.The possible sale of American F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia has triggered concern within US defence circles, mainly over fears that sensitive technology could slip into the hands of China or Pakistan.A New York Times report, citing a Defense Intelligence Agency brief, outlined concerns that China could eventually access stealth-signature, electronic warfare and radar-absorption modelling if Saudi Arabia imported F-35s into an environment where Chinese contractors provide network infrastructure or defence systems integration. Fifth-generation technology is not just metal and avionics — it is algorithms, mission-data files, sensor-fusion logic, heat-signature shaping and software-defined radar behaviour. Modern aircraft intelligence can be compromised by observing emissions, not stealing hardware.The risk is amplified by how the F-35 works. Its stealth coating chemistry, radar-cross-section shaping and EW system profiles are jealously guarded secrets. Even partial exposure — radar testing from different angles, heat-signature mapping during take-off, or electromagnetic sniffing during exercises — could help adversaries develop counter-stealth solutions. A single compromised maintenance facility, a breached digital-link terminal or a shared runway environment can generate exploitable telemetry.Pakistan emerges as a secondary risk vector. Though Saudi Arabia would not directly transfer Western equipment to Islamabad, support personnel, training officers, or data exposure through joint exercises could indirectly benefit Pakistan’s China-aligned aviation programmes, including development of the J-20 and future stealth derivatives. Washington’s caution reflects precedent: Pakistan received F-16s under strict conditions, and even those platforms faced upgrade restrictions over decade-long concerns of technology diversion to China.This is why, even if Riyadh eventually receives the aircraft, officials quoted by Reuters and defence analysts note the jets would almost certainly be a restricted configuration — without Israel-level electronic warfare autonomy, without independent modification rights, and likely without access to the AIM-260 JATM, the most sensitive next-generation air-combat missile. The architecture would be export-sanitised because leakage is difficult to reverse.US officials say the sale is still under review, and any final agreement will require a detailed security assessment. For now, Washington is weighing two priorities — strengthening ties with Saudi Arabia, and ensuring the F-35’s sensitive technology does not reach rival powers.Fifth-generation fighters remain the rarest and most strategically valuable aircraft in the world — and today, only a handful of nations operate them at scale. At the centre of this landscape is the American F-35, the only fifth-gen platform deployed across multiple continents, services and alliances.The United States leads the field, operating all three variants — Air Force (F-35A), Marine Corps STOVL (F-35B) and Navy carrier-based (F-35C). The jet is now the backbone of Western air power and has been adopted or ordered across Europe, including by the United Kingdom, Italy, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland. In the Indo-Pacific, Japan, South Korea and Australia have emerged as major F-35 operators, a deployment pattern closely aligned with Washington’s broader strategy to deter Chinese expansion.Israel became the first operator in West Asia and remains the only regional user to have deployed the F-35 in real combat missions, benefiting from exceptional access, early delivery and custom integration rights.Outside the US-led ecosystem, fifth-generation efforts are smaller and far more limited. China’s J-20 is the most advanced non-Western platform currently in service, designed primarily for long-range interception and air-superiority missions, with an eye on US surveillance aircraft and refuelling tankers in the Pacific. Beijing is also developing a second stealth jet — the FC-31/J-35 — expected to serve aboard future carrier groups.Russia fields the Su-57, but in small numbers, constrained by sanctions, funding pressures and production inefficiencies. While technologically capable in manoeuvrability and close-combat performance, the fleet remains too small to shift global balance in the near term.A few nations are developing future systems — Japan’s F-X, the UK-Italy-Japan Tempest programme, Europe’s FCAS, and India’s AMCA — yet none have reached operational maturity.As of now, the global fifth-generation landscape is essentially a three-pole arena:Until the next generation arrives, the F-35 remains the benchmark — and the only stealth fighter shaping alliances across the world.One of the least visible but most powerful aspects of the F-35 programme is software control. Modern aircraft are software-defined machines. Their flight characteristics, radar modes, electronic warfare responses, weapons employment envelopes and threat libraries are all governed by lines of code. In previous generations, once an aircraft was exported, the buyer had considerable freedom to alter and integrate systems. The F-16 could be rewired and retrofitted domestically, and several countries built their own versions or added indigenous weapons.The F-35 is different. Core mission software, electronic warfare libraries, and threat-identification files are not transferred outright; they are licensed and regularly updated via US-approved channels. This means that Washington retains decisive influence over how far and how fast an F-35 operator can expand its capabilities. Upgrades can be slowed, withheld or tailored. Certain weapons or radar modes can be restricted. In extreme cases, the flow of support and spare parts can be cut altogether.Turkey’s experience offers a case study. After Ankara took delivery of Russia’s S-400 air defence system, the US government removed Turkey from the F-35 consortium, halted planned deliveries and shifted production work away from Turkish firms. In effect, the programme was used not only as a supply contract but as an instrument of sanction. For potential buyers such as Saudi Arabia or the UAE, the message is clear: access to the F-35 comes with expectations about broader strategic alignment, and divergence carries costs.Even among close partners, Washington carefully calibrates the level of capability it provides through the F-35. This is partly driven by the legal requirement to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge in West Asia, and partly by a broader desire to prevent sensitive technology from falling into hostile hands or being reverse-engineered.In practice, this means that not all F-35 operators receive the same radar modes, electronic warfare options or weapons integration at the same time. Highly sensitive systems such as next-generation air-to-air missiles, advanced stand-off weapons and cutting-edge jamming suites may be offered only to a small subset of trusted allies, or delayed until Washington is confident that the regional balance will not be destabilised.There is also a structural interest in maintaining dependence. If every country had identical capabilities and full control over their F-35 software environment, the leverage that comes from upgrade control would diminish. For the United States, the ability to say “not yet” or “not this particular weapon” is part of how it shapes the behaviour of even close partners. This sometimes generates friction: air forces that see themselves as front-line contributors to coalition operations may resent being held back from the latest configurations. But from Washington’s perspective, the risks of over-sharing are high, particularly in a world where cyber espionage and covert technical cooperation blur the lines of trust.Comparisons between the F-35 and Russia’s Su-57 are often framed in symbolic terms: two rival fifth-generation fighters, representing two competing geopolitical blocs. Yet in practical terms, the two aircraft inhabit different worlds.The F-35 is more numerous by an order of magnitude. Global F-35 deliveries have crossed the four-figure mark and are still rising, with long-term projections of more than 3,000 aircraft over the life of the programme. The Su-57, by contrast, is present only in small numbers, with production hampered by sanctions, industrial constraints and budgetary pressures. This matters because air power, especially in prolonged conflicts, depends not just on the quality of individual aircraft but on the ability to sustain and replace losses.Stealth and networking also separate the two platforms. The Su-57 incorporates stealth features, but open-source assessments suggest that its radar cross-section reduction is inferior to Western designs, particularly from the rear and at certain frequencies. Coating durability, nozzle shaping and panel fit all contribute. The F-35, drawing on decades of US work on the F-117, B-2 and F-22, is widely assessed to have a lower signature and more mature low-observable maintenance regime.More fundamentally, the F-35 is integrated into a wider Western network of satellites, ground stations, AWACS and datalinked assets. The Su-57 operates primarily within Russia’s own air defence and command infrastructure, which does not have the same global reach or the same level of coalition interoperability. In a beyond-visual-range engagement, the ability of a fighter to draw on offboard sensors can be as important as its onboard performance. On that metric, the F-35’s ecosystem gives it a significant advantage.If stealth is the body of the F-35’s advantage, the satellite-networked combat system that surrounds it is the mind. The jet is deeply integrated into secure satellite communication networks that relay encrypted tactical information from across a theatre and beyond. These links allow the F-35 to receive target coordinates and threat data from sources hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away, including space-based sensors, maritime platforms and airborne early warning aircraft.Because it can rely on this stream of external information, the F-35 does not need to use its own radar aggressively to build a picture of the battlespace. Its passive sensors — infrared cameras, electronic support measures and distributed aperture systems — detect emissions from enemy radars, missiles and aircraft. The mission computer fuses these inputs with offboard data, presenting the pilot with a coherent, real-time picture. In a radar-saturated environment such as the Taiwan Strait or Eastern Europe, this allows the F-35 to remain electronically quiet while still operating with full awareness.This networked approach changes how air campaigns are planned. A formation of F-35s can act as forward sensors for other aircraft or missile systems, passing back targeting data without ever exposing themselves. They can launch weapons cued by remote sources or guide munitions fired by other platforms. Rather than thinking of each jet as a discrete combatant, planners increasingly view them as nodes in a mesh network.For countries that buy the F-35, entry into this network is as significant as acquisition of the aircraft itself. For countries that are denied access, the absence is equally stark. That is why the programme has become not simply a procurement issue but a marker of strategic orientation. It defines who is inside the most advanced Western airpower ecosystem — and who remains outside, watching from a different sky.","The F-35 represents networked warfare, real-time intelligence fusion and precision strike capability. No other defence platform in the modern era has reshaped alliances, altered regional balances of power, or influenced international diplomacy the way the F- 35 has. Israel has opposed the proposed Saudi sale, warning that it could erode Israel’s air superiority in the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125624202,imgsize-50984,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

This is the single monthly status beneficiaries watch to know if they will receive that month’s cash disbursement. The primary goal of the Developed Social Security program is to alleviate poverty and guarantee that eligible families and individuals secure a minimum monthly income for basic needs.Follow these exact steps to see your eligibility quickly:If the eligibility page or button does not appear, it usually means your application has not yet been processed, the Ministry says eligibility reviews are completed before the 9th of each Gregorian month.Applicants should wait until that window closes before checking again.HRSD has a fixed disbursement routine: approved beneficiaries generally receive their social security payment on the 1st day of each Gregorian month. For example, the news guidance confirms the December 2025 payment is scheduled for 1 December 2025; rumors of early payouts are false, the Ministry has said. Use the HRSD payments page to confirm the deposit date and transaction details.A clear, fast eligibility check reduces anxiety for applicants and cuts the spread of false claims about early payments or changed dates. Using the official HRSD platform and following the exact steps above ensures beneficiaries know their status accurately and can take corrective action if additional documentation is required.","The Developed Social Security System (Dhaman Al Ijtima'i Al Mutawwar) is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's core financial safety net.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip.

Oxford word of the year: It's ‘rage bait’ — here's what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/oxford-word-of-the-year-its-rage-bait-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/125685234.cms,"



Rage bait has been crowned as the Word of the Year, 2025, by Oxford University Press. The phrase was chosen after a three-times surge was noted in its usage online, signaling ""a deeper shift in how we talk about attention—both how it is given and how it is sought after—engagement, and ethics online. ""The term is defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content”.The term triumphed aura farming and biohack, which were also shortlisted.The term rage bait first appeared on Usenet in 2002, where it referred to a specific kind of driver’s irritated reaction after being flashed by someone trying to overtake them—planting the seed for the idea of intentional provocation.Over time, the term shifted into online slang, used to describe viral posts on social media and to criticise the broader ecosystem of platforms, creators, and trends that shape what gets published and promoted online.It’s now a staple term in global journalism and in the vocabulary of online creators. The strategy works, too: outrage reliably boosts clicks, especially in the realm of performative politics.As social platforms increasingly reward inflammatory posts, the tactic has escalated into what’s known as rage-farming—a more systematic effort to cultivate anger and drive engagement by repeatedly planting rage-bait material, often wrapped in misinformation or conspiracy-fueled narratives.","Rage bait chosen as the Word of the Year, 2025 by Oxford University Press.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

xAI top executive Ayush Jaiswal’s reaction





Elon Musk’s legendary work ethic









Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his extreme work culture and now his AI company xAI is once again back in spotlight after a post by one of its engineers revealed that he had worked for 36 hours straight without any sleep. This revelation made by the techie started an online debate about work-life balance and the pressures of working in a high-growth tech companies. Amid this discussion, Ayush Jaiswal, an Indian-origin executive at xAI shared a meaningful response on the post which shifted the focus from blaming the individuals to addressing systemic challenges.The controversy and the debate around work-life balance started when an xAI engineer shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) where he shared that he had worked by 36 hours continuously without any sleep while pushing through a demanding project. “Last night I left the @xai office after ~36 hours of working with no sleep. Although I was dead, I was also super energized. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team. Happy thanksgiving!,” wrote Parsa.The post shared by Parsa quickly went viral drawing both attention and admiration. Some users praised him for his dedication while others criticised the unhealthy work environment.Ayush Jaiswal, an Indian-origin top executive at xAI who is also known as the co-founder of edtech startup Pesto, shared his response on the viral post on X.In his reply, Jaiswal wrote: “Don’t be angry with the person who worked 36 hours straight. Be angry with the problem that required it.”The statement made by Jaiswal stresses on the fact the the real issue lies not in the individual’s choice to overwork, but in the circumstances and systemic pressures that make such extreme efforts necessary.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his dedicated to work. In a 2014 commencement speech, Musk advised the students to ‘work super hard’. He also said that by putting in 100 hours a week allows him to achieve twice as much as someone working 50. His schedule often blurs the line between personal and professional life. In a BBC interview, Musk described being “swarmed by men” at parties wanting to pitch ideas, making it difficult to relax or trust people.","An xAI engineer shared a post on social media platform X where he shared that he had worked by 36 hours continuously without any sleep while pushing through a demanding project.

iPhone users finally learn why some callers are hidden and others are simply ‘unknown’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-users-finally-learn-why-some-callers-are-hidden-and-others-are-simply-unknown/articleshow/125673408.cms,"Apple Commnunity

Unknown Caller

No Caller ID

The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think

When you see “No Caller ID”

doesn’t want their identity displayed.

When you see “Unknown Caller”

No Caller ID means the caller refused to show the number.

Unknown Caller means the number itself got lost en route.

The way we respond to each

No Caller ID

Unknown Caller





On the surface, both labels feel identical: a call appears, you don’t recognise it, and your instinct is to reject and sigh. But these two phrases don’t mean the same thing, and once you understand the difference, the mystery of these silent numbers suddenly makes more sense.Let’s start with the human reaction. Most of us will simply let these calls ring out. There’s the gut-level suspicion: if someone really had something to say, they’d text, leave a voicemail, or call from a visible number. And people on Reddit Apple Community forums and countless user discussions echo the same sentiment, confusion, curiosity and a small underlying paranoia. One Apple Community user even described being “spooked” when their phone displayed, insisting they knew the same person had called earlier asand couldn’t figure out why the wording changed.That’s where the difference lies.This happens when the caller actively chooses to hide their number. The caller either changes their device settings to block their ID, or manually prefixes the call (such as dialling 141 in the UK or *67 in the US) to conceal it. In other words, the phone knows exactly who’s calling, it just isn’t allowed to show you.This can be used by scam callers, yes, but it also appears when medical professionals, journalists, government departments or private investigators make outbound calls and don’t want a return call coming back through the same number. There is intent behind the concealment, someoneThis tells a very different story. Here, the network isn’t hiding the number, it simply never successfully received it. On “Unknown Caller,” the caller isn’t necessarily trying to hide anything. The system attempted to provide caller ID, but somewhere between sending and receiving, the data fell apart. That can happen with international routing, inter-carrier incompatibilities or telecom glitches that interrupt identification.Think of it this way:This is why you might see an unknown call from your own bank, your mum’s old mobile, or a landline, even though none of them were deliberately masking anything. The uncertainty isn’t intentional; it’s technical.There’s a psychological split too, and you see it in real user behaviour. People treatas something to distrust, almost adversarially. Meanwhile,is unsettling in a different way, it feels like a blank space, a glitch. There’s room for it to be innocent, and room for it to be fraudulent.So the next time your screen lights up with one of those anonymous labels, you’re not staring at two versions of the same thing. You’re looking at two different mechanisms of anonymity, one chosen by the caller, the other imposed by the network.","Unknown Caller means the number itself got lost en route.

"Government tells WhatsApp, Telegram and others to link services to SIM cards: What it means for users",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-tells-whatsapp-telegram-and-others-to-link-services-to-sim-cards-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/125673507.cms,"What it means for multi-device users and travellers







The Union government has issued new directives requiring messaging apps to enforce SIM card verification and automatically log out web-based sessions every six hours. This means that users will be barred from accessing their services if they do not have a physical SIM card originally used to register for the app present in their device. The directive by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will affect major platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others, and are aimed at combating cyber fraud.According to the notice, these communication apps must ensure within 90 days that their services remain “continuously” linked to the SIM card used during registration. They must block access if the SIM is not present in the device – a technical requirement known as SIM binding. Additionally, web-based versions of these apps, such as WhatsApp Web, must log out users periodically, with sessions not exceeding six hours.“It has come to the notice of Central Government that some of the app based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers... allow users to consume their services without availability of the underlying SIM within the device...posing challenge to telecom cyber security as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds,” DoT stated in its notice.The government is invoking powers from the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, 2025, notified in October, which introduced the concept of Telecommunication Identifier User Entity (TIUE) under telecom regulations.WhatsApp has more than 500 million users in India, and the new regulations may hinder daily use. For example, some people use multiple devices, like phone and tablets, or two phones but link them to use one account on both the devices. They may experience disruptions due to the mandate of SIM binding.Further, people who use WhatsApp on their PCs to lessen their screen time on phone and restrict themselves to communication on messaging apps are likely to face disruption during work hours.“Presently, the binding process between a subscriber's app-based communication services and their mobile SIM card occurs only once during the initial installation and verification phase, after which the application continues to function independently on the device even if the SIM card is later removed, replaced or deactivated,” COAI previously stated.","New regulations require messaging apps to enforce SIM card verification. WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Arattai, Snapchat, Sharechat and others will have to comply. They must block access if the SIM is not present in the device – a technical requirement known as SIM binding.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125673486,imgsize-27952,width-400,resizemode-4/messaging-apps.jpg"

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”
