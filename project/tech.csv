To complete the ensemble, she accessorized with a Louis Vuitton Spark Beanie, valued at $550, and carried a Louis Vuitton Trunk Chain Wallet priced at $2,850.Her jewelry choices were equally impressive.

These luxury items made the singer’s overall game-day outfit come to a staggering $35,560.Despite the Chiefs’ nail-biting 32-29 victory, which secured their spot in the Super Bowl, Swift remained calm and supportive throughout the game. Her partner, Travis Kelce, didn’t have a standout performance with just two catches for 19 yards, but the “Karma” singer was quick to cheer on the entire team.After the game, Swift joined her boyfriend’s family on the field to celebrate the Chiefs' big win.

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What is DeepSeek

DeepSeek hit by cyber attack

Nvidia has emphasized that Chinese AI firm DeepSeek’s progress underscores the value of its chips in the Chinese market, adding that future demand for its hardware will likely grow to support DeepSeek’s expanding services. The chip maker released a statement on Monday, January 27 following a sharp 17% drop driven by investor concerns that DeepSeek had matched competitors like OpenAI while using significantly fewer Nvidia chips than US-based firms.""DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant,"" Nvidia said in its statement.“Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling,” said Nvidia.DeepSeek is a large language model developed by Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek. The AI model features a hybrid architecture combining reinforcement learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for advanced performance. The model comes in two versions: DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero. The latter offers unsupervised fine-tuning, enabling even more refined reasoning abilities.Nvidia is currently selling a chip called the H20 that is designed to meet the most recent export control regulations. DeepSeek’s research indicates it utilized around 2,000 of Nvidia’s H800 chips, specifically designed to comply with US export controls introduced in 2022. Experts previously told Reuters that these regulations, aimed at hindering China’s AI progress, would likely have minimal impact.Meanwhile, the Chinese AI startup was forced to restrict new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers. Reason: The company is citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its systems. “Currently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,” the company posted on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.","Chinese AI firm DeepSeek saw a 17% drop in its share price on Monday, January 27.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

How fall detection and SOS make Apple watch a must have for safety

Fall Detection: Fall Detection uses the accelerometer and gyroscope in the watch to detect major falls. In case of a fall, the watch taps the user on the wrist and asks if he is fine. If the user does not respond within a minute, the watch will automatically call emergency services and share the user's location with them. This feature is very helpful for the elderly or for people who have medical conditions that raise the risk of falling.

SOS: Users can quickly access the emergency service with the press and hold feature using the side button of their Apple Watch. This will alert their emergency contact and share their location. SOS works on any type of Apple Watch model.

In this incredible story, however, the hero was not a man nor was it a rescue dog but rather an Apple Watch . Being equipped with its SOS feature, the watch actually sensed the fall and sent an emergency alert that rescued the skier just in the nick of time.What might have been a calamity of an apocalyptic end turned into the most unbelievable story of survival just because of a tiny gadget that was strapped onto their wrist. Curious of how it went? Here is the full storyWhen a skier fell 1,000 feet down a snowy slope, his Apple Watch came into play. When it sensed the hard fall, the Watch's Emergency SOS feature automatically alerted rescuers and sent them the skier's exact GPS location—all without him lifting a finger.Precise coordinates helped rescue him in time before the freezing conditions could mark him as another victim. He has been well treated for his injuries, thanks to the advanced technology of the Watch.For example, with features like Fall Detection and Emergency SOS, Apple Watch can dial for help when it detects an abrupt fall or crash, even if the wearer can't make that call. The feature also lets emergency contacts know so that proper assistance is rendered in time. In this particular case, life-saving tech works perfectly, as sometimes, just a little gadget can make all the difference.Apple Watch comes with two major safety features: Fall Detection and SOS.

Will Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D be joining the WWE roster at Royal Rumble?

Also read:

Britt Baker is a popular AEW wrestler who hasn’t been seen on AEW programming for a while now. Although rumors suggest that she might be joining WWE soon, that doesn’t seem to be the case at this point in time.Apart from being a wrestler Britt Baker is also a dentist, and its believed that she treats wrestling as her side gig. Rumors suggest that she’ll be joining WWE at the Royal Rumble, so is that really happening? Or is it just a random word that’s emerged from the rumor mill?Based on the information available currently, Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D isn’t joining WWE at this point, and definitely not at the Royal Rumble. According to popular belief, Baker doesn’t really have a good reputation backstage at AEW and while her contract hasn’t expired yet, the company isn’t likely to renew it once it’s over.Readers are advised to take this information with a grain of salt because neither the company nor Baker has confirmed their stance on this matter. However, given that many popular wrestlers including Penta have recently joined the WWE roster, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see her joining the Stamford-based promotion once her AEW contract expires.Furthermore, WWE is keen on signing her once her contract is up, but it’s unlikely that she’ll be debuting at any of the PLEs that the company hosts throughout the year. Such instances are reserved for wrestlers who are extremely popular and have a massive fan following. Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D however, isn’t that popular so it’s unlikely that she’ll be given that stage right at the beginning. Instead, she’ll likely be asked to join NXT, just like Shawn Spears or even Ethan Page, or one of the two brands like Penta.So, those who wished to see Britt Baker at WWE Royal Rumble 2025 , will be disappointed to learn that she won’t be seen at the event in Indianapolis, nor will she be seen at the Stamford-based promotion for a while now. It’ll be interesting to see how this entire angle develops as time goes on.","Britt Baker is a popular AEW wrestler who hasn’t been seen on AEW programming for a while now.
