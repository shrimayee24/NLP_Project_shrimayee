Matchmaking Norms: Defying norms: Matrimonial app brings modern matchmaking to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/defying-norms-matrimonial-app-brings-modern-matchmaking-to-pakistan/articleshow/112774328.cms,"Dozens of young singles in Pakistan 's Lahore , gathered this week for an event hosted by Muzz , a UK-based matrimonial app , marking a major departure from the country's traditional norms.This in-person event, the first of its kind in the conservative Islamic nation, aimed to offer an alternative to parent-arranged marriages and challenge the stigma around dating apps.In Pakistan, parents usually arrange marriages for their children, seeking matches within their communities or extended families.The country of 240 million people often see dating apps stigmatised, with gender segregation prevalent both socially and in workplaces.Muzz's app is grounded on Islamic etiquette and restricted to Muslim users. It allows users to blur pictures except for specific matches and offers the option of having chaperones oversee meetings.Since its launch in 2015 in Britain, Muzz has attracted over 1.5 million users in Pakistan, making it the app's second-largest market after Morocco.The Lahore event provided a safe space for attendees like Aimen, 31, to step out of the confines of online interactions. “I used the app for two weeks, but when I saw an ad for this event, I thought, why not meet people in person?” she said.Moaz, 27, who has been using Muzz for a year, expressed hope that the event might help him find a life partner.However, he pointed out that many girls on the app expect parental involvement from the start, which he found challenging. ""That is not possible,"" he said, emphasising the importance of getting to know someone before involving families.In addition to Muzz, other events like Annie's matchmaking party in Lahore are also challenging traditional matchmaking norms .Noor ul Ain Choudhary, the 30-year-old organiser, faced criticism online for allegedly promoting a ""hookup culture."" She defended her event, explaining that it was intended to provide a safe space for singles to meet and connect.","Muzz, a UK-based matrimonial app, hosted an in-person event in Lahore.

Seven suns in sky?

However, what seemed like a cosmic spectacle was actually an optical illusion .The phenomenon was caused by light refracting through the layered glass of the hospital window, producing what are known as ""virtual images."" Each pane of glass contributed to the appearance of a separate sun.Despite the scientific explanation , social media users had fun speculating about the cause of the ""seven suns."" On Weibo, one user joked, ""We’ve finally uncovered the truth about global warming,"" while another humorously suggested a ""magnetic field glitch"" had caused parallel universes to overlap, but reassured viewers that ""the Cosmic Bureau has fixed the issue.""The optical illusion also garnered attention on Reddit, where users drew comparisons to the Chinese myth of Hou Yi, a cosmic archer who shot down nine of Earth’s 10 suns to prevent the planet from burning up. One Redditor quipped, ""When Earth has astigmatism,"" while another humorously questioned if the sight was a ""system apocalypse"" or a consequence of China's well-known air pollution issues.Ultimately, the ""seven suns"" were a reminder of how easily our senses can be deceived by natural phenomena, sparking a mix of awe, humor, and curiosity among those who witnessed or heard about the event.","A woman in Chengdu, China, captured a video showing seven suns in the sky.

The clip, circulating on social media, shows Walz apparently yanking his son’s arm to pull him on stage during the event.The video was captured on Wednesday, the same night Gus was seen tearfully cheering for his father from the audience.While many initially praised the Walz family's heartfelt displays of affection, the newly emerged footage has drawn criticism for what some are interpreting as an overly aggressive gesture.Gus, who has a nonverbal learning disorder and an anxiety disorder, appeared emotional during his father’s speech, mouthing, ""That's my dad!"" as he pointed at Walz on stage. However, the heartwarming scene has now been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the video.Social media erupted with mixed reactions. Some viewers suggested that Walz’s actions may have stemmed from excitement or urgency in the moment. Others, however, saw the gesture as an unsettling glimpse into his personality. Comments on X (formerly Twitter) ranged from those expressing concern about Walz's ""aggressive demeanor"" to those accusing him of using his son as a political prop.One user commented, “Tim showing his true colors, looks very unnecessary. Glad he put it on display for all of America to see,” while another said, “Tim Walz pulling his son's arm on stage is more than just a bad look—it's a sign of weak control and poor judgment.”The backlash comes at a critical time for Walz, who is Kamala Harris' vice-presidential running mate. His speech at the DNC was intended to galvanize support for the Democratic ticket, but the narrative has since shifted to this viral video , raising questions about the optics and the potential impact on his campaign.While some defenders argue that the moment has been blown out of proportion, others believe it has opened a window into Walz's character, potentially affecting his public image as the election approaches.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Microsoft Copilot may be rebranded. A report has claimed that the Windows maker is looking to rename its AI-powered chatbot for its business arm. The new name will reportedly be used across Office apps.Citing sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans, The Verge reports that Microsoft is shifting its primary “Microsoft Copilot” brand to “Microsoft 365 Copilot,” emphasising the paid AI tool suite within Microsoft 365.This change also extends to specific Copilot integrations, like “Copilot in Word” becoming "" Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word.”The Copilots for Sales, Service, and Finance are all moving to the Microsoft 365 branding, which means it may result in “Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales”.The graph and web-grounded chat experience within Microsoft 365 Copilot will be branded as "" Business Chat ."" This rebranding reflects internal shifts as different teams within Microsoft develop various Copilot offerings.While the Microsoft 365 team appears to be taking the lead on the Copilot brand, there's no single engineering owner for Copilot across Microsoft. It remains to be seen how future business-focused Copilots outside Microsoft 365 will be branded.This rebrand primarily affects the business side of Microsoft's AI efforts. Consumer-facing Copilot products, like the web Copilot and mobile apps, are expected to remain unchanged.Earlier this year, Microsoft’s direct competitor also rebranded its AI chatbot from Bard to Gemini. Gemini is also the name of its AI models. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained that it reflects a single approach of building AI.""For us, Gemini is our approach overall in terms of how we are building our most capable and safe Al model and Bard was the most direct way that people could interact with our models so it really made sense to just evolve it to be Gemini because you are talking directly to the underlying Gemini model when you use it,"" Pichai said during an interview with CNBC.""I think it will also be the way by which we will keep advancing our models and users can experience it directly, so we thought the name change made sense,"" he added.Gemini LLM are available in three tiers: Gemini Nano, Gemini Pro and Gemini Advanced.",Microsoft Copilot may be rebranded.

How this malware can be dangerous



“NGate malware app can relay NFC data from a victim’s card through a compromised device to an attacker’s smartphone, which is then able to emulate the card and withdraw money from an ATM.”

“This is a new Android attack scenario, and it is the first time we have seen Android malware with this capability being used in the wild,”

“to clone UID of some NFC cards and tokens to access restricted areas,”

How attackers are spreading this malware



Researchers have discovered a new Android malware which uses the Near Field Communication ( NFC ) reader of an infected smartphone to steal payment card details . According security research firm ESET, the malware collects card data and relays it to attackers who then create effective clones of contactless payment cards that work at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals.The researchers have named the malware "" NGate ,"" which leverages the open-source NFCGate tool to exploit NFC-enabled devices. In a video uploaded on YouTube, security researcher Lukas Stefanko demonstrates how the Android malware works. Watch the video here:In the video, Stefanko explains:he added.The researchers also noted that NGate, or similar apps, could potentially be used in other contexts, such as cloning smart cards used for various purposes. The attack would function by replicating the unique identifier (UID) of the NFC tag.This malware can also be possibly usedStefanko added.In a statement to Ars Technica, Stefanko and another ESET researcher Jakub Osmani explained that attackers are employing a sophisticated phishing scheme targeting bank customers. The attack involves sending SMS messages with links to malicious websites impersonating banks. Once victims install the malicious PWA and enter their credentials, attackers gain access to their accounts.To further deceive victims, attackers pose as bank employees, claiming that their accounts have been compromised due to the phishing attack. They then guide victims to download the NGate malware, which is used to steal sensitive banking information and facilitate unauthorised transactions.Attackers can use NGate to change withdrawal limits and transfer funds to other accounts without leaving traces. This highlights the importance of being vigilant against phishing attempts and protecting personal information.",Researchers have discovered a new Android malware which uses the Near Field Communication ( NFC ) reader of an infected smartphone to steal payment card details.

"Google launches Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it’s first-ever foldable phone in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/google-launches-pixel-9-pro-fold-its-first-ever-foldable-phone-in-india/articleshow/112498936.cms,"Pixel 9 Pro Fold has bigger and brighter displays

Tensor G4, Gemini and more AI inside

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver. The phone supports fast charging at 45W, which should fill up the battery up to 55% in about 30 minutes. FYI, the charger isn’t included in the box. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 . There’s the usual Google promise of 7 years of OS and security updates.Would it even be a Pixel phone, if there’s no AI in it. Well, there’s a whole lot of AI. For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it. There’s a long list of AI features that complements the camera hardware on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The usual Super Res Zoom, Zoom Enhance, Video Boost, Face Unblur, Photo Unblur, Best Take, Magic Eraser, Audio Eraser, and Magic Editor makes their return. Well, Magic Eraser now has an a “reimagine” feature that Google says can give photos a “whole new look.”One new AI tool to come to Google’s Pixel 9 pro Fold is the “Add Me,” which as you’d image can add you to a picture. So, how does it work? Well, you take photo with the group, swap in yourself, and AI will merge the photos.Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is priced in India at Rs 1,72,999 and will be available for purchase later this year. While it comes in two colours – Obsidian and Porcelain – it’ll be available only in Obsidian colour in India.","Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

“Hell, I might just launch at India just for the sake of it!”

How the YouTuber reacted to the troll’s comments



“Saar your mum after I do my shift at Uber screams that at night btw saar, please saar, harder saar, I spit on the b***h and all she says is thaank sou saar. I don't shower saar and women don't talk to me saar. I work at Tim Hortons saar.”

“Believe it or not, I just don't like India. Also I can sense an Indian, he is Indian. If a man online suddenly talks about ducking your mother in the first response, he's Indian. Many such cases.”

A UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians on the social media platform X (earlier known as Twitter). It all started with a meme video that he uploaded on X as a joke. The video showed alleged nuclear missiles coming out of hidden silos in the US and a worldwide nuclear war.While sharing the video he wrote: “When I become prime minister of England, I'll open the nuclear silos as an explicit warning to any foreign power that interferes with British interests and affairs.I'm not talking huge incidents, I'm itching to launch and atomise entire nations over the smallest infraction.”A few minutes later Routledge added a comment to the post as he said:After sharing the post, he also responded to the comments made from a troll account which is now unavailable.“Saar I will see you soon saar,” Routledge said replying to the troll's commentsIn another reply, Routledge wrote:He also started receiving threatening DMs from the troll. Assuming that the trolling account may belong to an Indian, he started replying to the X profile with racist remarks against Indians. He shared a screenshot of DMs shared between him and the troll.“Indian threatens to find me, it backfires lmao,” he wrote captioning the screenshot. The image also included the YouTuber’s location and description of his clothes as he challenged the troll to come find him. Since then, the post has received more than 5 million views.In separate posts, he also shared his entire conversation as well as the profile details of the trolling account (which later became unavailable) on the platform.Here’s the full conversation between Routledge and the troll:Routledge’s remarks against Indians have drawn criticism. When another X user accused him of rage-baiting, he explained why he thought the troll threatening him was an Indian.He wrote:",UK-based YouTuber named Miles Routledge has faced backlash after he made several racist remarks targeting Indians.

Bianca Belair talks about her unique braids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/bianca-belair-talks-about-her-unique-braids/articleshow/112633605.cms,"In just a matter of eight years, Bianca Belair has proven her grit and dedication, rising to the top ranks in WWE . She has multiple wins under her belt that include the SmackDown Women’s Championship, and the Women’s Tag Team Championship where she paired up with Jade Cargill . Additionally, she also competed at the main event of WrestleMania 37. Something that stands out the most about her is her unique look that is complete with her long braids that has become part of her signature look.In a recent chat with Cody Rhodes in his show ‘What Do You Wanna Talk About?’, she shared details about her signature braids and how she believes they have a mind of their own. She revealed, ""What's crazy about that is a lot of people still, still to this day [say], 'They're adding sound effects. Oh, she put something in it to make that noise. Nope.
