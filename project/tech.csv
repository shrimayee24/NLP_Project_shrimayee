Former controversial YouTuber Calvin Lee Vail, popularly known as LeafyIsHere, is under fire again. His recent potential Islamophobic post on X went viral, prompting immediate reactions from the followers. While some shared humor, others seemed to agree with his views on advocating extreme violence. A few followers even referenced his controversial past, welcoming him back into his true self. Known for pushing the boundaries with his provocative commentary, Vail’s latest remarks are hateful and inflammatory. Here is all you need to know about it.The latest controversy began with the shocking two-word post made by LeafyIsHere. The post readingimmediately triggered outrage, with some calling it drastic and asking him to take a breather instead of supporting WW3.Some of Vail’s followers even dismissed his comment with dark humor. A user on the post responded,While another commented,referencing LeafyIsHere’s history of platform bans.Some of his followers even laughed off with comments like,Some followers even seemed to be welcoming the controversial figure back to the online world. A comment showcasing it read, ""Another leafy banger.""With the post getting viral, not all were amused, though. It was clearly visible in one of the responses received by Vail on his post. It read,Just a few hours earlier, Leafy even engaged with the post from Iran Military Watch. The post, with the image of missile launches, read,To it, Vail responded,further amplifying concerns over the YouTuber's willingness to escalate the geopolitical tensions for some shock value. It could even be interpreted as a hateful rhetoric that’s targeting the Jewish state and amplifying the Islamophobic tropes. But the truth? None know but can only interpret, considering his past controversies and remarks.The recent controversy of LeafyIsHere is not an isolated event. He has been an active user on X and in 2023 he made a series of deeply offensive remarks targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Amidst these posts, some stated,andVail, with his comments, even targeted Israel. His posts were inflammatory and included,andamong others. He even mocked some conspiracy theories, posting,All comments and posts made in this respect by LeafyIsHere, were homophobic and anti-Israel. They also establish a pattern of using hate speech to garner attention and provoke reactions. With it, the commentary on Israel done by Vail recently is not new. His history underscores the consistent strategy of inflammatory rhetoric, with current backlash just adding to the long record of controversies, leading to his suspensions from some major platforms like Twitch and YouTube.While many condemned the posts of Vail, others celebrated the unfiltered style of his. A few comments read,andsupporting his style. Some, however, urged restraint, with a user simply commenting,There are also some of his followers who, given Vail’s history of bans and suspension on platforms, are wondering if the latest outburst would lead to another crackdown on the platform. However, his account did get suspended before, with being reinstated many times, and the most recent such happening was in June 2025.With the debates raging over hate speech vs free speech, one thing that remains clear is that LeafyIsHere is not backing down, and neither are the critics. Will his recent posts finally get him banned for good or not by the moderation team of X? Only time will tell.","Former controversial YouTuber Calvin Lee Vail, popularly known as LeafyIsHere, is under fire again.

Sam Altman just dropped a big AI prediction for 2026; experts are skeptical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-just-dropped-a-big-ai-prediction-for-2026-experts-are-skeptical/articleshow/121811592.cms,"Sam Altman AI prediction for 2026

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful."" Others argue that while AI can recombine existing ideas in surprising ways, it lacks the context to understand why a question matters. This limitation keeps it tethered to patterns, not purpose, reducing its role to augmentation rather than true innovation.Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be. In science, novelty alone isn't enough; it must be actionable and verifiable. Until AI bridges that gap, its 'insights' may remain intellectually impressive but practically inert.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that by 2026, AI systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" ""Novel insight"" is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses.

Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-was-brilliant-but-dont-copy-this-one-habit-of-him-warns-pixars-pete-docter/articleshow/121851338.cms,"Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, “This Is Not My Business” - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that’s ‘one habit’ you shouldn’t copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs’ decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs’ legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn’t just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. “He would call — especially the producers — at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Docter revealed. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”This intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. “That’s what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,” he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. “Who wouldn’t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?” Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter’s reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn’t about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn’t just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.",Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million.

In a significant overhaul of Indian railways' ticketing policy, the Ministry of Railways made it clear that from July 1, 2025, only Aadhaar-verified users will be entitled to reserve tickets under the Tatkal system through the IRCTC portal or mobile application. It is a key step towards stricter digital identity authentication to prevent misuse, bring in more transparency, and ensure the facility of emergency ticketing reaches legitimate passengers.In a sequel to this order, the ministry has also directed an extra OTP-based Aadhaar authentication layer from July 15, 2025, in order to further rationalise the process.

HOME: Where I can look ugly and enjoy it.

Today morning when I was driving my Ferrari, the alarm woke me up.

Dear Math, please grow up and solve your problems. I'm tired of answering them for you.

Normal is boring.

I need Google in my brain.

I like to hang out with people that make me forget to look at my phone.

I've found the recipe for happiness. Can someone just send me some money so that I can buy the ingredients?

I love food and sleep. If I give you a bit of food or text you all night, that means something.

Be your own kind of beautiful

Unlike protons I don’t deal with negativity

ME my room music internet connection no study a perfect day

If u can’t do great things then do small and simple things in a great way

Real beauty is to be true to oneself that’s what makes me feel good

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don’t have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Keep calm and let karma finish it

I’m not a player I’m the game

Don’t tell people your dreams show them

Success is the best revenge for anything

I’m not special I’m just a limited edition

Be so good they can’t ignore you

I may be wrong but I doubt it

Turn your wounds into wisdom

Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive

Be a voice not an echo

Keep your heels head and standards high

My life my rules my attitude

Make today so awesome that yesterday gets jealous

Life is short make every hair flip fabulous

Be your own kind of beautiful

The best things in life are free The second best are very expensive

Confidence is not they will like me Confidence is I’ll be fine if they don’t

Collect moments not things

You are enough just as you are

Find yourself and be that

Don’t be a prisoner of your past Become the architect of your future

Choose people who choose you

Be fearless in pursuing what sets your soul on fire

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside

Don’t stop until you’re proud

I am not a product of my circumstances I am a product of my decisions

Stay real stay loyal or stay away from me

Life is too short to be serious all the time So if you cant laugh at yourself call me Ill laugh at you

Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don't have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage.

Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.

Fake it until you make it. Act as if you had all the required confidence until it becomes your reality.

The future belongs to the competent. Get good, get better, be the best.

For every reason it’s not possible, there are hundreds of people who have faced the same circumstances and succeeded.

Be a fountain, not a drain.

Great things never come from comfort zones.

Life is a journey, not a destination.

Life always offers you a second chance. It’s called tomorrow.

Every new day is another chance to change your life.

Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.

Prove yourself to yourself, not to others.

Work for a cause, not applause. Live life to express, not to impress.

When you can’t change the direction of the wind, adjust your sails.

Why fit in if you’re born to stand out?

Don’t take kindness as a sign of weakness.

Minds are like parachutes — they only function when open.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.

Hustle in silence, let your results make the noise.

Every day is a fresh start – make it count.

Dream big. Work hard. Stay focused.

Rise above the storm and you’ll find the sunshine.

The grind never lies.

Your only limit is your mindset.

Make it happen. Shock everyone.

Progress over perfection, always.

Don’t wait for an opportunity. Create it.

Fuel your hustle with passion.

You weren’t born to be average.

Prove them wrong – every single day.

Stay hungry, stay humble.

Keep going – your future self will thank you.

Build a life you don’t need a vacation from.

The best views come after the hardest climbs.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

This year is yours – take the shot.

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I’m drowning in memories and there’s no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It’s hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren’t as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it’s not

I’m not okay but I’ll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It’s hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I’m left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I’m tired of fighting for a love that’s already gone

The scars you can’t see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine

Lost in a world that doesn’t see me

It hurts, but I’ll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect… until we weren’t

Crying isn’t a weakness, it’s a release

The hardest part is acting like it’s okay

Some scars never show, but they’re the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn’t say goodbye

I’m okay… just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Life WhatsApp captions



Life isn’t perfect but it has perfect moments

Just because you’re breathing doesn’t mean you’re living

Life goes on with or without you

Collect moments not things

Life is a one time offer use it well

Don’t count the days make the days count

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine

In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take

Be yourself life’s too short to be anyone else

Life’s beauty lies in small moments

Life is tough but so are you

Fall in love with taking care of yourself

Live the story you want to tell

Don’t survive thrive

Life doesn’t have to be perfect to be beautiful

Let your life be your message

Live less out of habit more out of intent

You only live once but if you do it right once is enough

Life is a journey enjoy the ride

Don’t just exist live

Life is made of moments not milestones

Be the energy you want to attract

Make peace with your past so it doesn’t spoil your present

The best view comes after the hardest climb

Life rewards the brave

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Live life to the fullest

To live is the rarest thing in the world Most people exist that is all

Life is short and its up to you to make it sweet

In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself

Life is too important to be taken seriously

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Life is a onetime offer use it well

Life is a beautiful struggle

Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet

Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all

Life is made of ever so many partings welded together

Life is trying things to see if they work

Mark Cuban faces users backlash, asked to ...

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky , the decentralized social media platform he once championed, for becoming “ruder and more hateful,” according to a report by the New York Post. Cuban, known for his tech ventures and former ownership of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, warned that the platform’s lack of diverse perspectives is driving users back to Elon Musk ’s X, formerly Twitter.Cuban, who joined Bluesky in late 2024 with an optimistic post -— “Hello Less Hateful World” -- now says the platform has devolved into a hostile echo chamber. “The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,” he wrote in a series of posts this week, as quoted by the Post. He noted that the platform’s predominantly left-leaning user base often meets dissenting or nuanced opinions with outrage, stifling meaningful discussion. “Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban added.The Post reports that Cuban, who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election but did not donate to her campaign, shared a Washington Post opinion piece by Megan McArdle, which argued that Bluesky’s left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban endorsed the piece, urging users to use the platform’s moderation tools to block rather than attack those they disagree with. “The moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don’t want to see on here, just block them. Don’t attack them,” he wrote.However, Cuban’s critiques sparked backlash from some Bluesky users , the Post noted. Responses included profane attacks, with one user writing, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t,” and another stating, “F–kin leave then, p—y.” A third user, whose post Cuban reposted, called him a “despicable bastard” and told him to “just Go Away.”The report highlighted Bluesky’s rapid growth, noting that its user base tripled from 10 million to over 30 million between November 2024 and May 2025, according to Pew Research Center. This surge followed Elon Musk’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which prompted many liberal-leaning users to leave X for Bluesky.

Gabriella Zuniga’s explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000—despite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, OnlyFans star Gabriella Zuniga’s decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she’s continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Gabriella Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee—known for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean “Diddy” Combs—Zuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit “an extortion attempt.” In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe’s child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe. Once on the brink of signing a $100 million media deal, the NFL Hall of Famer has since stepped away from First Take and postponed his Nightcap podcast tour with co-host Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.“We’ve decided to postpone the Nightcap tour,” Sharpe stated. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the summer of 2026. It’s going to be even bigger, even better.”Also Read: “Sh*t on their shoes”: Erin Andrews disgusted and blasts ‘trashy’ women for public restroom selfies Despite planning a return to ESPN for the 2025-26 season, Sharpe’s future now hinges on the outcome of this high-stakes legal battle.","Gabriella Zuniga, 21, is offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000.

Addressing the Global Need for Rapid Testing



A Versatile Diagnostic Tool



Simple, Cost-Effective, and Portable



From Concept to Commercialization







A breakthrough in infectious disease testing is set to revolutionize the way healthcare is approached in low-resource and remote settings. A team of scientists at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) has unveiled a paper-based diagnostic tool, the Radially Compartmentalised Paper Chip (RCP-Chip), capable of detecting diseases in under 10 minutes. This innovation is a game-changer for fast, affordable, and portable disease screening without the need for complex lab equipment or trained personnel.The RCP-Chip was conceived during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world was grappling with a shortage of efficient testing methods, particularly in areas with limited resources. ""Our goal was to create something fast, affordable, and easy to use, especially in areas where lab access is limited,"" said Mohammad A. Qasaimeh, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering at NYUAD. Qasaimeh is the senior author of the study that led to the development of the RCP-Chip.The new tool offers a simple and rapid solution for detecting infectious diseases. ""It uses a minimal number of reagents and requires only a small sample to run,"" Qasaimeh added, emphasizing the affordability and efficiency of the device. This paper-based diagnostic chip can be deployed easily in diverse settings, from remote villages to urban areas, and can significantly improve healthcare access.While the RCP-Chip was originally designed to detect COVID-19, its capabilities extend far beyond the novel coronavirus. According to Qasaimeh, the device is easily reconfigurable to diagnose other diseases such as chickenpox, dengue, malaria, and more. ""With minor modifications, it can be adapted to diagnose a wide range of diseases or even test hormones and metabolites,"" Qasaimeh explained. This flexibility positions the RCP-Chip as a multi-purpose diagnostic tool that could be used in various medical fields, from general infectious disease testing to monitoring chronic health conditions.""What makes it truly impactful is its real-world potential,"" said Pavithra Sukumar, a Research Assistant at NYUAD and the co-first author of the study. Sukumar highlighted the tool's capacity to significantly improve outbreak responses, enabling faster isolation, treatment, and control. In situations where time is of the essence, such as in epidemic or pandemic scenarios, the rapid testing offered by the RCP-Chip can help curb the spread of diseases before they become uncontrollable.One of the standout features of the RCP-Chip is its portability. Unlike traditional diagnostic devices that require sophisticated lab setups, the chip can be operated with minimal resources. ""It requires a heating stage at around 60 degrees Celsius, which can be easily achieved with common household devices like a hot plate or an oven,"" Qasaimeh explained. The simplicity of the design allows for easy transport and deployment, ensuring that healthcare workers in areas with limited infrastructure can use it effectively.Moreover, the RCP-Chip uses saliva samples instead of traditional swabs, making it even more convenient and comfortable for patients. ""In a short amount of time, you can deploy it for use in almost any area,"" Qasaimeh said. This feature was a key motivation behind the development of the tool, aiming to reduce the time and cost typically associated with traditional diagnostic methods.The development of the RCP-Chip was not without its challenges. Due to pandemic-related lab access restrictions, the team faced delays during the initial stages of research. ""In the initial phase, we focused on designing the chip and brainstorming the approaches,"" said Qasaimeh. It wasn’t until restrictions were eased that the team was able to conduct in-depth testing of the device. ""After initial curfews, gradually we were allowed access to labs, and that’s when we deepened the research and began testing the device,"" he explained.Despite these challenges, the team successfully filed a patent for the device and launched a startup to commercialize it. Biotech companies have already expressed interest in the innovation. ""We aim to find investors so that we can continue with the development stage of the device,"" Qasaimeh added. The focus now is on bringing the device to market and further developing its translational potential, ensuring that it can be adapted for various purposes in the healthcare sector.With the growing demand for affordable and effective diagnostic tools, the RCP-Chip is poised to play a pivotal role in global healthcare. Its low cost, speed, and versatility make it an ideal solution for resource-limited settings, providing a much-needed alternative to current testing methods.","Radially Compartmentalised Paper Chip (RCP-Chip) can detect diseases in under 10 minutes.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.
