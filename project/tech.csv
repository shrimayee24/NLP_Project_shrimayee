BENGALURU: A miscreant broke into the locked home of a college professor in Nagarabhavi 2nd Stage and escaped with gold, diamond jewellery, and cash worth over Rs 30 lakh. In a bid to cover his tracks, he turned on a kitchen tap before fleeing, flooding the house in a bid to destroy his footprints and mislead the sniffer dogs.The victim, Chandana (name changed), had left her home on July 20 to stay at her parents' house in Mallathahalli while her husband was abroad. She ensured multiple safety measures were in place — she had secured the house with metal grills over doors, installed CCTV cameras, and even suspended daily deliveries like milk and newspapers — to ensure the house does not attract the attention of thieves.She also asked her domestic helper of four years to visit the house every morning to water the plants and clean the front yard. The helper, however, did not have access to the locked house, police said.On Saturday morning, the helper noticed the front door ajar and immediately alerted Chandana. Inside, the hall and kitchen were flooded with water, with a tap left running in an apparent attempt by the burglar to erase any evidence.Following the alert, Chandana rushed back to discover the iron grill gate had been forcefully broken, followed by the main wooden door.The bedroom upstairs was ransacked, with almirahs and cupboards broken open and valuables missing.The stolen items included necklaces, bangles, chains, earrings, rings, pendants, gold coins, and Rs 18,000 in cash. According to a police officer, the break-in appeared to be the work of a single individual who spent nearly two hours inside the house before fleeing.Annapoorneshwarinagar police, along with the Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) team, have intensified investigation.","A miscreant broke into the locked home of a college professor in Nagarabhavi 2nd Stage and escaped with gold, diamond jewellery, and cash worth over Rs 30 lakh.

Apple is expected to announce its iPhone 17 series in the first week of September. As the launch gets closer, rumours and leaks about the 2025 iPhone lineup have increased. In a latest, a user has been caught using – what appears to be Apple iPhone 17 Pro – in the wild. Images of the alleged smartphone have been shared by an X user named Fox Puppy. While the authenticity of the images remain unverified, the user claims that the “guy on the right was security and trying to go in front of the iPhone to hide it”.Clearly, the alleged iPhone 17 Pro in the leaked photos can be seen covered in a thick black case. Silver camera rings are visible on the left, and the LiDAR sensor and flash appear to be moved to the right. These placements match earlier mockups and leaks shared in recent months.The X post was quoted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, saying “Wow. This looks legit”.Tipster Majin Bu, in a blog post, has claimed that Apple may reposition the Apple logo which is currently placed slightly off-center and below the camera module since the iPhone X. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, the logo may now be moved lower, toward the center bottom of the phone. “This recent discovery, reported by direct sources among case manufacturers, marks an evolution in Apple’s aesthetic language,” Bu writes.The report adds that the repositioning of Apple logo has raised concerns among manufacturers about possible interference, leading the industry to look for ways to ensure continued compatibility. Some factories have already produced cases based on the current design and are waiting for official confirmation before making changes. To address the issue, case makers are working on design changes.A report by The Information previously said that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with a redesigned rear panel composed of both aluminum and glass. It may feature an aluminum rear panel, housing a camera bump, bigger than the one found on the iPhone 16 Pro models.The report further added that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with an aluminium frame, replacing the titanium frame like their predecessors.On the specifications part, the phone may come powered by Apple’s A19 Pro chip , manufactured using TSMC’s 3nm process. iPhone 17 Pro is said to offer 12GB of RAM, up from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 8GB. For camera duties, it may have a 48MP telephoto lens, replacing the 12MP sensor found in the iPhone 16 Pro. For selfies, the smartphone is tipped to have a 24MP sensor.",A user has been caught using – what appears to be Apple iPhone 17 Pro – in the wild.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing.

Safety First: The Need for Careful Patient Monitoring



Advancing Healthcare with Biotechnology in Saudi Arabia



About the SFDA







The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) announced today the official approval of Leqembi, the first Alzheimer’s treatment available in Saudi Arabia. This approval marks a significant milestone in addressing Alzheimer’s, a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills. Leqembi is specifically indicated for patients experiencing mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia caused by Alzheimer’s, who have either no copies or just one copy of a particular gene variant known as apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4).Leqembi represents an innovative approach to treating Alzheimer’s. Unlike many existing therapies that only ease symptoms, this drug aims to slow the actual progression of the disease. It is a biologic therapy developed using monoclonal antibody technology, a sophisticated method that creates lab-produced molecules designed to target specific proteins in the body.In this case, Leqembi works by targeting beta-amyloid proteins, which build up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients and form sticky clumps known as amyloid plaques. These abnormal protein fragments are widely believed to interfere with communication between brain cells, contributing to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.These plaques interfere with the normal communication between nerve cells (neurons), disrupting brain function. By helping reduce the formation of these harmful plaques, Leqembi seeks to protect brain function and slow cognitive decline over time.The treatment is given through an intravenous infusion every two weeks, allowing the drug to circulate and act within the brain.As per the report, before approving Leqembi, the SFDA thoroughly reviewed evidence of its safety, effectiveness, quality, and compliance with regulatory standards. Clinical trials revealed that Leqembi significantly slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease compared to a placebo. The effectiveness was measured using established clinical scales that assess memory, thinking, and daily functioning abilities.However, like all medications, Leqembi can cause side effects. The most commonly reported include:Because ARIA can only be detected through brain scans, careful monitoring is essential throughout treatment.The SFDA stresses the importance of ongoing patient monitoring during treatment. Before starting Leqembi, patients must be tested for their ApoE4 gene status, as this influences the risk of side effects. Those with two copies of the ApoE4 gene are not currently eligible for the treatment due to a higher likelihood of complications.Additionally, the pharmaceutical company responsible for Leqembi is required to track how the drug performs once it is in use (post-marketing surveillance). They must regularly submit updated reports on safety and effectiveness to the SFDA. A comprehensive risk management plan is also mandatory to ensure the treatment is used safely and responsibly.The approval of Leqembi reflects the SFDA’s commitment to expanding access to advanced and high-quality medical treatments, especially those developed through cutting-edge biotechnological methods. Biotech therapies like Leqembi represent a rapidly growing field in medicine, offering new hope for diseases that previously had limited treatment options.Established in 2003 under the Council of Ministers’ resolution, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority is an independent regulatory body directly reporting to the President of the Council of Ministers. Its main mission is to safeguard public health by ensuring the safety and quality of food, medicines, biological and chemical substances, medical devices, and cosmetics. The SFDA oversees all procedures related to these products, aiming to protect both human and animal health throughout the Kingdom.","Leqembi targets beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, aiming to slow Alzheimer’s progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Bringing Structure and Modern Relevance to Mosque Lessons

A Qualitative Leap Guided by Core Values



Serving the Whole Community with Three Main Tracks



About IACAD







The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD) has introduced a fresh initiative called “Development of Mosque Lessons and Unification of Preaching Content” as part of its IACAD-X projects. This program is designed to improve the quality and consistency of religious lessons in mosques across Dubai, making them more relevant and engaging for today’s diverse community.The main goal of this project is to enhance mosque lessons by standardizing their content within a modern preaching framework. This framework strikes a balance between maintaining religious authenticity and being adaptable enough to address the realities of contemporary society. It recognizes the important role mosques play in educating the community and aims to strengthen this role by providing structured, easy-to-understand religious messages.The curriculum is carefully organized around essential topics and core concepts that resonate with people’s everyday lives. The content is also tailored for different age groups, with special attention given to children and youth. These lessons are delivered using interactive storytelling methods, making them more engaging.Notably, each lesson is designed to be concise and impactful, lasting no longer than five minutes to keep attention and maximize understanding.Jasem Mohammed Al Khazraji, the project lead, explained that this initiative marks a significant improvement in how religious lessons are delivered. “This initiative represents a qualitative leap in the methodology of delivering religious lessons,” he said. The program is built around six core values that are explored over two-month cycles. Each year, these values are refreshed through narratives drawn from the stories of the prophets, the biography of the Prophet Muhammad, and relevant Quranic verses.What sets this project apart is its heartfelt and relatable language, designed specifically for the new generation. Instead of a one-way lecture, lessons encourage live engagement with audiences, making the learning experience more interactive and meaningful.The project comprises three main educational tracks intended to meet the needs of all mosque visitors. Alongside these, there is a special recurring segment called “Children and Families of the Neighbourhood.” This segment aims to strengthen the bond between families and the mosque, positioning the mosque as a central place for fostering positive values and upbringing within the community.Overall, this initiative is a forward-looking step in reshaping religious education in Dubai’s mosques, ensuring that lessons are not only rooted in tradition but also resonate deeply with people’s daily experiences and modern realities.The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) in Dubai, established by Law No. (2) of 2011, oversees Islamic affairs and charitable work in the emirate. It promotes Islamic knowledge, supervises religious content, and licenses charitable organizations, mosques, and Islamic institutions. IACAD also manages Hajj and Umrah affairs, organizes religious events, and raises awareness about Zakat and charity. Originating from the 1969 Department of Endowments, IACAD’s role expanded through laws in 1994 and 2011 to cover charitable, Islamic, and mosque-related activities.","The Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD) has introduced a fresh initiative called “Development of Mosque Lessons and Unification of Preaching Content” This program is designed to improve the quality and consistency of religious lessons in mosques across Dubai, making them more relevant and engaging.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122978235,imgsize-103,width-400,resizemode-4/122978235.jpg"

With the new Umrah season starting in 2025, Saudi authorities are making clear that the focus is not just on numbers, but on the people behind them. The aim this year is simple: make the pilgrimage safer, easier, and more spiritually fulfilling. While millions are expected to visit the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, the Kingdom is working to remove the usual stress points, whether it’s confusion at busy mosques, difficulty for elderly visitors, or problems with hotel bookings.Instead of big slogans or ambitious promises, this year’s changes are grounded in real action. From helpful digital tools to safety gear for vulnerable groups, Saudi Arabia is pushing practical solutions. And with tighter inspections on tourist services, there's also a clear message: quality and safety matter more than ever.These new moves show how the Kingdom is managing modern challenges without losing sight of the spiritual heart of Umrah.One of the main upgrades this year is digital, and very hands-on. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has rolled out a campaign in Madinah to promote the ""Rushd"" app, designed specifically for pilgrims.What the app offers:The campaign is being run at key visitor areas around the Prophet’s Mosque, including historic locations. It’s not just about downloading an app, it’s about helping people use it in a meaningful way while they’re on their journey.To support vulnerable pilgrims, like children, the elderly, and visually impaired visitors, the General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque has launched smart safety bracelets.Here’s what they do:This isn’t about surveillance. It’s about safety, especially in a setting where it's easy to get separated or overwhelmed.A lot of what makes or breaks a pilgrim’s experience is behind the scenes: how smooth the transport is, how well the crowd is managed, or how clean and accessible public areas are. To that end, 16 new initiatives have been rolled out in Madinah under the Pilgrim Experience Program.What’s being improved:In total, 89 different projects across 23 government agencies are currently active, covering everything from security and tourism to health and logistics. According to officials, 95% of these projects are already completed or in final stages.Pilgrims shouldn’t have to worry about where they’re staying, especially in a city as sacred as Makkah. That’s why the Ministry of Tourism has stepped up inspections and closed 25 non-compliant facilities just this July.The reasons included:This crackdown is part of the wider ""Our Guests Come First"" campaign, which also encourages pilgrims to report issues through the Unified Tourism Center (dial 930).It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in a huge place like the Prophet’s Mosque, especially if you're a first-timer or don’t speak Arabic. That’s why two service centers within the mosque courtyards have played a key role in helping pilgrims feel supported.In 2024 alone, these centers:These centers focus on what matters most, comfort, clarity, and calm during worship.Rushd is a free mobile app launched by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. It includes tools like Quran access, prayer times, and a 3D guide for Umrah and Hajj. It's available on most app stores and promoted at major sites in Madinah.No. They are offered mainly to children, elderly pilgrims, and those with disabilities. You can request one through mosque authorities or service centers.Contact the Unified Tourism Center by calling 930. The Ministry of Tourism encourages feedback and will follow up on any complaints related to safety or service quality.","Saudi Arabia has launched new digital and safety tools to improve the Umrah experience in 2025.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

US senator’s letter suggests Apple may not be the only tech company fighting UK’s ‘backdoor’ entry request,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senators-letter-suggests-apple-may-not-be-the-only-tech-company-fighting-uks-backdoor-entry-request/articleshow/122981463.cms,"Google may have faced Apple-like pressure from UK: Wyden



Senator Ron Wyden has formally requested Tulsi Gabbard , Director of National Intelligence, to initiate an investigation into the UK’s alleged digital spying practices, raising alarms that British surveillance laws may be compromising the private data of millions of Americans. In a letter, Wyden suggested that Google, alongside Apple , may have been secretly pressured to allow ‘backdoor’ access to user data. The senator's concern stems from Google's refusal to clarify if it has received such a demand, stating only that it would be prohibited from disclosing such a request if one existed.Citing the letter, The Washington Post said Google told the Senator's office it could not confirm or deny whether the British government had demanded “backdoor” access to private user data on its services. This raises serious questions about whether Google, like Apple, has faced such secret demands.Apple has resisted the attempts to access encrypted user data , with reports surfacing earlier this year that the UK Home Office had secretly ordered Apple to create a backdoor for encrypted messages. In response, Apple disabled its most secure data storage option for UK users, while maintaining it globally.Wyden had previously written to Gabbard, urging her to demand the UK retract its order. Gabbard had concurred, calling such a backdoor demand “a clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties.” Apple is currently challenging the order in a British surveillance court.Wyden’s latest letter suggests that the privacy implications extend far beyond Apple users. While Meta, offering encrypted messaging via WhatsApp and Instagram, told Wyden's office in March it had received no such backdoor requests from the UK, Google's non-committal response is deeply troubling, he said.“When my office asked Google about backdoor demands from the UK, the company did not answer the question, only stating that if it had received [such a demand], it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact,” Wyden wrote, noting this was the same response Apple had previously given.","Senator Ron Wyden has formally requested Tulsi Gabbard to initiate an investigation into the UK’s alleged digital spying practices.

The Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against several unnamed online sellers, accusing them of selling fake Trump merchandise on major retail websites like Amazon , Walmart , and eBay , reports CNBC. According to the report, the lawsuit was filed on July 25 in the U.S. District Court in Florida. The company claims the merchants are selling knockoffs of Trump-branded items without permission. “By selling counterfeit products that purport to be genuine and authorized products using the TRUMP trademarks, defendants cause confusion and deception in the marketplace,” the complaint states.The Trump Organization claims the fake products include coffee mugs, hats, t-shirts, and sweatshirts with “Trump,” “Trump 2028,” and American flag designs. It alleges these are “inferior imitations” of its original products, and that the sellers are not licensed or authorized to use Trump’s name or trademarks.Notably, the Trump Organization sells its own official merchandise on its website, including items like a gold T1 smartphone.In the lawsuit, the company has asked the court to stop the sellers from using the Trump name and trademarks. It also wants Amazon and other platforms to destroy the counterfeit items and shut down the sellers’ accounts.The complaint also says the company plans to ask the court to keep the list of the sellers’ names sealed, meaning they won’t be made public.As per the CNBC report, online sellers have tried to cash in on Trump’s political comeback. In January, sales of Trump-themed products — including calendars, toilet paper and greeting cards — spiked, according to data from marketing company Omnisend and seller software provider JungleScout.Omnisend reported that Amazon sellers earned $140 million in 2024 from Trump-related merchandise ahead of the election.

I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Microsoft's Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter's new startup, Phia.

"Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he stopped playing chess as a kid, but agrees it has become ‘more popular and bigger’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-he-stopped-playing-chess-as-a-kid-but-agrees-it-has-become-more-popular-and-bigger/articleshow/122981170.cms,"iQOO Z10R 5G goes on Sale: BEST Budget Phone for Content Creators?

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently said that he mostly stopped playing chess as a child after realizing that computers would one day easily defeat human players. The tech billionaire was responding to an X (formerly Twitter) post by American businessman Marc Andreessen who wrote: “Chess is more popular and a bigger industry now than ever.” Andreessen's post highlights chess's resurgence, contradicting fears of AI-driven obsolescence, with global participation hitting 605 million players in 2022 per FIDE’s data, a 30% rise since 2012, fueled by online platforms like Chess.com during the COVID-19 pandemic.To this, Elon Musk replied “True, to my surprise. I mostly stopped playing chess as a kid when I realized that it would be trivial in the future to write a chess (low DoF game) program that could beat all humans.”In this context, “low DoF” refers to “low degrees of freedom,” meaning the game has a limited set of possible moves and outcomes, making it easier for a computer to master through programming.In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue made history by defeating world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, becoming the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion under standard tournament conditions.Since then, chess engines have only become more powerful. Modern AI systems like Stockfish and Google’s AlphaZero can calculate millions of positions per second, easily outperforming even the strongest human players. AlphaZero, developed by DeepMind (a Google-owned company), learned the game from scratch using reinforcement learning and went on to beat top engines using unconventional and creative strategies — a milestone in AI development.Despite AI dominance in the game, chess has seen a global resurgence thanks to online platforms, live-streamed tournaments, and popular culture moments like Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit. Musk acknowledged this rise in popularity but maintained that the game’s eventual solvability by machines made it less appealing to him.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently said that he mostly stopped playing chess as a child after realizing that computers would one day easily defeat human players.

"Viral women’s dating app hacking: Private messages related to abortion, cheating on Tea exposed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/viral-womens-dating-app-hacking-private-messages-related-to-abortion-cheating-on-tea-exposed/articleshow/122980712.cms,"What is the app all about and who hacked it



Tea , the viral women's dating safety app, has indicated that the recent cyberattack, which initially saw approximately 72,000 images accessed, is more extensive than previously reported. As a precautionary measure, the app has disabled its direct messaging (DM) feature following another report which claims that the critical flaw allowed unauthorised access to highly sensitive user communications, including discussions about abortions, cheating partners and even shared phone numbers.In response to the latest revelations, Tea announced via its Instagram account, “The Tea Party Girls,” that it had taken “the affected system offline” out of “an abundance of caution,” acknowledging that “some direct messages (DMs) were accessed as part of the initial incident.”According to a report from 404 Media, the leaked direct messages are incredibly sensitive. Examples cited by the publication include a user discovering their husband being discussed on the app, a woman contacting others about her fiance, and numerous conversations about abortions.The chats also frequently contained damning accusations against individuals, and the publication says that it found it “very easy” to determine the real identities of many participants or those being discussed.Tea’s core premise is to provide an anonymous space for women to exchange information about men for safety purposes, verifying users' identities through selfies upon account creation. The app gained popularity and quickly became one of the top apps on the App Store in the US.However, the app has been plagued by security issues since its rise to popularity. A previous report by the same publication claimed that members of the 4chan forum had found an exposed Tea database containing user selfies and driver’s licenses, which were then posted online.A Tea spokesperson told 404 Media on Tuesday that the company's team remains “fully engaged in strengthening the Tea App’s security” and that they are “working to identify any users whose personal information was involved” to offer them free identity protection services.","Tea, the women's dating safety app, has indicated that the recent cyberattack is more extensive than previously reported.
