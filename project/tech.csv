A sophisticated bar experience inspired by European charm

More than a bar — it’s a curated lifestyle destination





One of Edmonton’s most buzzworthy new venues is set to open its doors next week, and the anticipation is building. Lauren Kyle McDavid — the wife of NHL superstar Connor McDavid — is launching Bar Trove, an elegant new bar located in the historic Canada Permanent Building in downtown Edmonton. With an opening date set for June 6, this upscale addition to the city’s hospitality scene is already turning heads with its stylish concept and refined ambiance.Bar Trove isn’t your average night-out spot. The vision behind it draws deeply from the timeless sophistication of Parisian and London lounges. Visitors can expect an atmosphere where historical charm meets modern luxury — a rare blend in the city’s bar landscape. The design features include wood-panelled walls, plush furniture, and artfully selected fixtures, each contributing to the warm, intimate vibe of the space.This attention to detail isn’t surprising, considering Lauren Kyle McDavid is a well-known interior designer with her own firm. She has also co-founded Trove Living, a curated furniture showroom that launched alongside the bar.What sets Bar Trove apart is its fusion of design, hospitality, and social experience. It’s not just about sipping cocktails — it’s about being immersed in a thoughtfully crafted environment. Kyle McDavid explained the concept clearly in a statement shared with Dished earlier this year:“Bar Trove felt like a natural extension of Trove Living – giving people a place to gather, experience beautiful design, and enjoy incredible food and drinks in a curated setting.”The space offers a social haven for those who appreciate both aesthetics and atmosphere — something that has been missing from Edmonton’s bar scene.While the full menu remains under wraps for now, early hints suggest that Bar Trove will feature premium cocktails, a selection of fine wines and spirits, and elevated shareable dishes like oysters and caviar. The focus appears to be on quality and sophistication, promising an upscale yet approachable experience for discerning locals and visitors alike.Also Read: Patrik Laine’s fiancée Jordan Leigh throws shade at Justin Bieber as Hailey Secures billion-dollar deal without his help With its grand opening just days away, Bar Trove is poised to become one of the most sought-after destinations in Edmonton — not just for what’s in your glass, but for the design-driven atmosphere that surrounds it.",Lauren Kyle McDavid is launching Bar Trove in Edmonton's historic Canada Permanent Building on June 6.

Whether it’s identifying clever wordplay or spotting thematic patterns, today’s puzzle offers a fun mix of categories ranging from straightforward to subtly tricky. Below you’ll find a full breakdown of today’s hints and answers. We’ll walk you through each stage — just scroll carefully if you don’t want early spoilers!Connections is a daily word puzzle game from The New York Times where players group a list of 16 seemingly unrelated words into four distinct categories. Each group of four words is connected by a theme or shared trait, and there's only one correct way to sort them. The challenge lies in not only spotting the obvious links but also in recognising more abstract or playful associations.To play, head to the NYT Games website or mobile app, where the daily puzzle appears at midnight local time. You'll see 16 words and your goal is to sort them into four categories of four words each. Select four words that you believe are related and hit “Submit.” If correct, the group is locked in. If not, you lose one of your four lives. Hints sometimes appear to let you know if you're close, but be careful — use up all your lives and it’s game over. The groups vary in difficulty, with colour-coded labels: yellow (easiest), green, blue, and purple (most difficult).Here are today’s clues for the four groups — read them slowly to avoid spoilers:And here are today’s group categories (no word spoilers just yet):Yellow group – SaluteGreen group – SuitableBlue group – Verbs for finishing donutsPurple group – What “buff” might meanYellow (Salute): APPLAUD, HAIL, HONOR, PRAISEGreen (Suitable): APT, FIT, PROPER, RIGHTBlue (Verbs for finishing donuts): FROST, GLAZE, POWDER, SPRINKLEPurple (What “buff” might mean): ENTHUSIAST, MUSCULAR, NUDE, POLISHThis was a well-balanced puzzle with a mix of literal and lateral thinking. The green group was likely the easiest, with “APT” and “RIGHT” pointing directly toward the idea of suitability. The blue group was delightfully playful — all verbs related to how you might finish a donut, literally. The yellow group, themed around expressions of approval or tribute, was direct once you recognised the shared gesture. The purple group had the trickiest twist: ""buff"" as in someone who’s muscular, a film buff (enthusiast), being in the buff (nude), or giving something polish — all valid uses of a single word.Today’s Connections puzzle offered a nice blend of language fun and logical reasoning. If you cracked it without losing a life — congrats! If not, don’t be discouraged. Part of the fun is stretching your brain and discovering clever links.

Former Indian-origin Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal , alongside colleague Hossam Nasr , disrupted a presentation by Microsoft's head of AI security Neta Haiby at the Build 2025 conference on Tuesday, causing an unexpected revelation of confidential internal messages about Walmart's artificial intelligence expansion plans.The leak occurred when Haiby switched screens amid the protests, accidentally exposing private Teams conversations about the retail giant's upcoming use of Microsoft's AI tools.

The conversation also quoted a Walmart AI engineer praising Microsoft's security capabilities, stating ""Microsoft is WAY ahead of Google with AI security.

A video has gone viral in which a full-grown rhino is seen crashing a wedding in Nepal. His playful loitering left the attendees both startled and stunned, as his wedding walkin took the internet by storm.For many, weddings are often one of the most memorable days in their lives, they usually stand out for their stunning decorations, emotional vows, or show-stopping dances. But at this celebration, it certainly wasn't the couple who grabbed attention, rather the majestic rhino.Though the video has taken the internet by storm, the exact time and place of the incident are still unclear. Originally posted by the Instagram handle ‘nepalinlast24hr’, the clip has quickly gone viral, drawing thousands of views and buzzing reactions.As expected, social media didn’t miss a beat. Users pounced on the bizarre moment with peak meme energy. One called it a “wild card entry,” another dubbed it “the ultimate grand entrance,” and a third nailed it with: “When the invite says ‘everyone’s welcome’ and mother nature RSVPs personally.”Adding to the laughs, one user joked, “He clearly came to bless the newlyweds,” while another quipped, “Forget baraatis, this was a full barah-ton entry!” Some couldn’t resist speculating on the wild guest list, with one commenting, “When you book a venue next to the jungle, don’t be surprised if the jungle shows up.”The punchlines just kept rolling in. “Maybe he was hunting for the dance floor,” one user joked. Another declared, “the real VIP just rolled in!” Someone wondered, “hope they had a return gift ready for the big guy,” while another laughed, “guess the rhino missed the dress code memo.”","A full-grown rhino is seen crashing a wedding in Nepal.

In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China. The competition, part of the China Media Group (CMG) World Robot Competition – Mecha Fighting Series, was held on May 25 and marked the debut of robotic fighters in a full-fledged combat sport.The robots were developed by Unitree Robotics, a Chinese tech company known for its advanced humanoid machines. Four Unitree G1 robots took part in the fight, each about 132 centimeters tall and weighing 35 kilograms, reported Asia Times.They were remotely controlled by human trainers using joysticks, and the match was broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV).While the event sparked excitement among viewers, one social media user commented humorously, “The part that confuses me most is the referee in the ring.”Videos from the match showed the robots exchanging punches and kicks with surprising coordination. Although the strikes were more like soft pushes than real hits, the movements displayed impressive balance and speed for machines.The match was part of a larger effort to test and showcase the growing abilities of AI and robotics in dynamic settings.Earlier this year, a Unitree robot was seen in a viral video aggressively reacting to its handlers during a demo, raising safety concerns.In another case, during February’s Spring Festival Gala in Tianjin, a robot reportedly charged toward a crowd, alarming attendees.Such incidents, including a recent case at Tesla's factory in Texas where a robot allegedly injured a worker, have sparked growing concern over AI safety and the potential risks of advanced robotics. Experts have pointed to software glitches and inadequate testing as common causes, highlighting the need for strict quality control in AI development."," humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

NYT Connections is back again with an exciting word puzzle. Looking for help to solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle? Whether you're stuck, curious about the logic behind the groupings or trying to preserve your win streak, you’re in the right place. Each day brings a fresh challenge that mixes wordplay, general knowledge and clever associations. Below, we explain what Connections is, how to play, and we provide the hints, categories, and full answers for today’s game — Friday, 23 May 2025. Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life. Lose four lives, and it’s game over.Use these hints to help form the correct groups:(Think of events that involve dancing, music, or big gatherings.)(Consider words that relate to someone's personality, essence or internal makeup.)(You might hear these on a scale or in a recipe — pre-metric system units.)(A beauty product, a type of marble, a celestial object and a type of eyewear style.)BASHBLASTBLOWOUTRAVEThese are all terms used to describe large, energetic parties or celebrations.CHARACTERFIBERMAKEUPNATUREEach of these words can refer to the fundamental qualities or essence of a person or thing.DRAMOUNCEPOUNDSTONEAll are units of weight commonly used in the imperial measurement system, particularly in the UK.EYELINER (a type of makeup styled as a cat-eye)GLASSES (as in lenses shaped or styled like a cat’s eye)MARBLE (cat’s eye marbles are a specific type of toy marble)NEBULA (as in the Cat’s Eye Nebula, a famous astronomical object)If you were thrown off by the group involving MAKEUP, EYELINER and BLOWOUT, you’re not alone—it was easy to assume a beauty-related category.

The purple category was the most obscure, tying together vastly different meanings of “cat’s eye” across science, fashion, cosmetics and childhood games.That’s everything for today’s puzzle.

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2025, which is set to be held between June 9 and June 13, is expected to feature major announcements across its software and platforms. While primarily for developers, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s annual event typically offers enough previews to interest a broader audience. This year's conference is expected to introduce an entirely new look for much of Apple's software, aiming for a more unified experience across iPhones, tablets, and computers. Apple Intelligence, which was the focus of last year's WWDC, is expected to return in 2025 as Apple seeks to build momentum for its AI tools. The appearance of new hardware is also a possibility, though considered less likely this time.The event, which will be livestreamed on YouTube, is set to kick off with a keynote on June 9, starting at 1 PM ET (10.30 PM IST). This keynote will set the stage for the software updates Apple plans to release later this year. Here are the top 5 announcements that the company is expected to make at WWDC 2025:Apple’s WWDC 2025 is expected to focus on a broad interface refresh across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, rather than solely on new features. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the redesign, codenamed “Solarium”, will borrow visionOS elements like rounded icons and translucent menus to create a unified look.This will update app layouts, window styling, system buttons, and overall visual language. The last major iPhone interface change came with iOS 7’s shift away from skeuomorphic design. Solarium aims to modernise Apple’s software appearance, though users may need time to adjust to the new design when it debuts at WWDC.As per Gurman, Apple may also replace traditional version numbers for its software with the upcoming year. Beginning at WWDC 2025, iOS 19, macOS 19, and watchOS 19 would become iOS 2026, macOS 2026, and watchOS 2026, and so on.This change likely aims to standardise naming across platforms, making it easier to reference releases by year rather than by disparate version counts.The upcoming iOS 26 is expected to focus more on the interface redesign yet reports indicate several new features for Apple’s phones. One report by Tom’s Guide suggests iOS 26 will include a simplified Wi-Fi sign-on, allowing login credentials to be shared across Apple devices.Another feature, powered by AI, is expected to optimise battery life and predict charging times. While these additions may be modest, they could enhance the user experience.Additionally, the iPhone may also gain a desktop mode; compatible models (iPhone 15 or later with USB-C). This feature may allow users to connect their iPhones to an external display for expanded screen space.iPadOS 26, which builds on iOS with tablet-specific enhancements, is said to receive a Mac-style menu bar at the top of the screen and an updated Stage Manager for improved multitasking.Apart from this, Gurman also reports that WWDC 2025 may introduce a new cross-platform gaming app from Apple. The app is expected to integrate existing Game Center features, such as leaderboards and friend lists, while also allowing users to launch games directly and providing deeper access to Apple Arcade. Details still remain limited, yet the gaming app is expected to be available not only on iPhone but also on iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.Apple continues to develop its Apple Intelligence features, focusing in 2025 on refining existing capabilities rather than introducing many new ones. Key unfinished projects from last year include a redesigned Siri that can interpret on-screen content, such as creating calendar entries from email and offer proactive, context-aware suggestions.Apple acknowledged challenges in delivering these Siri improvements consistently and now plans to include them in software updates later this year, though no exact timeline has been given.Rumored additions to Apple Intelligence include AI-powered battery management and a health-coaching tool that aggregates fitness data to offer personalized advice. At WWDC 2025, Apple is also expected to unveil developer tools to simplify integrating Apple Intelligence into third-party apps.Apple sometimes unveils hardware at WWDC, as it did with Vision Pro and new Macs in 2023. Any 2025 hardware announcements would likely target developers, making a Mac Pro with an M4 chip a plausible candidate.Devices that use new software features such as a touchscreen HomePod or AirPods with gesture-control cameras have been rumored but face technical and timing challenges.Reports also suggest that Apple is developing smart glasses as a Vision Pro successor, which may potentially arrive in 2026, and WWDC could serve as an early preview for such developer-focused hardware.","Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2025 is set to be held between June 9 and June 13. The Cupertino-based tech giant's annual event typically offers enough previews to interest a broader audience. This year's conference is expected to introduce an entirely new look for much of Apple's software, aiming for a more unified experience across iPhones, tablets, and computers. Apple Intelligence, which was the focus of last year's WWDC, is also expected to return in 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121496521,imgsize-243308,width-400,resizemode-4/Apple-WWDC-2025-5-major-announcements-to-expect-from-the-iPhone-makers-annual-developer-conference.jpg"

Google I/O 2025: AI Ultra tier, AI Mode on Search and more

Google’s commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) dates back much further than many may realise. While CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly described Google as an “AI-first” company since 2016, the concept was first outlined by co-founder Larry Page in 2000. At the time, with Google still in its early stages, Page predicted that AI will eventually become the ultimate version of the search engine.Page talked about Google being an AI company when the company was merely two years old.""Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google,"" he said, adding, ""It would understand, you know, exactly what you wanted. And it would give you the right thing.""""And that's obviously artificial intelligence, you know. It would be able to answer any question, basically, because almost everything is on the web, right?,"" Page explained (via Business Insider).Page stated that Google operated approximately 6,000 computers to maintain around 100 copies of the web. Describing the scale of computation and data storage, Page remarked, ""A lot of computation, a lot of data that didn't used to be available.""He further emphasised the challenge involved, noting, ""From an engineering scientific standpoint, building things to make use of this is a really interesting intellectual exercise. So I expected to be doing that for a while.""At this year's Google's annual I/O developer conference, the company showcased the company's intensified focus on AI, unveiling significant AI updates across its product ecosystem. Key announcements included smarter Gemini 2.5 models (Pro with ""Deep Think"" and an improved Flash), the launch of Google Beam (formerly Project Starline) for 3D video conferencing, and a new $250/month AI Ultra subscription for advanced features.Google also revealed a complete AI overhaul for Search, introduced Android XR for smart glasses (Project Aura), and brought AI-powered Smart Replies to Gmail and real-time translation to Google Meet. Enhancements to the AI Agent (Project Mariner), the universal AI assistant (Project Astra), and more realistic AI video (Veo 3) and image (Imagen 4) generation models underscored Google's AI-first future.","Google co-founder Larry Page predicted in 2000 that artificial intelligence would become the ultimate version of the search engine.

GTA 6 screenshots recreated in Cyberpunk 2077 showcase Rockstar’s next-gen visual leap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/gta-6-screenshots-recreated-in-cyberpunk-2077-showcase-rockstars-next-gen-visual-leap/articleshow/121498345.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

Cyberpunk recreations highlight GTA 6's visual transformation

Record-breaking trailer sparks fan imagination through long wait





A committed Cyberpunk 2077 gamer has remade a number of the biggest Grand Theft Auto 6 screenshots released with Trailer 2 this month. Through the use of mods, they synchronized lighting, poses, and composition to closely replicate Rockstar's initial footage. The result isn't merely a nod to GTA 6's initial look, it's also an unmistakable demonstration of how much further Rockstar is taking graphical realism compared to other contemporary triple-A games.Reddit user Party-Scallion-189 undertook the ambitious task of recreating GTA 6 screenshots within the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Utilizing character Panam as a proxy for Lucia, they replicated major trailer moments, from Lucia mid-punch to her lounging in a swimming pool. Multiple mods were employed to tweak character poses, facial expressions, lighting effects, and even camera angles, creating some very detailed side-by-side comparisons.Even though the creator insisted the intention wasn't to crown a victor in a graphics battle, fans couldn't help but observe vast contrasts. The GTA 6 screenshots, built upon Rockstar's in-game footage, have more realistic skin details, gentler natural lighting, and deeper environmental immersion.Even with Cyberpunk 2077's reputation for visuals, the comparison only serves to illustrate just how evolved GTA 6's visual fidelity already looks, particularly the fact that the game isn't due for release for another year.The timing of this video endeavor could not be more apt. Rockstar's second GTA 6 trailer, which dropped on May 6, set internet records at more than 475 million views in 24 hours, creating unprecedented heat on platforms. In addition to it, Rockstar dropped more than 70 new images, providing fans with more than ample material to examine, remix, and re-imagine.With GTA 6 officially pushed back to May 26, 2026, fans are getting creative about what they can do in the meantime. From hunting for easter eggs to photo recreations such as this one, the community is only gaining steam while Rockstar remains silent.This remake of Cyberpunk 2077 is more than simply a cool-looking visual experiment, it's evidence of GTA 6's high level of production and dedication of its fan base. Even without gameplay, Rockstar has provided fans with enough to dream of the future. If these images are anything to go by, that future is amazing.Also Read: Voice of GTA 6’s Jason Duval possibly identified as Dylan Rourke","Reddit user Party-Scallion-189 recreated GTA 6 screenshots within the Cyberpunk 2077 universe.
