.

Four years ago, I left a toxic relationship that drained me. Soon after, I met someone who unknowingly gave me everything I needed — love, care, and unwavering support. He treats me like a life partner in every way except one: he has never said “I love you” and is firmly against marriage. He fears its responsibilities and is certain he wants to remain unmarried, while I want to marry him. This has led to repeated arguments. Now, my strict desi parents want to start looking for a match but have given me a chance to speak up if there’s someone in my life. I love him deeply and can’t imagine anyone else, yet I can’t tell them about him because, while there’s love, there’s no commitment. Hoping things might change, I recently moved in with him, but I don’t know if it will. I can’t leave him, but I also don’t want to hurt my parents. I feel completely torn. What should I do?— AnonymousFinding a loving partner, especially after a difficult relationship, seems like nothing short of a blessing. But it sounds like you’re in a deeply emotional and complex situation, feeling torn between your love for your partner and your commitment to your parents. It may help to explore what exactly about marriage makes him hesitant — does he fear the responsibilities it brings or is it the institution itself that he resists? Knowing the reasons behind resistance to a particular thing helps us navigate through it better. Moreover, reflecting on your feelings about marriage will help you communicate your needs better. Think about what marriage means to you beyond family and societal expectations. Does it provide a sense of security, validation, or something deeper? You might also consider discussing whether there’s a way to create a meaningful commitment that aligns with both of your values. After all, working through and resolving this situation would need understanding and compromise from both ends. If only one of you is expected to let go, it can lead to resentment towards the other over a period of time.After my grandmother passed away in 2020, I was eager to get married and asked my parents to start looking for a girl for marriage, unsure about caste preferences. They told me my earnings weren’t good enough. Over the next few years, I worked hard, secured a decent package, and asked again — only to receive no response from family and encounter fake profiles online. Now, at 34, after all this hassle, marriage feels pointless. Why should I struggle to impress someone I don’t even know when the chances seem so slim? Instead, I wonder if I could just adopt a child later because for me, the only thing a marriage could facilitate is that I could become a father, friend and mentor. I’m confused — why do people marry, and do I need to? Please help.— AnonymousThe decision to marry or not is deeply personal even though we’re told otherwise, many times. This also means that it is completely valid to wonder if this path is right for you. Questioning the purpose of being in a marriage when it doesn’t feel like an obvious decision to make is healthy, and can help you arrive at a conclusion that aligns with your goals. It can help to ask yourself a few questions like beyond fatherhood, what aspects of companionship and partnership matter to you? Would you feel fulfilled in the long run without a life partner, or might you eventually miss the emotional intimacy that a life partner is likely to bring in? Before you conclude that marriage is not for you, I would also encourage you to reflect on how comfortable you feel in looking for a like-minded partner beyond traditional match-making methods. Lastly, if adoption feels like a meaningful path, it may help to research the legalities and emotional aspects of raising a child as a single parent in India. Take your time to define what a fulfilling life looks like for you.I’m in my 40s, married, with children, and doing well in both work and family life. For the past few years, I’ve been in constant contact with a former colleague — junior and single. We share a deep bond, consider each other soulmates and talk regularly. She’s independent, respects me and reciprocates our connection. I support her mentally and financially when I can, and I genuinely like her but I’m unsure where this is heading. Neither of us has expressed our feelings, yet this overwhelms me and leaves me with a sense of emptiness. My spouse is aware and often taunts me about it. How do I resolve this?— AnonymousIt’s natural to feel drawn to someone outside your marriage, especially when that connection feels effortless and fulfilling. Often, this is because these connections don’t carry the same responsibilities, conflicts and daily struggles unlike marriages. Similarly, a lot of times, the qualities of the other person that we admire are also the ones we see missing in our marriage. While this may or may not be true for you, I would encourage you to reflect on this. Journalling, counselling and even a conversation with your colleague on where this is headed can provide clarity. Moreover, consider the impact of continuing this dynamic on yourself, your family and even your colleague. The fact that your spouse is aware and calls it out is a sign that it is somewhere already affecting your household. Reflect on whether this relationship aligns with your values and long-term happiness. Understanding what you truly seek, without escaping into an illusion of perfection, will guide your next steps.","I left a toxic relationship that drained me.

Pokemon GO Tour Unova 2025 (Global) starts in less than 24 hours and you might want to know how to get ato make the most out of this event. Kyurem is one of the most sought-after Pokemon, especially when it knows the move Glaciate.In this article, we will walk you through everything you need to know to get Kyurem with Glaciate in Pokemon GO.To catch Kyurem with Glaciate, you need to participate in specific events. The GO Tour: Unova Event is a significant opportunity for trainers. Trainers may come across Kyurem after fighting Black and White Kyurem in five-star raids in cities like New Taipei City and Los Angeles, where this event has previously occurred. The Charged Attack Glaciate will be familiar to every Kyurem captured during this period.For trainers outside these cities or those without tickets, there’s still hope! The GO Tour Unova: Global event begins on March 1, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. local time. This global event features the ""It's Not Over Yet"" Special Research story that allows players to choose between paths associated with Reshiram (Black Version) or Zekrom (White Version).When engaging with the ""It's Not Over Yet"" Special Research, you’ll need to make a crucial decision:- Black Version ( Reshiram ): If you choose this path, all Kyurem encountered after defeating Black Kyurem in five-star raids will know Glaciate.- White Version (Zekrom): Opting for this path means that all Kyurem caught after defeating White Kyurem will have Glaciate as well.This choice is essential for trainers aiming to maximize their chances of obtaining a Kyurem with this unique move.If you miss your chance during these events, fear not! You can also teach Kyurem Glaciate using an Elite Charged TM. This provides flexibility for trainers who may have caught a regular variant but want to enhance its moveset and get a Kyurem with Glaciate in Pokemon GOKyurem gains significant importance when it knows the move Glaciate. This move not only enhances Kyurem's battle capabilities but also unlocks unique fusion possibilities with Reshiram and Zekrom. Here's why obtaining a Kyurem with Glaciate in Pokemon GO is highly desirable for trainers:One of the primary reasons to acquire a Kyurem with Glaciate is to enable fusions with Reshiram and Zekrom. When a Kyurem that knows Glaciate is fused with Zekrom, it transforms into Black Kyurem, while fusion with Reshiram results in White Kyurem . These fusions are critical because Black Kyurem can use Freeze Shock, and White Kyurem can utilize Ice Burn, moves that also have Adventure Effects. Moreover, breaking the fusion in these creatures returns them to their original forms, with Kyurem still retaining Glaciate, allowing trainers to repeat the fusion process.Glaciate significantly boosts Kyurem's performance in PvP battles, particularly in the Master League. Since December 2022, the addition of Glaciate to Kyurem's move-pool has allowed it to make a mark in the Master League meta. It has a reliable means of damaging counters such as Zacian, Xerneas, and Togekiss, and can be a general nuisance with its Attack debuffs. Glaciate's ability to debuff the opponent's attack by one stage makes it competitive. While Kyurem might not always secure a win, it can leave opponents debuffed, providing an advantage for teammates.Also read: White Kyurem vs Black Kyurem in Pokemon GO: Which form is stronger and why? In PvE scenarios, Glaciate is a powerful Ice-type charged move. Although Kyurem lacks an Ice-type fast move, Glaciate provides it with a damage output comparable to top-tier Dragon-type Pokemon when facing bosses weak to both Dragon and Ice attacks. Kyurem with Dragon Breath and Glaciate can be a viable raid attacker, especially against Dragon-type Pokemon vulnerable to both move types. However, it's worth noting that Kyurem functions as an honorary Dragon attacker rather than a top-tier Ice attacker in many situations.","Kyurem gains significant importance when it knows the move Glaciate.

When and where to watch the Memphis Grizzlies play tonight against the New York Knicks (February 28, 2025)?

The Memphis Grizzlies are gearing up for a high-stakes showdown against the New York Knicks on Friday, February 28, at FedExForum, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star guard Ja Morant. Ja Morant , who has been a key contributor for the Grizzlies this season, is currently listed as fit to play in tonight’s game. His availability for the game remains uncertain, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his potential impact on the court. In his last 20 games, Morant has averaged 14.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 5.3 assists, showcasing his ability to facilitate the offense and create scoring opportunities.The Grizzlies’ injury report also includes Zyon Pullin, who is out with a knee injury, and Desmond Bane, who is day-to-day with a groin issue. Bane’s status adds another layer of concern for Memphis, as he has been a consistent performer, averaging 18.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists over the same 20-game span.Memphis, currently tied with the Knicks at 38-20, relies heavily on its offensive firepower, leading the NBA with 123.3 points per game. However, the potential absence of Ja Morant and Bane could disrupt their rhythm, especially against a Knicks team known for its defensive tenacity.On the other side, the Knicks are dealing with their own injury concerns. Karl-Anthony Towns is questionable with a lower-body issue, while Josh Hart and Mitchell Robinson are also listed as questionable with knee and ankle injuries, respectively. Ariel Hukporti remains out with a knee injury.The game, set to tip off at 8 p.m. ET, will be broadcast on FDSSE and MSG, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans can also engage with the action through FanDuel Fantasy, adding an extra layer of excitement to the matchup.As the Grizzlies prepare for this critical game, the uncertainty surrounding Ja Morant’s status looms large.

Joe Burrow Gets Heavily Trolled As The NFLPA Report Reveals Cincinnati Bengals Cafeteria Has Been Poorly Ranked



Fans Are Confused How It Is Possible For Cincinnati Bengals To Serve Low Quality Food To Its Players



Joe Burrow, the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, has found himself in a new controversy as a recent ranking has been released. As per the recent ranking, the Cincinnati Bengals have scored pretty poorly when it comes to the food that they serve to the players in their cafeteria. But this has not gone down too well with the fans, and Joe Burrow is being brutally trolled for it.As per the recent ranking, their food's freshness was rated 5.49/1,0 while their food had an average rating of 4.82 out of 10. Unfortunately, the Cincinnati Bengals’ cafeteria food and freshness has ranked last among all teams. But fans are in no mood for any sympathy and have dragged Joe Burrow into this.Warren Sharp recently made a post that read as “Bengals Cafeteria worse than prison” and fans have attacked the players. A fan wrote, “LMAO poor burrow has to walk thru traffic to get to the practice field and then they don't even feed him”, while another fan wrote, “Joe Burrow bringing his meals to the facility so he can eat.”A third fan wrote, “They need to save all that money to pay Joe, Chase and Higgins”, while another user wrote, “Imagine what Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase could do if they were served food greater than middle school cafeteria level.”Many fans also spoke about how the players have a massive net worth, and yet they are complaining about the food that is being served. A fan wrote, “Teams should supply some food. But why should they supply 3 meals a day? These guys make millions in most cases. They can feed themselves a meal or two a day.”Other fans are confused how it is possible for the Cincinnati Bengals to serve low quality food. A fan wrote, “How in the world could it be possible to have such a fiasco in a multi-billion-dollar business?”The team, Cincinnati Bengals, has not issued a statement about this poor ranking yet. It is not just the food that the team has ranked pretty poorly in. As per Warren Sharp’s post, even the dining area has been ranked poorly and got a score of 5.98 out of 10, which has ranked it in the 30th place out of 32 teams.Apart from this, the Cincinnati Bengals are also asking for three meals a day instead of two. Apparently, the Cincinnati Bengals are one of two teams that dont provide three meals a day.A statement from the team and the players is yet to be issued.

NBA Halftime Show Gets a Tollywood Twist with Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2

Forget the sandalwood smuggling, Pushpa Raj is now trafficking global pop culture domination. Yes, you read that right. Pushpa 2 : The Rule, a film that's already ignited a firestorm of anticipation in India, has now crashed the NBA halftime show. Think of it: Allu Arjun 's swagger, Devi Sri Prasad 's infectious beats, and the iconic Thaggede le mantra echoing through an American basketball arena. It's a crossover so wild, you'd swear it was scripted by a fever dream.So, how did Peelings , the track from Pushpa 2, find its way onto the Houston Rockets vs. Milwaukee Bucks halftime stage? It's a testament to the sheer, undeniable power of infectious music and a cultural moment that's transcending geographical boundaries. A video capturing the spectacle has exploded online, showcasing dancers in vibrant blue and gold, channeling the energy of the song and, of course, the signature Pushpa Raj attitude.This isn't just a fun dance performance, it's a massive win for Pushpa 2. It's a declaration that Indian cinema, particularly Telugu cinema, is no longer confined to its traditional audience. The NBA halftime show is a coveted platform, a global stage watched by millions. For Pushpa 2, this exposure translates to unprecedented international visibility, building hype far beyond the film's initial release. It's a strategic move, a cultural infiltration that's cleverly tapping into the global appetite for vibrant, engaging entertainment.While Peelings is grabbing headlines, it's worth noting that this isn't the first Telugu song to grace an NBA halftime. Kurchi Madathapetti from Guntur Kaaram also brought the Telugu groove to the basketball court. However, the sheer anticipation surrounding Pushpa 2 elevates this moment to another level. The film's already established fanbase, coupled with the global reach of the NBA, creates a potent cocktail of cultural exchange.ALSO READ: Kyrie Irving Makes Fan’s Dream Come True with Custom Sneakers Surprise vs Los Angeles Lakers The Pushpa 2 team's ambition to go global is clearly paying off.

Cam Newton Defends Shilo and Shedeur Sanders Amid Nepotism Criticism



Cam Newton Gets Real About Dating NFL Stars, NO. 1 Pick Expectations + Using ChatGPT To Get Girls!?

Shilo Sanders and Shedeur Sanders have faced an intense amount of criticism throughout their football careers, with many attributing their success to nepotism due to their father, Deion Sanders . While living up to Deion’s legendary legacy is already a challenge, the added scrutiny has made their journey even more demanding. However, NFL veteran Cam Newton is not swayed by the ‘unfair advantage’ narrative surrounding the Sanders brothers.Not everyone can be criticized as nepotism product, at least Cam Newton does not think so. During an episode of Unapologetically Angel, Newton recently pointed out the frequent use of the term nepotism, emphasizing, ""They come up with all types of societal words and this year we’ve heard nepotism as much as any other thing."" Despite the criticism, Newton stands firmly in support of Deion Sanders, praising his role as a dedicated father who is actively shaping his sons' futures.Newton's perspective on the issue is deeply personal, as he is also a father guiding his children through the world of sports. With eight kids of his own, Newton is no stranger to the pressures and responsibilities of parenthood. His eldest son, Chosen Sebastian, is already making his mark in football, basketball, and track and field, while his daughter Sovereign-Dior Cambella and son Camidas Swain are actively participating in multiple sports.Having been in Deion’s shoes, Newton understands the importance of providing opportunities for his children. He also acknowledges the stigma surrounding Black fathers in society and believes that Deion has shattered those stereotypes. ""What Deion Sanders has been doing and has displayed, has been nothing less of a proud father,"" Newton explained. He emphasized that Deion’s active involvement in his children’s lives challenges the misconceptions about Black fatherhood, stating that Sanders has been ""smushing, killing, flushing, and murdering any type of thought process of what a Black father would be in this country.""Interestingly, Newton himself is a product of nepotism. His father, Cecil Newton Sr., played as a safety for the Cowboys and Bills in the 1980s, which helped Cam access valuable coaching and resources early in his career. However, Newton argues that while connections can open doors, maintaining success requires hard work and talent, which Shilo and Shedeur have undoubtedly demonstrated.Deion Sanders' impact on his sons goes beyond the football field. He has been a hands-on father, guiding Shilo and Shedeur through their athletic journeys and helping them shine even in challenging environments like Colorado’s football program. Their success story in the Big 12, despite the team’s struggles, shows their talent and Deion’s dedication.Newton defends Deion's actions, stating, ""To have been doing what he’s been doing for all of his kids, not just one or two of them, has been commendable, and for anybody who doesn’t like it, you just have to ask what would you do in that situation… If somebody’s son is good enough to play, of course, you want your son to play for you and you’re lying if you don’t."" This perspective resonates with many parents who wish to see their children succeed.Also Read: Justin Tucker’s sexual misconduct allegations spark debate over equal treatment with Browns' Deshaun Watson While critics may continue to label Shilo and Shedeur as beneficiaries of nepotism, Cam Newton views Deion’s efforts as a blueprint of fatherhood — a father ensuring his children carry on his legacy. The journey has not been easy, but the Sanders brothers are proving their worth on the field, showing that talent and perseverance are what truly define success.","Cam Newton has defended Shilo and Shedeur Sanders amid nepotism criticism. Newton believes Deion Sanders is a dedicated father who is shaping his sons' futures. Deion has shattered stereotypes of what a Black father would be in the U.S., says Newton.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118563927,imgsize-61384,width-400,resizemode-4/118563927.jpg"
Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry’s New 3-Point Record Leaves Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson in the Dust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/golden-state-warriors-stephen-currys-new-3-point-record-leaves-damian-lillard-and-klay-thompson-in-the-dust/articleshow/118615384.cms,"Credits: NBA

Is Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry’s 3-Point Record the Most Unbreakable Stat in NBA History?

In the realm of NBA three-point shooting, there's Stephen Curry , and then there's everyone else. It's like comparing a supernova to a sparkler. While Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson are certified sharpshooters, Curry's recent exploits are less a demonstration of skill and more a display of basketball sorcery. Take the Golden State Warriors ' recent East Coast swing opener against the Orlando Magic. Even when the Dubs faced a daunting early deficit, Curry, simply rewrote the script.He started slow, almost toying with the Magic, before unleashing a second-quarter inferno. It was almost four minutes into the first quarter before the two-time MVP made his first shot. He scored the opening points of the game for the Warriors after draining a 28-footer. Orlando surged to a 34-23 lead as Curry closed the quarter with five points and two assists. Steph Curry scored 16 points in the second quarter, including the final three-pointer, a 49-footer, which reduced the Magic's lead to 66-52.When you see ""Most games with 9+ 3-pointers made in NBA history,"" it reads:45 — Steph Curry14 — Damian Lillard12 — Klay ThompsonYou don't just see a number, you witness a chasm. A canyon. A continental divide.Lillard and Thompson, two titans of the long ball, are relegated to the 'also-rans' section of the Curry story. It's not a slight on their abilities, but a testament to Curry's otherworldly consistency. They're like elite chefs forced to watch a culinary demigod effortlessly whip up a five-star meal while blindfolded. Imagine trying to explain to a casual fan that someone has more than three times the number of elite shooting performances than their closest competitors. It's like explaining quantum physics with interpretive dance.ALSO READ: Why Kevin Durant Said NO: The Real Reason He Killed Potential Golden State Warriors Trade Curry's dominance isn't just about making shots; it's about altering the very fabric of the game. He's redefined what's possible, forcing defenses to stretch to absurd lengths, and inspiring a generation of kids to launch shots from the logo. So, while Lillard and Thompson continue to light up scoreboards, Curry's legacy is etched in a different stratosphere, a place where gravity bends and three-pointers fall like rain.",Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is the most prolific three-point shooter in NBA history. Curry has made more three-pointers than Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson combined.

Miami Heat’s injury report for tonight’s game against the Indiana Pacers (February 28, 2025)

When and where to watch the Indiana Pacers play tonight against the Miami Heat (February 28, 2025)?

The Indiana Pacers are set to take on the Miami Heat this Friday, February 28, at 8 p.m. ET, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star guard Tyrese Haliburton. While Haliburton isn’t listed on the Pacers’ injury report, his recent performance and health remain critical as Indiana looks to maintain its playoff push. Tyrese Haliburton is fit to play tonight against the Miami Heat. The Pacers’ injury report currently features two players: T.J. McConnell, who is questionable with an ankle injury, and Isaiah Jackson, who is out for the season with a calf issue. McConnell’s potential absence could impact the team’s depth, but Haliburton’s availability ensures the Pacers retain their primary playmaker. Over the last 20 games, Haliburton has been a steady force, averaging 17.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 2.9 three-pointers per game, making him one of the team’s most reliable contributors.On the other side, the Miami Heat are dealing with their own injury woes. Bam Adebayo, a cornerstone of their lineup, is questionable with a calf injury, while Andrew Wiggins is also questionable due to an ankle issue. Nikola Jovic (hand) and Dru Smith (Achilles) are out, with Smith sidelined for the season. These absences could tilt the game in Indiana’s favor, especially if Adebayo is unable to suit up.The Pacers enter the matchup with a 33-24 record, outperforming opponents by 1.2 points per game. Their offense ranks ninth in the league, scoring 116.4 points per game, while their defense sits at 20th, allowing 115.2 points. Tyrese Haliburton’s ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting (18th in the NBA) and facilitate for teammates like Pascal Siakam (21.6 points per game) will be crucial against Miami’s seventh-ranked defense.Miami, meanwhile, has struggled offensively, ranking 24th with 110 points per game. Tyler Herro, their leading scorer at 24 points per game, will need to step up if Adebayo is limited or unavailable.As both teams prepare for this pivotal Eastern Conference clash, Tyrese Haliburton’s health and performance could be the difference-maker. Fans can catch the action live on FDSSUN and FDSIN or stream it via Fubo, with regional restrictions applying.Also read: Will Bam Adebayo play tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

Accidental activation raises safety concerns

What affected customers should do

Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs. The advisory, posted on Wednesday, follows reports of incidents where the stovetop elements were unintentionally turned on by people or pets, reports CBS news.According to Health Canada, the issue affects more than 137,000 units sold in the country between 2016 and June 2024. As of February 12, LG Electronics Canada had received eight reports of such incidents, including two minor injuries—a cut and a burn.The affected models have five stovetop elements and control knobs positioned at the front, just above the oven door. If accidentally bumped, these knobs can turn on the heating elements, posing a fire risk.A similar recall has been issued in the United States, where approximately 500,000 units were sold between 2015 and January 2025. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported at least 86 cases of unintended activation, resulting in eight minor injuries and five fires, with property damage exceeding $340,000 USD. Tragically, three of these fires involved pet fatalities.Owners of the recalled models do not need to discard their stoves but should take immediate action. LG Electronics Canada advises customers to check the model number, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer, and compare it with the recall list.Once identified, customers should contact LG to receive a free warning label and instructions on its placement. The label serves as a reminder to use the ""Lock Out/Control Lock"" function, which disables the heating elements when the range is not in use. LG has also provided an instructional video demonstrating how to activate this safety feature.","Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs.

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

US President Donald Trump is not happy with the UK government 's demand to Apple to provide a technical “back door” to access user data. In a recent interview with UK-based magazine 'The Spectator', the US President Donald Trump criticized the UK government's request for Apple to grant access to certain user data, comparing it to practices commonly associated with China.He conveyed this sentiment to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during their meeting at the White House earlier this week, where they also discussed topics like Ukraine and a bilateral trade agreement.Donald Trump likened the UK government's demand that Apple, opens new tab grant it access to some user data as ""something that you hear about with China"".

That's something, you know, that you hear about with China,"" Trump said in his first magazine interview.Additionally, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard indicated that America is investigating whether the UK's actions violate the CLOUD Act , which restricts cross-border data access demands. In a letter to British lawmakers, she wrote that the UK government’s order for Apple to create a “backdoor” to iCloud users’ accounts is a “clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties”.“Any information sharing between a government – any government – and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote.Apple removes encryption for UK users, says left with no choiceIn response to the UK's demands, Apple recently discontinued its Advanced Data Protection feature for iCloud users in the UK. Apple removed its encryption feature altogether. The company said it had been given no choice and that it was disappointed at being forced to eliminate Advanced Data Protection.
