Liam Lawson Expects a Challenging Red Bull F1 Debut



Liam Lawson on the 2025 F1 Season, Advice For Rookies, & George Russell's Escape Room Skills

Liam Lawson is set to make his highly anticipated full-season debut in Formula 1, stepping into a Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen . However, the young Kiwi is under no illusions about the challenges ahead. With only 11 grand prix starts under his belt, all of which came in the latter half of 2023 and 2024, Lawson acknowledges that adapting to the demands of a full F1 calendar will be a daunting task.Liam Lawson was officially named as Sergio Perez’s replacement in December, following a disappointing season for the Mexican driver. Despite Red Bull’s dominant performance last year, the 22-year-old driver is not expecting immediate success, particularly given his lack of experience on several circuits that feature early in the 2025 calendar.The upcoming season will introduce Lawson to a host of unfamiliar tracks, adding an extra layer of difficulty to his transition into one of F1’s most competitive seats. “Going into a year like this, especially the start of the season, I’m going to a lot of tracks I haven’t done before,” he admitted. “I think the start of the year is going to be the hardest as well. Going to a bunch of tracks I haven’t done before starting the season, it’s going to be very, very tough.”While the Red Bull RB21 is expected to be a front-running car, Lawson is not setting unrealistic expectations for himself. His early-season schedule includes challenging circuits like Melbourne, Shanghai, Miami, and Montreal—places he has either never raced on or only experienced in junior categories. Nonetheless, he remains eager to embrace the challenge, stating, “I’m very excited for Melbourne and I’m very excited for the start of the year.”Despite the uphill battle, Lawson is looking forward to proving himself at the highest level. “There’s a lot of cool tracks that I haven’t done that I think I will enjoy, like Melbourne. China looks like a cool track, Canada is somewhere I’ve always wanted to drive.”Also Read: ""Anyone who doubts him is silly"": Lando Norris slams critics of Lewis Hamilton ahead of Ferrari F1 debut With a new team, heightened expectations, and an uncharted season ahead, Lawson is prepared for what could be his toughest yet most rewarding year in Formula 1.","Liam Lawson is set to make his full-season debut in Formula 1 with Red Bull.

Mikey Madison won the best actress prize for Brooklyn tragicomedy “Anora.”“Conclave,” which stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal corralling conniving clergy as they elect a new pope, beat “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” Bob Dylan biopic “ A Complete Unknown "" to the top prize. ""Conclave” was also named outstanding British film and took trophies for editing and adapted screenplay.Supporting performer prizes went to Kieran Culkin for “A Real Pain” and Zoe Saldaña for “Emilia Pérez,"" which also won the award for best film not in the English language.Saldaña won for her role as a lawyer who helps the title character transition to a woman and out of a life of crime. She called the film “the creative challenge of a lifetime.”Best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, who stars as the titular transgender ex-cartel boss in “Emilia Pérez,” wasn’t at the ceremony. Gascón has withdrawn from promoting the film, which has 13 Oscar nominations, amid controversy over her social media posts disparaging Muslims, George Floyd and diversity at the Oscars.Audiard has condemned those comments, but in his acceptance speech thanked Gascón and her co-stars Saldaña and Selena Gomez.“I am deeply proud of what we have all achieved together,"" he said.From the BAFTAs to the OscarsStars including Cynthia Erivo, Hugh Grant, Ariana Grande, Lupita Nyong’o, Timothée Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan walked the red carpet at London’s Royal Festival Hall for the awards, known as BAFTAs.The prizes will be watched for clues about who will triumph at Hollywood’s Academy Awards on March 2, in an unusually hard-to-call awards season.They also have a distinctly British accent. The ceremony kicked off with its kilt-wearing host, Scottish actor David Tennant, leading the audience in a rousing singalong of The Proclaimers’ anthem “I’m Gonna be (500 Miles).”Culkin's award came for “A Real Pain,” about odd couple cousins on a trip to explore their roots. The film's writer and co-star, Jesse Eisenberg, took the BAFTA for best original screenplay.“I’d like to share this with my wife, who didn’t come because she didn’t think I’d win,” Eisenberg quipped.“Anora,” about an exotic dancer entangled with a Russian oligarch's son, had been a best picture favorite after winning the top prizes last week at the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards.“The Brutalist” had nine BAFTA nominations, while “Anora,” the sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” and musical “Wicked” hade seven each. “A Complete Unknown” and Irish-language hip-hop drama “Kneecap” received six nominations apiece.Brody won over stiff competition from Fiennes and Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” The other male actors nominated were Grant for his creepy role in the horror film “ Heretic,” Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama “ Sing Sing ” and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “ The Apprentice.”Stan, who is also Oscar nominated, said it was “incredibly validating” to get recognition for the film, which initially struggled to find an American distributor. It's an origins story that focuses on Trump's relationship with ruthless power broker Roy Cohn, played by Jeremy Strong.“We were told this was going to be a thankless job that was never going to lead to anything,” Stan said, describing the movie as a “fair” depiction of the president.Best-actress nominees were Madison, Gascón, Demi Moore for body-horror film “ The Substance,” Ronan for “The Outrun,” Erivo for “Wicked” and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for the Mike Leigh drama “Hard Truths.” Erivo or Jean-Baptiste would have been the first non-white performer to win the leading actress BAFTA.Animated caper “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” won awards for best animated feature and best family and children’s film.Sci-fi epic “Dune: Part Two” won prizes for sound and visual effects. “The Brutalist” won for cinematography and musical score. Musical “Wicked” took the costume and production design trophies.Rising stars and lifetime honorsBritain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.Most winners are chosen by 8,000 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals, with one — the Rising Star Award —- selected by public vote from a shortlist of nominees. This year's winner was David Jonsson, star of high finance drama series “Industry” and London rom-com “Rye Lane.”“Star, I don’t know,” he said. “But rising, I guess.”“Willow” and “Return of the Jedi” actor Warwick Davis received the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA Fellowship, for his screen career and work to create a more inclusive film industry.He founded a talent agency for actors under 5 feet tall, because, he said, “short actors weren’t known for their talent, just their height.”BAFTA chairwoman Sara Putt sent a message of strength to everyone hit by last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires. Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “The Last Showgirl,” was absent because the fires delayed filming on her current work.The event was without a dash of royal glamour this year. Neither Prince William, who is honorary president of the British film academy, nor his wife Kate are attending. The awards coincide with school holidays for their three children.William, 42, sent a recorded video message that was played before the presentation of the Rising Star Award.","Papal thriller ""Conclave "" wins four prizes including best picture.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

32-year-old woman declared cancer free after UK’s first liver transplant for advanced bowel cancer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/32-year-old-woman-declared-cancer-free-after-uks-first-liver-transplant-for-advanced-bowel-cancer/articleshow/116994549.cms,"Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free after becoming the first person in the UK to undergo a liver transplant for advanced bowel cancer. In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

""The Bulls have recently made Patrick Williams available in trade talks, per Joe Cowley,"" Sidery shared. ""Williams just signed a five-year, $90 million extension with Chicago in the offseason.""

Theare looking to address some defensive weaknesses as they continue to push for a postseason spot in the NBA. After a hard-fought 122-114 victory over the Washington Wizards, the Warriors' record now stands at 21-20, placing them in the Western Conference's No. 10 seed. Despite the win, however, there are notable concerns for the team, particularly in their defensive play.One of the main issues highlighted during the Wizards' game was the Golden State Warriors ' inability to contain Washington's Jordan Poole, who torched them for 38 points. Adding to the concern, the Wizards shot an impressive 48.9% from the three-point line on 45 attempts, despite ranking near the bottom of the league in three-point shooting. This performance underscored the Warriors' need for a reliable defender capable of limiting opponents' scoring and providing an additional offensive threat.To remedy this, Golden State has reportedly set its sights on acquiring a versatile forward. The team's general manager, Mike Dunleavy, is said to be targeting a player who can guard opposing stars while also contributing on the offensive end as a reliable shooter. With Andrew Wiggins being one of their few consistent defenders, the Golden State Warriors are in search of someone who can step up and fill the void left by others in the rotation.Enter Patrick Williams , a former No. 4 overall pick from the 2020 NBA Draft. Williams, currently with the Chicago Bulls , has been made available in trade talks, according to Evan Sidery of Forbes.At just 23 years old, Williams has shown promise as a two-way player. This season, he's averaging 9.3 points and 3.8 rebounds while shooting 36.2% from beyond the arc. Despite a dip in his offensive efficiency, Williams remains a solid defender and a career 40.1% shooter from three-point range. His defensive consistency and ability to stretch the floor make him an intriguing target for the Golden State Warriors.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Golden State Warriors eye Mavericks' $40 million star center in blockbuster trade talks to strengthen their roster If Golden State can work out a trade, they may offer a young prospect like Moses Moody or Brandin Podziemski, along with draft picks, to the Bulls in exchange for Williams.

Who is Rhea Ripley’s mother?

While Mami is renowned in the wrestling world, her parents, especially her mother have remained out of the limelight watching her daughter succeed from the sidelines.Rhea Ripley became a top fixture for WWE in the modern era.

The ‘

Mixture of Experts

’ Trick

The Decimal Game

Why Didn’t Others Do It?

China’s DeepSeek has pulled off an AI miracle—building a top-tier artificial intelligence model while spending far less than its American rivals. At a time when AI giants are burning billions on GPUs and power-hungry data centers, this start-up has figured out a way to do more with less.The secret? A mix of smart engineering, a clever neural network design , and some good old-fashioned mathematical efficiency.Most AI firms stack their data centers with thousands of GPUs—Meta’s latest AI model reportedly ran on 16,000 specialized chips, each costing around $40,000. DeepSeek? Just 2,000. Their total compute cost? A mere $6 million, almost a tenth of what Meta is rumored to have spent.The key to DeepSeek’s frugal success? A method called ""mixture of experts."" Traditional AI models try to learn everything in one giant neural network. That’s like stuffing all knowledge into a single brain—inefficient and power-hungry.DeepSeek, instead, split the system into specialized mini-networks—one for poetry, one for coding, another for biology, and so on. Each ""expert"" focused on its domain, while a ""generalist"" network acted as a bridge, coordinating them.Think of it like a newsroom: specialist reporters cover specific beats, while an editor connects the dots.If that wasn’t enough, DeepSeek also squeezed efficiency out of pure mathematics. AI models rely on mind-boggling amounts of number crunching, typically using 16-bit precision. DeepSeek? They slashed it to 8 bits—halving memory use and speeding up calculations.Losing precision sounds risky, right? Not really. Just like rounding π to 3.14 works for most practical uses, trimming decimals didn’t hurt the AI’s performance. And when needed, DeepSeek stretched the final results back to 32-bit accuracy—giving them the best of both worlds.AI giants like OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind have the brains and the budget, so why didn’t they crack this code first? Simple: risk.Building AI models is expensive, and experimenting with new techniques can burn millions with no guarantee of success. DeepSeek took that gamble—and it paid off.Now that they’ve published their findings, the industry is taking note. AI development just got a whole lot cheaper. The question is—who will be the next to follow suit?","China's DeepSeek has built a top-tier artificial intelligence model while spending far less than its American rivals. Their total compute cost?

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest. It's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109747883,imgsize-54170,width-400,resizemode-4/109747883.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Conservative influencer and author Ashley St. Clair recently made headlines after claiming she gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child five months ago. The revelation, shared via social media, sparked widespread debate, but St. Clair has now provided more details in an exclusive interview with the New York Post. The 26-year-old described her alleged romance with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO as a secretive affair, stating that Musk, 53, wanted to keep their child hidden for security reasons.According to St. Clair, their relationship began with online exchanges that led to in-person meetings and eventually a pregnancy she was told to keep confidential. While Musk has not publicly confirmed or denied the claim, St. Clair maintains that their child exists and has even met some of Musk’s other children and his mother, Maye Musk.St. Clair claims her connection with Musk started on X (formerly Twitter), the social media platform he acquired in 2022. Their interaction allegedly began with Musk reacting to her posts, which eventually led to direct messages between them.St. Clair told the New York Post.At the time, St. Clair had no particular interest in Musk beyond his involvement with Twitter, but their conversations became more frequent. She stated that Musk eventually asked her if she ever traveled to San Francisco or Austin—two locations where he frequently works due to his commitments with Tesla, SpaceX, and X.During this period, St. Clair was working for a conservative satirical website. After Musk restored the website’s Twitter account following an eight-month suspension for making a controversial joke, she was invited to San Francisco to interview him.Following their first in-person meeting, Musk allegedly messaged her shortly after, asking:According to St. Clair, their romance took off from there.St. Clair claims that when she became pregnant, she was required to keep it an absolute secret. She was allegedly instructed not to share the news with anyone outside of a small circle of trusted individuals.She further stated that Musk provided her with a luxury apartment and heightened security measures but maintained a strict level of secrecy regarding their alleged child. She described feeling lonely throughout her pregnancy but was willing to stay silent for the safety of her child.However, as time passed, St. Clair claims that tabloids began to catch wind of her pregnancy and intended to break the story. Fearing that the media would expose the information before she could control the narrative, she decided to make a public announcement herself.On February 14, 2025, she posted on X:Her post instantly went viral, igniting widespread speculation and controversy.St. Clair claims that her child has already met some of Musk’s other 12 children. Musk has several children from previous relationships, including his twins and triplets with his first wife, Justine Wilson, as well as his children with musician Grimes and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis.Additionally, St. Clair alleges that she has spent time with Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, though she has not disclosed further details about their interactions.Despite these claims, Musk himself has not directly commented on St. Clair’s announcement. His only public reaction has been a cryptic response to a fan’s comment on X, where he posted a laughing emoji in response to the situation being referred to as one of his many ""side quests.""The public response to St. Clair’s claims has been divided. Many social media users have expressed skepticism, demanding concrete evidence to support her statements. Others believe that Musk’s lack of a direct denial could indicate that there is some truth to her claims.Media outlets have attempted to reach Musk and his representatives for a statement, but so far, there has been no official confirmation or denial from his camp.Meanwhile, discussions about the implications of the alleged relationship continue to trend online. Some have questioned whether Musk, known for his advocacy of population growth, would have intentionally kept the birth of another child a secret. Others believe that the tech billionaire, who is constantly under public scrutiny, may have legitimate security concerns regarding his family.",Conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair claims she gave birth to Elon Musk’s 13th child five months ago.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.
