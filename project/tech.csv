LVIV: Yevhen Pramonov, a member of a Ukrainian special forces battalion, lost his legs while clearing mines in Donetsk region last Dec. Working non-stop for 24 days at the time, he had stepped on a Russian mine, triggering an explosion that left him critically injured. Evacuated amid heavy gunfire, he survived thanks to first aid and, later, the expertise of the Superhumans Centre in Lviv.The centre, launched after the full-scale Russian invasion, has become alifeline for soldiers and civilians alike. Specialising in prosthetics , mental health support, reconstructive surgery, and rehabilitation, it has treated more than 625 people and provided 850 prosthetic limbs.But its success would have been difficult without Aether Biomedical, a company founded by two Indian innovators which has provided advanced bionic arms for soldiers. So far, Aether Biomedical has supplied 70 bionic arms to amputees at the centre.Aether Biomedical is a Polish company founded by Dhruv Agrawal and Faith Jiwakhan , both from Vardhman Mahavir Medical College, New Delhi. Their journey into prosthetic innovation began when they met a man born without a limb and lacking access to functional prosthetics.Determined to make a difference, they created the prototype for a bionic hand, ‘Zeus’, in a small room during their first year of medical school. The company focuses on developing advanced, multifunctional prosthetic hands activated by the user’s muscle signals.Dhruv explains: “Our prosthetics use electrodes connected to the user’s muscles to transmit signals to an algorithm, which then converts the signals into precise movements.” The prosthetics are 3D printed, remotely configurable, and locally repairable — a precious feature for Ukrainians who require maintenance in a war-torn country. Agrawal notes that with the conflict intensifying, there is “a pressing need for prosthetics as thousands have been forced to undergo amputations”.Dhruv adds: “Usually, bionic hands are weak, break easily, and take forever to repair. Our arm is the strongest in the world. It has a gripping capacity of 35kg, damage-resistant fingers designed to withstand the impact of daily life, and it can be repaired locally rather than being sent back to the manufacturer.”According to Dr Jiwakhan, the arm uses web-based software to make remote adjustments: “We have developed a digital platform for the ‘Zeus’ hand that connects clinicians and patients through a cloudbased mobile app. Clinicians can remotely configure the prosthetic, monitor device usage and make real-time adjustments. This ensures patients receive end-to-end support throughout their journey.”“I was bleeding heavily after the blast,” Yevhen recalls. “When I woke up in hospital, I knew my life had changed, but Ialso knew I wanted to keep serving my country.” Yevhen, now, after receiving bionic limbs, plans to return to the armed forces to deliver lectures at a military academy.Superhumans Centre offers prosthetic limbs free of charge, and is funded by international organisations. A mechanical knee prosthesis can range from euro 18,000 to 20,000, while a below-the-knee prosthesis costs about euro 9,000. More advanced myoelectric hands, like ‘Zeus’, cost between euro 15,000 and 50,000.","A Polish company founded by two Indians is providing advanced bionic arms for soldiers and civilians alike.

FOX Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen interrupted his live coverage of Hurricane Helene in Atlanta on Friday to rescue a woman trapped in her car by rising floodwaters. In the video, Van Dillen can be seen standing in the rain with the submerged vehicle behind him, describing how the woman drove into the flooded area. The woman's screams can be heard as Van Dillen assures her that help is on the way.""It's a situation.We'll get back to you in a little bit. I'm going to see if I can help this lady out a little bit more you guys,"" Van Dillen says to the camera before wading through the water with the woman on his back, carrying her to safety.In a later interview for ""Fox & Friends"", Van Dillen explained that he couldn't wait for first responders to arrive when he saw the woman in danger. ""I know that we're swamped here with all of the 911 calls, because there are so many high-water rescues that we've already documented so far… [she] called 911 and, five minutes, 10 minutes, and you could hear screaming, right? You could hear through my live shot, real loud,"" he said.Van Dillen described the rescue, saying, ""I took my wallet out of my pants, and I went in there, waded in, got chest deep."" He added that the water temperature was around 80 degrees, and the current wasn't too strong. The woman was still strapped into her car, with the water rising and almost reaching her neck. Van Dillen instructed her to undo her seatbelt and give him her phone and bags before carrying her to safety.When asked what would have happened if he hadn't intervened, Van Dillen humbly replied, ""You know, I don't know."" He mentioned that the woman was in shock, cold, and shivering, so he gave her one of his shirts to warm up. About 20 minutes later, the fire department arrived, checked on them, and moved on to the next rescue.Hurricane Helene left a devastating path of destruction across Florida and the southeastern US on Friday, claiming at least 44 lives and causing extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. The category 4 hurricane knocked out power to some hospitals in southern Georgia and forced authorities to use chainsaws to clear debris and open roads. Moody's Analytics estimates the property damage to be between $15 billion and $26 billion.","Fox Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen interrupted his live coverage of Hurricane Helene in Atlanta on Friday to rescue a woman trapped in her car by rising floodwaters.

Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What is the “Peaklight” malware

""This memory-only dropper decrypts and executes a PowerShell-based downloader. This PowerShell-based downloader is being tracked as PEAKLIGHT,”

How hackers can use Peaklight to infect Windows PCs

Connection to a hidden source: It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive.

It connects to a content delivery network (CDN) that conceals harmful JavaScript code. This code executes directly in a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the system’s hard drive. Unleashing the malware downloader : The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight.

The JavaScript then activates a PowerShell script named Peaklight. Downloading more threats: Peaklight acts as a downloader, retrieving additional malware from a remote server. This could include dangerous programs like Lumma Stealer, Hijack Loader, and CryptBot, which can steal user data or give attackers control of the user's computer.

""PEAKLIGHT is an obfuscated PowerShell-based downloader that is part of a multi-stage execution chain that checks for the presence of ZIP archives in hard-coded file paths. If the archives do not exist, the downloader will reach out to a CDN site download the remotely hosted archive file and save it to disk.”

A novel type of malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites. This “advanced” malware is designed to infect Windows computers, ultimately deploying information stealers and loaders. Security researchers affiliated with Google’s cybersecurity firm Mandiant have issued a stark warning regarding the potential risks associated with visiting such websites, which encompass not only legal repercussions but also the exposure to malware such as Peaklight.In a blog post, Mandiant claims that Peaklight is a new and stealthy malware that operates entirely within a computer's memory, leaving no trace on the hard drive which makes it difficult to detect. Security researchers claimed that this malware is designed to discreetly download additional harmful software onto infected Windows systems.Mandiant noted.Mandiant explained that Peaklight uses a covert PowerShell script to deploy additional malware onto infected systems. This method facilitates the distribution of harmful programs such as Lumma Stealer , Hijack Loader, and CryptBot. These programs are offered as services for rent, enabling cyber attackers to steal information or take control of compromised computers.As per the report, cybercriminals are spreading the malware through fake movie downloads. For this, hackers are hiding dangerous Windows shortcut files (LNKs) within ZIP folders disguised as popular films.Once opened, the LNK file triggers the following chain reaction:The report noted that the malware was particularly stealthy because it operates entirely within the computer's memory (RAM). This makes it very difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect, as most antivirus programs primarily scan the user’s hard drive for threats.Mandiant researchers Aaron Lee and Praveeth D'Souza said:","Malware known as Peaklight has emerged and is specifically targeting individuals who engage in the downloading of movies from illicit websites.

She has learned to show up powerfully and has cultivated her confidence, allowing her to carve her own path, and most impressively, take up space and speak her mind - Attributes that have served her well as the youngest General Manager in @WWENXT history,"" (Via Dany Garcia’s Instagram Post)

“I am endlessly proud of my daughter, along with her fellow Gen Z Latinos (1 in 4 of all Gen Z!) who are fearlessly shaping our futures and advocating for others in the process."" (Via Dany Garcia’s Instagram Post)

""I had her when I was young, in my twenties. So when I had Simone, I was flying by the seat of my pants. I was wrestling full-time. I started transitioning into movies full time. I had so much sh*t going on. I like to say that me and Simone grew up together but we had a relationship where I was always gone and we tried to keep it together. Now, years later, as she becomes a pro wrestler, it's actually brought us closer together,"" (Via
