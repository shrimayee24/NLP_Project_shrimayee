Jody Fortson’s rejoining has sparked speculation on social media about Travis Kelce’s replacement

Kansas City Chiefs have signed tight end Jody Fortson off their practice squad. Fortson rejoined the Chiefs last week after spending the offseason and training camp with the Dolphins. He has not appeared in a regular season game since 2022 but has been with the Chiefs since 2019 before signing with Miami in free agency in March. In 19 career games, Fortson has 14 receptions for 155 yards and four touchdowns.Also Read: Billy Shaw, Pro Football Hall of Famer and Buffalo Bills great dies at 85 leaving a lasting legacy The Kansas City Chiefs have added Jody Fortson to their active roster, following his undrafted free agent status in 2019.Fortson played for the Chiefs in the 2021 and 2022 NFL seasons. He signed a $1.125 million deal with the Miami Dolphins but was released in August. The addition of Fortson has sparked speculation on social media about Travis Kelce, who has not been productive this season, and whether Fortson is Kelce's replacement.""Travis playing so bad they gotta active Jody fortson"", said one fan. ""Travis Kelce's career is over"", added another. ""How much help does Mahomes need?"", added another. ""He’ll somehow end up with 5 for 80"", said one fan while projecting Fortson's production. Kelce, despite a slow start, played a crucial role for the Chiefs in Week 4's win against the Los Angeles Chargers, completing seven receptions for 89 yards on nine targets. With injured Rashee Rice, Kelce will be utilized more, with Fortson potentially taking on the blocking role.Fortson signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2019. He was waived in August 2019 and signed to the practice squad. Fortson remained on the practice squad until the Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV. He resigned in February 2020, was waived in September 2020, and signed to the practice squad. He resigned in February 2021 and was added to the Chiefs' active roster in August 2021.Jody Fortson has played 19 games for the team, averaging 14 receptions for 155 yards and four touchdowns. With injured wide receivers, the Chiefs will heavily rely on running the ball and tight ends. Fortson, Kelce, and Noah Gray will play a significant role in the coming weeks. The presence of three tight ends will open up the field for wideouts like Xavier Worthy and help the Chiefs' running game, led by Kareem Hunt. The Chiefs are 4-0 heading into Week 5.Also Read: “A good frame job for a little 15 seconds of fame”: Mason Rudolph has cleared the air on a viral direct message exchange with Amanda Vance Read: How tall is Travis Kelce?","Kansas City Chiefs have signed tight end Jody Fortson off their practice squad.

Jets' Secondary Struggles Under Referee Scrutiny

Aaron Rodgers Sets NFL Milestone Despite Woes

The New York Jets and the Minnesota Vikings started the NFL's London Series at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday morning. The Jets, led by Aaron Rodgers , experienced an early very challenging period, especially when they faced two interceptions in the first half. In addition, the match was also adversely affected by quite many penalties for the Jets, which did not come in handy at all since their game was not on the roll when the first two quarters were over.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest The Jets accumulated five penalties in the first half, three of which came against cornerback Sauce Gardner. It meant that their defense could not have much control without the draw of flags, contributing to other problems they faced in the first half. The users on social media X echoed their frustrations by placing blame on the officiating crew from the NFL for having so many penalties; they thought it distorted the rhythm of the game.Many fans were whining about the whistles of the referees, labelling some of the penalty calls on the Jets' secondary asor at leastSome even wondered if Justin Jefferson of the Minnesota Vikings wasn't flagged for offensive pass interference when he often pushed off defenders. One fan complained sarcastically that it looked like the soccer referees were officiating the game.Criticism is coming from Jets fans who are calling on the NFL to re-examine the performance of the officials, indicating that it's becoming quite impossible for the Jets' defensive backs to make plays in light of the referees making things so tight.One of the first-half woes for the Jets was as Aaron Rodgers continued his quest for an extraordinary NFL milestone - this time reaching the 60,000-career passing yard mark. Dealing with knee inflammation all week, Rodgers moved to that milestone by completing a seven-yard pass to tight end Tyler Conklin on the opening drive of the second half. He is now the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach the mark, one after Matt Ryan, who made it there in 2022.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","The New York Jets and the Minnesota Vikings started the NFL's London Series at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday morning.

Exploding Pagers: How Israel’s Mossad convinced Hezbollah to buy its exploding pagers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-mossad-convinced-hezbollah-to-buy-its-exploding-pagers/articleshow/113980318.cms,"In a covert operation by Israel's Mossad , Hezbollah was convinced to purchase and distribute pagers to thousands of its operatives. The scheme was designed to infiltrate the group's communication system, ultimately leading to the deaths and injuries of many members.The story began two years ago when Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.The device in question, the AR924 pager , appeared to be an ideal tool for a militia group like Hezbollah. It was rugged, waterproof, and came with an oversized battery capable of lasting months without needing a recharge. The pagers were marketed as being immune to Israeli tracking, which appealed greatly to Hezbollah’s leaders, who were always wary of Israeli intelligence monitoring their communications.Follow: Live updates on Israel Hezbollah war In early 2023, Hezbollah made a bulk purchase of these pagers, convinced of their reliability. The devices were distributed to mid-level fighters and support personnel across Lebanon and Syria . What Hezbollah didn’t realise was that Mossad had designed the pagers themselves. Hidden within the battery pack of each device was a powerful explosive, which could be triggered remotely by Mossad or activated through a two-step process. The latter option involved pressing two buttons to decrypt messages, meaning the user would likely be holding the device with both hands when it detonated.On September 17, thousands of these pagers exploded simultaneously, killing or maiming an estimated 3,000 Hezbollah officers, fighters, and civilians. The operation is considered one of the most audacious and effective pieces of spycraft in recent history.Read more: How Israel's Mossad turned everyday pagers into deadly weapons against Hezbollah The plan originated in 2022 when Mossad, tasked with combating foreign threats to Israel, sought new ways to infiltrate Hezbollah, which had grown increasingly sophisticated in its communications.The organisation was desperate to avoid Israeli surveillance, and Mossad capitalised on this paranoia by offering Hezbollah what seemed to be secure, untraceable communication devices.To ensure the plan’s success, Mossad had to conceal the origins of the pagers. The devices were branded as Taiwanese and sold through a marketing official who had no knowledge of the true intent behind the sales. Hezbollah had been successfully misled into buying and distributing what were essentially bombs designed by their enemy.The first part of Mossad's pager plot was triggered on September 17. Explosions occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and Syria as Hezbollah operatives attempted to access encrypted messages. The two-step decryption process, which required both hands, ensured maximum casualties as fighters were directly exposed to the blasts. A day later, Mossad remotely triggered walkie-talkies that had been similarly booby-trapped, further adding to the chaos.This operation resulted in devastating consequences for Hezbollah, severely damaging its leadership and disrupting its communication networks. Israel followed up with airstrikes on Hezbollah’s key military infrastructure, intensifying the group's vulnerability. Despite the success of this operation, it also led to heightened tensions in the region, with Hezbollah and its backers, including Iran, retaliating and threatening further escalation.The attack is seen as a turning point in Israel’s ongoing conflict with Hezbollah, demonstrating the lengths Mossad is willing to go to neutralise threats and highlighting the profound risks of modern spycraft.","Israel's Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.

Passengers were forced to endure nearly an hour of inappropriate content before the crew switched to a more suitable film.Another passenger said, “How is this acceptable for a major airline? Has anyone else had something like this happen?”A Qantas spokesperson confirmed the incident, saying, “The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience.” The spokesperson explained that when it became evident that the film was inappropriate, the crew attempted to rectify the situation. However, when this proved impossible, they changed all screens to a family-friendly movie , which is standard practice when individual selection is unavailable.The airline is now reviewing its process for movie selection to prevent such incidents in the future.","Passengers aboard a recent Qantas flight from Sydney to Tokyo were left in disbelief when an inappropriate movie featuring explicit content was played on every screen.

A Canadian author shared a shocking revelation in her poignant memoir, ""A Widow's Guide to Dead Ba****ds,"" which she uncovered about her late husband Sean's secret life following his death in 2015 and what she did after that shocked the entire nation.In her book, writer Jessica Waite , while attempting to find the contact information for the Houston hospital where his body was being held, stumbled upon her husband's browsing history on his iPad, which included searches for "" Houston escorts ,"" their prices, and locations, New York Post reported.As Waite delved deeper into her husband's hidden world, she discovered that his deception extended far beyond a few encounters with escorts.Over the course of several months, she learned that Sean had been regularly cheating on her with multiple women and had even rented an apartment in Colorado to facilitate his extramarital affairs .Moreover, he had lied about working late on numerous occasions, instead using that time to download and categorise hundreds of explicit pornographic videos on his personal computer.Overwhelmed by the extent of her husband's betrayals, Waite found herself grappling with the harsh reality of his double life.After finding this she did something which no one had expected. In a moment of despair and detachment, she cut open the bag containing his ashes and mixed some of them into her dog's feces in the garden.“I’ve desecrated the remains of my partner in life,” Waite wrote.“But then, in despair and guilt, took more of his ashes — and actually ate them. The remains feel dry against my fingertips, coarser than baking powder, grainier than salt. They mix with the teary water, a mineral mud on the back of my tongue. I swallow.”Despite having found a new partner, Waite admits that the pain and sense of loss caused by her late husband's duplicity continue to affect her daily.""I feel better and stronger than before, but I still cry almost every day, and I still feel like a part of me has died,"" Waite wrote.

It was meant to be a surprise for Charles, but it became a shock to him, as Charles, according to the writer, did not approve of the princess dancing in a slinky gown without stockings.""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Anne told Fox News. Charles' three-word reaction was ""well done, darling."" That was it. He immediately went on to do something else. ""And when you've come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping … you just want somebody to tell you that you're doing all right.""The episode is not unknown. The Season 4 of the Crown on Netflix showed the dance routine and its aftermath.Anne Allan explained that there might be two reasons for Charles' displeasure. One, he's probably not a man who likes surprises; and two, probably he did not like his wife wearing a slinky dress, showing her body. "" I’m not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""But all that Diana was hoping was to light spark in their marriage.""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that’s what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""""I think she was much more able to see possibility of how romance should be. I’m not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""The performance was kept under the wrap till the last moment.""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That’s what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, ‘I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don’t want to make things difficult.’""Princess Diana and Anne eventually developed a friendship, and Diana would frequently seek Anne's counsel. In the book, Diana is quoted expressing her distress over her husband’s affair, saying, ""I know he's seeing Camilla again. Why doesn't he love me? I just can't understand.""""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don’t always agree. There’s no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can’t keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It’s not at all what I want. I’d like the marriage to work, but it just isn’t for now. Do I just put up with it, hoping he will change?""","Princess Diana's ballet teacher, Anne Allan, has written a book'Dancing with Diana ', where she explains an early sign of the doomed marriage.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"
