Redefining luxury at Monaco Grand Prix 2025

The 2025 Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix weekend was a dazzling blend of racing, music, art, and luxury. As McLaren’s Lando Norris took his maiden victory on the iconic Monte Carlo circuit, the event became much more than just a race. Celebrities and elite guests including Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, Dua Lipa, Sofia Vergara, and Odell Beckham Jr. turned Monaco into the ultimate playground of glitz and glamour. From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race. Robin Thicke opened with a private concert, followed by a surprise Sunday night set from DJ Rampa, who premiered new speakers to an electrified crowd including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.Created by Ben Biscotti and Sylvain Bitton, RD Grand Prix was designed to mix tech billionaires, royalty, and fashion icons with racing fans in a setting of unrivaled luxury. Guests enjoyed champagne on the rooftop bar, relaxed in an outdoor hot tub, shopped fashion pop-ups, and dined on cuisine by Michelin-starred chef Marc Forgione. Sponsors like RUMOR Rosé and Lewis Hamilton’s Almave spirit added to the upscale vibe. Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht. This event combined music, art, and philanthropy in an intimate, lively atmosphere. Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin. Leclerc mingled with fans as Ferrari’s signature red branding adorned the club in celebration of Nikki Beach’s 10th anniversary.This collaboration added a fashionable edge to the Grand Prix festivities and highlighted how Monaco continues to blend sport with luxury lifestyle in unique ways.The Monaco Grand Prix has always been synonymous with luxury and exclusivity, but this year’s events took it to new heights. From Jeff Bezos’ star-studded yacht party to Odell Beckham Jr.’s fusion of art and philanthropy, and Charles Leclerc’s stylish launch, Monaco 2025 was about more than racing.

GTA 6: Key gameplay leaks



GTA 6: Upgraded map



GTA 6: More speculated features



While Rockstar Games maintains a tight lid on information surrounding the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, a new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online, offering more details about the game's gameplay mechanics, expansive map, and various content elements. The leaks suggest that GTA 6 will feature over 700 enterable stores, functional malls, and a revamped character-switching system. Rockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 will launch on May 26, 2026, for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though a PC release date remains unannounced.According to reports from various gaming news outlets and social media discussions, these recent leaks suggest several intriguing gameplay additions. Among them is the purported return of a 6-star wanted level, a fan-favourite feature from previous GTA instalments. The ""relationship bar,"" previously hinted at in leaked 2022 clips and said to function akin to the ""honour"" system in Red Dead Redemption 2, also reportedly still exists.New elements include weight mechanics and explorable underwater areas brimming with treasure and secrets. The leak also claims that the scene from Trailer 2 where Jason buys beer is actual gameplay, hinting at enhanced environmental interaction. The ""greet and antagonise"" system, seen in Red Dead Redemption 2, is also rumoured to be integrated.A significant detail suggests a revamped character wheel with three options: playing as Solo Jason, Solo Lucia, or a Dual protagonist control mode allowing simultaneous control of both characters for open-world robberies and specific missions.The leaks indicate that GTA 6’s map will not feature a Panhandle, contradicting previous speculation. However, the game will still include a vast open world, with Vice City at its core and additional locations inspired by Florida’s diverse landscapes.While a ""Disney World parody"" is reportedly not included, fans are dissecting every pixel of the existing trailers and unconfirmed data to piece together the full scope of Vice City and its surrounding areas, including Ambrosia and Port Gellhorn.Further alleged content details include the presence of male strippers, an assertion that the driving mechanics are the ""best it's ever been,"" and gore/dismemberment built upon Red Dead Redemption 2's system. However, some rumoured features from earlier leaks, such as fully nude sex scenes, listening to music outside of a car, prone movement, and dual-wielding weapons, are now claimed to have been cut. The story is reportedly structured into five chapters, similar to Red Dead Redemption 2.","A new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online.

If you're stuck or just curious about today's puzzle solution, keep reading to find all the details you need to crack the grid for June 11, 2025.Connections is a daily puzzle game from The New York Times. It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 words. The challenge is to group these words into four sets of four based on a shared theme or category. These connections might be obvious or require some creative thinking. Categories can range from types of animals to famous characters or grammatical symbols. Only one correct solution exists for each puzzle and players must avoid making too many wrong guesses. It’s a game that rewards observation and lateral thinking.To play NYT Connections, look at the grid of 16 words and try to form four groups of four words that are related in some way. When you think you’ve found the correct group, select those four words and submit your answer. If it’s correct, the group will disappear. If it’s not, you lose one of your four chances. Some words may appear to belong in more than one group, so it’s important to think carefully. The difficulty level increases across colour categories. Yellow is the easiest group, green and blue are intermediate, and purple is often the most challenging. The game resets every day at midnight with a new puzzle.And here are some helpful hints for each group:Yellow group — boast: BLUSTER, CROW, SHOW OFF, STRUTGreen group — arc-shaped things: BANANA, EYEBROW, FLIGHT PATH, RAINBOWBlue group — cereal mascots: COUNT, ELVES, LEPRECHAUN, ROOSTERPurple group — ways to denote a citation: ASTERISK, DAGGER, NUMBER, PARENSThe yellow category was all about expressions of pride or arrogance. Words like BLUSTER, CROW, SHOW OFF, and STRUT captured different ways people boast or act superior.In the green group, the theme was curved shapes. Items such as BANANA, EYEBROW, FLIGHT PATH, and RAINBOW were included for their characteristic arc-like form.The blue set brought together cereal mascots. COUNT represents Count Chocula, ELVES are the faces of Rice Krispies, LEPRECHAUN stands for Lucky Charms, and ROOSTER refers to the Kellogg’s Corn Flakes mascot.The purple group highlighted text citation symbols. ASTERISK, DAGGER, NUMBER, and PARENS are all commonly used to point readers to footnotes or additional context in writing.Today’s Connections puzzle offered a nice balance of clear and clever groupings. While the mascots might have challenged some players, the citation theme added a thoughtful twist. Whether you breezed through or leaned on a hint, it was another entertaining brain workout.

Packed with promises to be one of the biggest WWDC conferences so far, Apple is expected to introduce the most awaited iOS 26 , the future mobile operating system for iPhones. According to reports by BGR, the keynote is speculated to highlight breakthrough developments that not only improves the user experience but will also be compatible with artificial intelligence, has fluidity between cross-devices, and has a more intelligent design philosophy.Even though Apple has not publicly announced all the features, the leaks and rumors within the industry indicate a bright outlook. With AI-driven health recommendations to live translation through AirPods, iOS 26 will embark on a new path in making the iPhone smarter, smarter, and more personal.Listed below are the rumoured iOS 26 features that could completely transform your iPhone.One of the largest issues with beta software over the past few years has been instability during initial releases. Apple is said to be focusing heavily on foundational performance boosts and more refined beta testing cycles with iOS 26. This translates to fewer bugs, improved resource efficiency, and a cleaner experience across models.iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro. The new design is speculated to come with translucent features, more simplified menus, and a less prominent interface.Over the years, the Camera app has become a bit troublesome with a lot of toggles and buried options. With iOS 26, Apple can finally simplify this interface, providing a more smooth and distraction-free shooting experience.Fitness and health have been at the heart of Apple's world, but iOS 26 might take it to the next level with the launch of an AI health coach. This would take user information from the Health app and Apple Watch and create personalized fitness and wellness advice.Battery life remains a priority for iPhone users. Apple can solve this with AI-driven battery optimisation, where the operating system learns user habits and optimizes background activity accordingly.Accessing public Wi-Fi, particularly captive networks that demand login screens, can become a chore. iOS 26 might bring a shared login feature that is synced across devices with the same Apple ID.Perhaps the most awaited feature is real-time translation support in AirPods, which would possibly be driven by Apple Intelligence (Apple's own AI suite).From an improved battery life to smarter health tracking and real-time translation, the upcoming iOS 26 features seem aimed at making the iPhone not just a device, but a more intuitive extension of daily life. Stay tuned for Apple’s keynote, where all eyes will be on how many of these speculations actually become reality.","iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro.

Which WWE superstar revealed fans crossing their personal boundaries?



“I appreciate fans wanting to send fan mail, and I love receiving it but PLEASE stop sending mail to my parent’s home. All letters and packages should be sent to the performance center in Orlando only. All the stuff they receive I tell them to throw away. Thank uuu🖤”





A top prospect in WWE reveals that fans are not respecting her personal boundaries.The life of a WWE superstar comes with its fair share of highs and lows. Their character presentation, larger-than-life personas, and amazing in-ring athleticism make them an inspiration for fans watching all over the world. However, there is a certain section of fans who fail to understand that the superstars have their own personal space as well, which is not to be violated. A recent incident came to light, as revealed by one of the top prospects in WWE today.Current WWE NXT superstar, Izzy Dame, took to her X to reveal that fans have been sending a lot of mail to her parents' home. While she appreciated the sentiment, Dame made it clear that it was not right and asked them to stop doing that, as it would ultimately be thrown away. However, she did tell them that they can send all fan mail to the WWE Performance Center.She tweeted,Such incidents have been reported in the past, with the last name being former WWE NXT star, Cora Jade, who also requested the fans not to send anything to her home.On the other hand, a lot of messages sent to Izzy Dame surely hint at her rising popularity in NXT. She has been a top star in the making in the Black and Grey brand, and currently is a member of the Culling faction. Moreover, she has competed in various top showdowns during her tenure in NXT.As she continues to climb the ladder. Dame's fan base continues to grow.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability.

What is a CIBIL score?

How to get your CIBIL Credit score without a PAN Card

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans. Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

What is AI and how it works?



What are large language models (LLMs) and how are they trained?



How is AI helpful for people?



What is Agentic AI?



What is AGI?



Will AI take away our jobs and what people can do?



The tech world is changing fast, and it's all thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI). We're seeing amazing breakthroughs, from chatbots that can chat like a human to phones that are getting incredibly smart. This shift is making us ask bigger questions. It's no longer just about ""what can AI do right now?"" but more about ""what will AI become, and how will it affect our lives?""First, we got used to helpful chatbots. Then, the idea of a ""super smart"" AI, called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), started taking over headlines. Companies like Google , Microsoft , and OpenAI are all working hard to make AGI a reality. But even before AGI gets here, the tech world is buzzing about Agentic AI .With all these new terms and fast changes, it's easy for most of us who aren't deep in the tech world to feel a bit lost. If you're wondering what all this means for you, you're in the right place. In this simple guide, we'll answer your most important questions about the world of AI, helping you understand what's happening now and get ready for what's next.In the simplest terms, AI is about making machines – whether it's smartphones or laptops – smart. It's a field of computer science that creates systems capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. Think of it as teaching computers to ""think"" or ""learn"" in a way that mimics how humans do. This task can include understanding human language, recognising patterns and even learning from experience.It uses its training -- just like humans -- in achieving its goal which is to solve problems and make decisions. That brings us to our next query: ""How is a machine trained to do tasks like humans?""While AI might seem like magic, it works on a few core principles. Just like humans get their information from observing, reading, listening and other sources, AI systems utilise vast amounts of data, including text, images, sounds, numbers and more.As mentioned above, AI systems need to learn and for that, they utilise Large Language Models, or LLMs. They are highly advanced AI programmes specifically designed to understand, generate and interact with human language. Think of them as incredibly knowledgeable digital brains that specialise in certain fields.LLMs are trained on enormous amounts of text data – billions and even trillions of words from books, articles, websites, conversations and more. This vast exposure allows them to learn the nuances of human language like grammar, context, facts and even different writing styles.For example, an LLM is like a teacher that has a vast amount of knowledge and understands complex questions as well as can reason through them to provide relevant answers. The teacher provides the core knowledge and framework. Chatbots then utilise this ""teacher"" (the LLM) to interact with users. The chatbot is the ""student"" or ""interface"" that applies the teacher's lessons.This means AI is really good at specific tasks, like playing chess or giving directions, but it can't do other things beyond its programmed scope.AI is getting deeply integrated into our daily lives, making things easier, faster and smarter. For example, it can be used in powering voice assistants that can answer questions in seconds, or in healthcare where doctors can ask AI to analyse medical images (like X-rays for early disease detection) in seconds and help patients in a more effective manner, or help in drug discovery.It aims to make people efficient by allowing them to delegate some work to AI and helping them in focusing on major problems.At its core, Agentic AI focuses on creating AI agents – intelligent software programmes that can gather information, process it for reasoning, execute the ideas by taking decisions and even learn and adapt by evaluating their outcomes.For example, a chatbot is a script: ""If a customer asks X, reply Y.""A Generative AI (LLM) is like a brilliant essay writer: ""Give it a topic, and it'll write an essay.""Agentic AI is like a project manager: ""My goal is to plan and execute a marketing campaign."" It can then break down the goal, generate ideas, write emails, schedule meetings, analyse data and adjust its plan – all with minimal human oversight – Just like JARVIS in Iron Man and Avengers movies.AGI is a hypothetical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of intellectual tasks at a level comparable to, or surpassing, that of a human being. Think of AGI as a brilliant human polymath – someone who can master any subject, solve any problem and adapt to any challenge across various fields.While AI agents are created to take up specific tasks in which they learn and execute, AGI will be like a ‘ Super AI Agent ’ that virtually has all the information there is in this world and can solve problems on any subject.There is a straightforward answer by various tech CEOs and executives across the industry: Yes. AI will take away repetitive, predictable tasks and extensive data processing, such as data entry, routine customer service, assembly line operations, basic accounting and certain analytical roles.While this means some existing positions may be displaced, AI will more broadly transform roles, augmenting human capabilities and shifting the focus towards tasks requiring creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence and strategic oversight. For example, AI/Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists , Prompt Engineers and more.The last such revolution came with the internet and computers which did eat some jobs but created so many more roles for people. They can skill themselves by enrolling in new AI-centric courses to learn more about the booming technology to be better placed in the future.","AI is getting deeply integrated into our daily lives, making things easier, faster and smarter.

Starbucks to use AI to cut wait time and make service faster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/starbucks-to-use-ai-to-cut-wait-time-and-make-service-faster/articleshow/121781077.cms,"Apple's HUGE iPhone makeover: iOS 26 & Liquid Glass Explained!

Starbucks is introducing a new AI assistant called Green Dot Assist at 35 stores this month to help baristas work faster and more efficiently. According to a CNBC report, the assistant is built using Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI platform and is part of the company’s plan to improve service and reduce wait times at its cafés. The AI tool was unveiled during Starbucks’ Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas, where over 14,000 North American store managers gathered. A full rollout across U.S. and Canadian stores is expected in fiscal year 2026, starting this fall.“It’s just another example of how innovation technology is coming into service of our partners and making sure that we’re doing all we can to simplify the operations, make their jobs just a little bit easier, maybe a little bit more fun, so that they can do what they do best,” Starbucks Chief Technology Officer Deb Hall Lefevre told the publication.Helping Baristas work smarterGreen Dot Assist will be available on a tablet behind the counter, allowing baristas to type or speak their questions in plain language. Instead of looking through manuals or online guides, staff can now quickly find answers about drink recipes, fixing equipment, and more.Future plans for the AI include automatically reporting tech issues and suggesting schedule changes when an employee is absent. These upgrades aim to support Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol’s goal of reducing service times to under four minutes per order.Starbucks’ partnership with Microsoft comes at a time when many companies, like Walmart and JPMorgan, are adopting generative AI to improve operations and reduce costs. However, AI tools can sometimes provide wrong answers — a problem known as “hallucinations.” Lefevre said Starbucks’ system is designed with safeguards to ensure the information it gives is accurate.Other upgrades shown at the event included a new point-of-sale system and improved espresso machines. According to Lefevre, even experienced baristas are learning to use the new system in under an hour. It can also suggest repeat orders for loyal customers, helping Starbucks bring back a more personal experience in its stores.","Green Dot Assist will be available on a tablet behind the counter, allowing baristas to type or speak their questions in plain language.

[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 & Grounded 2 Direct

Microsoft just wrapped up their biggest gaming showcase of the year, and honestly? They came loaded for bear. From brand new handhelds to surprise Final Fantasy drops, this wasn't your typical ""here's what's coming eventually"" presentation. The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.The show's theme was clear: Xbox wants to be everywhere you are, whether that's your couch, your desk, or apparently now in your backpack. With every announced game supporting Xbox Play Anywhere and a shiny new handheld to show off, Microsoft is doubling down on their ""play anywhere"" philosophy in a big way.Let's break down everything that happened during this gaming extravaganza.The biggest hardware surprise came courtesy of Microsoft's partnership with Asus. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X aren't just another Steam Deck competitor, they’re Microsoft's direct answer to handheld PC gaming. Both the Ally(s) run full Windows, meaning you can access Xbox Game Pass, Steam, Battle.net, and pretty much any PC storefront you can think of.The regular Ally packs an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, while the Ally X steps things up with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme, 24GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage. Both launch this holiday season, and Microsoft made sure to mention that every game shown in the showcase will run on these handhelds. That's a bold claim, but if it holds true, these could be game-changers for portable gaming.After years of waiting, Obsidian's space RPG sequel has locked in October 29, 2025 as its launch date. The new trailer showed off the colony of Arcadia, which looks like it's having a significantly worse time than the locations in the first game. Rifts are tearing through space-time, factions are at each other's throats, and somehow capitalism is still the real villain.The sequel promises bigger RPG systems, more reactive storytelling, and full character customisation. Plus, there's an expanded Direct happening right after the showcase, so Obsidian clearly has a lot more to show. If you enjoyed the original's blend of dark humour and corporate satire, this looks like more of exactly what you want.October 21, 2025 marks the return of one of gaming's most brutally difficult action series. Ninja Gaiden 4 is a collaboration between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, which sounds like a recipe for some absolutely bonkers combat sequences. The trailer showcased new protagonist Yakumo pulling off impossible combos against hordes of enemies, with the signature weapon-switching and aerial juggling the series is known for.The game is set in near-future Tokyo, features connections to series legend Ryu Hayabusa, and promises to deliver that ""git gud or go home"" difficulty the franchise built its reputation on. If you've been missing proper character action games, this one's shaping up to be essential.Sometimes the most unexpected announcements hit the hardest, and Super Meat Boy 3D definitely qualifies. Sluggerfly and Headup Games are taking Team Meat's masochistic masterpiece and literally adding another dimension to the suffering. The early 2026 release promises all the wall-jumping, buzzsaw-dodging, death-filled gameplay that made the original a cult classic, except now you can fail spectacularly in three dimensions instead of two.The trailer showcased the same tight platforming mechanics that turned controllers into projectiles worldwide, complete with Meat Boy's quest to rescue his bandage-wrapped girlfriend from that eternally creepy fetus in a jar. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously hitting ""retry"" for the 500th time – and honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way.InXile's ambitious RPG got an extended look, and it's looking appropriately ambitious. Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, players discover that history itself has been manipulated by the city's ruler. Your solution? A time travel device that lets you hop into the past and change things, with consequences rippling forward into the present.The new trailer focused on the grittier side of Avalon, showing the downtrodden areas where gangs prey on the weak. It's a far cry from the polished upper city areas we've seen before, suggesting the game will have some real social commentary alongside its time-bending mechanics. No release date yet, but this is definitely one to watch.The final reveal of the show was perhaps the biggest surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, set in 2035. This isn't your typical modern warfare setup; the trailer suggested heavy sci-fi elements, psychological warfare, and the return of David Mason from Black Ops 2. The year 2035 apparently isn't going great for humanity, with the world ""on the brink of chaos"" following the events of previous Black Ops games.Treyarch and Raven Software are promising co-op campaign support, near-future weaponry, and the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies. The official reveal is coming this summer, but this teaser suggests the series is taking some big swings with its setting and tone.Sometimes the best announcements are the ones you can play immediately. Gears of War: Reloaded launches August 26, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can jump into a multiplayer beta starting June 13. This definitive edition of the original Gears features 4K textures, 60 FPS campaign, 120 FPS multiplayer, and full cross-play support.The remaster is coming to more platforms than any Gears game before it, including PlayStation 5. It's a smart move from Microsoft, using one of their biggest exclusives to showcase their multi-platform strategy while giving longtime fans the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.Obsidian's surprise sequel announcement came with an immediate Early Access date, July 29, 2025. Grounded 2 moves the action from a single backyard to the larger Brookhollow Park, featuring new biomes, new bugs, and one of the community's most requested features: rideable vehicles called Buggies.The game promises major quality-of-life improvements over the original, including an all-in-one Omni-Tool that should streamline the building and crafting systems. With over 25 million players shaping the first game's development, this sequel feels like a direct response to community feedback.In the showcase's biggest surprise drop, Final Fantasy XVI is available on Xbox platforms right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. The game that many considered a permanent PlayStation exclusive just became part of Xbox's catalog, complete with Xbox Play Anywhere support and cross-save functionality.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is following this winter, meaning Xbox players will soon have access to some of the most acclaimed JRPGs of recent years. Microsoft made sure to point out that every mainline single-player Final Fantasy is now playable on Xbox platforms, which is a pretty impressive collection to have.Three RPGs caught attention for their unique approaches to familiar genres. Aniimo is an open-world creature collecting game that lets players actually transform into the creatures they capture through something called the Twining system. It's hitting 2026 with a closed beta coming later this year.Aphelion from Don't Nod (Life is Strange, Jusant) is a sci-fi adventure about an astronaut stranded on a frozen planet. What makes it special is its partnership with the European Space Agency, promising gameplay grounded in real science. Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak takes players to post-apocalyptic Japan with a cursed protagonist and her loyal dog companion fighting massive creatures.All three games are coming in 2026.Quarter Up announced Invincible VS , a 3v3 tag fighter based on the hit comic and animated series. The trailer showed appropriately brutal superhero combat with characters like Mark, Thula, and Atom Eve beating the absolute stuffing out of each other. It's coming in 2026 and looks like it could scratch that Marvel vs. Capcom itch.Mudang: Two Hearts is a tactical action game set in a reunified Korea, following a North Korean operative and a K-pop idol whose paths cross during terrorist attacks. The cinematic presentation and Unreal Engine 5 visuals make it one to watch for 2026.Persona 4 Revival got the briefest of teases, literally about seven seconds of footage, but it's enough to confirm that Atlus is giving the beloved JRPG a full remake treatment. No release date yet, but seeing those updated visuals of Inaba was enough to get fans excited.Three major Xbox exclusives are getting substantial content drops. The Elder Scrolls Online is continuing its Worm Cult storyline with new content arriving June 18. Fallout 76 added fishing with the Gone Fission update, because apparently even post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers need to relax sometimes.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting The Order of Giants DLC on September 4, taking Indy beneath the streets of Rome for a new adventure.The most anticipated indie game of the decade got its briefest of mentions, but sometimes that's all you need to send a fanbase into overdrive. Hollow Knight: Silksong appeared during the ROG Xbox Ally segment with a simple promise: it'll be available ""at launch and in Game Pass"" when the handheld arrives later this year. No new footage, no release date, just the confirmation that Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel is still breathing.The game's developer quickly clarified that Silksong isn't tied to the console's release and will arrive ""before Holiday,"" which has fans cautiously optimistic that Christmas 2025 might finally deliver the Metroidvania sequel they've been waiting years for. After countless delays and radio silence, even this tiny update feels like a victory for the Silksong faithful who've been subsisting on hope and memes for far too long.Phil Spencer closed the show by looking ahead to 2026 and Xbox's 25th anniversary. The confirmed lineup includes a new Fable, the next Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and what Spencer called ""the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning."" Most fans are interpreting that last tease as Halo-related, possibly a Combat Evolved remake or remaster.It's a strong lineup for Xbox's quarter-century celebration, mixing beloved franchises with what sounds like a major nostalgic announcement. Whether it's Halo or something else entirely, Spencer clearly saved the biggest tease for last.","The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.

What went wrong with Siri: Apple's Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak explain why the ‘new’ Siri ‘just don’t work’ like an Apple product,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-went-wrong-with-siri-apples-craig-federighi-and-greg-joswiak-explain-why-the-new-siri-just-dont-work-like-an-apple-product/articleshow/121775527.cms,"Apple's quality standards override deadlines

Two architectures, one solution

Apple's different AI strategy

Apple's software chief Craig Federighi has offered the most detailed explanation yet for why the company's highly anticipated AI-powered Siri features, first promised at WWDC 2024, have been delayed until 2026. In a series of post-keynote interviews, Federighi admitted that Apple's initial approach ""just doesn't work reliably enough to be an Apple product.""The delay represents a rare misstep for Apple, which typically avoids demonstrating features it cannot deliver on schedule. Federighi revealed that while Apple had working prototypes of the enhanced Siri capabilities, including personal context awareness and cross-app functionality, the features only performed correctly about two-thirds of the time.""This just doesn't work reliably enough to be an Apple product,"" Federighi told The Wall Street Journal, providing his most candid assessment of the situation. In the same WSJ interview, he reiterated the technical challenges: ""We found that when we were developing this feature that we had, really, two phases, two versions of the ultimate architecture that we were going to create.""Speaking to TechRadar and Tom's Guide in a joint podcast interview, Federighi expanded on the architectural problems: ""We realized that V1 architecture, we could push and push and put in more time, but if we tried to push that out in the state it was going to be in, it would not meet our customer expectations or Apple standards.""The admission marks an unusual moment of transparency from Apple, which has faced mounting pressure to compete with AI-powered assistants from Google and OpenAI . Federighi stressed that the company prioritized product quality over meeting artificial deadlines, even as competitors advance their AI capabilities.""Look, we don't want to disappoint customers,"" said Greg Joswiak , Apple's marketing chief, in the Wall Street Journal interview. ""We never do. But it would've been more disappointing to ship something that didn't hit our quality standard, that had an error rate that we felt was unacceptable. So we made what we thought was the best decision. I'd make it again.""Federighi echoed this sentiment in his conversation with YouTuber iJustine , explaining: ""What we said a while ago was that we were really working hard to get those [features] to come together. [We] had them working internally, but not working well enough."" He emphasized the critical importance of reliability: ""You know, when you have an experience like asking Siri to do something, either it becomes something you can depend on reliably, or it's something in the end you're not going to use.""The delayed features were meant to transform Siri into a more capable assistant that could understand personal context, operate across multiple apps, and perform complex tasks based on on-screen content. Apple demonstrated these capabilities at WWDC 2024, showing Siri finding podcasts mentioned in messages and taking actions within apps using what Apple calls ""app intents.""However, Federighi revealed that Apple was simultaneously developing two different underlying architectures. While the company successfully demonstrated the ""V1 architecture"" at last year's conference, it became clear during development that this approach had fundamental limitations that prevented it from meeting Apple's reliability standards.""We were very focused on creating a broad platform for really integrated personal experiences into the OS,"" Federighi saud in the podcast, explaining Apple's original vision. But as development progressed, he noted: ""We set about for months, making it work better and better across more app intents, better and better for doing search, but fundamentally, we found that the limitations of the V1 architecture weren't getting us to the quality level that we knew our customers needed and expected.""In the Wall Street Journal interview, Federighi addressed why Apple, with all its resources, couldn't make the original approach work: ""When it comes to automating capabilities on devices in a reliable way, no one's doing it really well right now. We wanted to be the first. We wanted to do it best.""""We set about for months, making it work better and better across more app intents, better and better for doing search,"" Federighi said. ""But fundamentally, we found that the limitations of the V1 architecture weren't getting us to the quality level that we knew our customers needed and expected.""The switch to what Federighi calls the ""V2 architecture"" effectively reset the development timeline. This deeper, more comprehensive approach extends across the entire Siri experience, building upon the work already completed rather than starting from scratch.""The V2 architecture is not, it wasn't a start-over,"" Federighi clarified in his TechRadar-Tom's Guide interview. ""The V1 architecture was sort of half of the V2 architecture, and now we extend it across, sort of make it a pure architecture that extends across the entire Siri experience.""During the company's spring assessment, Apple made the difficult decision to abandon the V1 approach. ""As soon as we realized that, and that was during the spring, we let the world know that we weren't going to be able to put that out, and we were going to keep working on really shifting to the new architecture,"" Federighi told the podcast.Apple's approach differs significantly from competitors like OpenAI and Google, who have released chatbot-style AI assistants that users access through dedicated apps. Instead, Apple aims to integrate intelligence throughout its ecosystem, meeting users ""where they are"" rather than requiring them to navigate to a separate AI interface.""When we started with Apple Intelligence, we were very clear: this wasn't about just building a chatbot,"" Federighi emphasized in the podcast. The company's strategy remains focused on embedding AI capabilities directly into existing apps and workflows, rather than creating a standalone conversational assistant.Joswiak reinforced this philosophy in the same podcast discussion: ""The features that you're seeing in Apple Intelligence isn't a destination for us. There's no app on intelligence. [It's about] making all the things you do every day better.""Federighi acknowledged the appeal of conversational AI but maintained Apple's different focus: ""I know a lot of people find it to be a really powerful way to gather their thoughts, brainstorm [...] So, sure, these are great things. Are they the most important thing for Apple to develop? Well, time will tell where we go there, but that's not the main thing we set out to do at this time.""While Apple won't commit to a specific timeline for the enhanced Siri features, Federighi made clear the company won't repeat its premature announcement mistake. ""We will announce the date when we're ready to seed it, and you're all ready to be able to experience it,"" he told the TechRadar-Tom's Guide podcast.Speaking with YouTuber iJustine, Federighi promised comprehensive delivery: ""We really look forward to releasing everything we talked about in the past, and more. We don't really want to commit to that until we have it in hand."" This suggests Apple may have additional Siri capabilities in development beyond what was originally demonstrated at WWDC 2024.","Apple's software chief Craig Federighi reveals Siri features will be delayed until 2026.

When software outpaces the hardware

The 20th anniversary iPhone: Where hardware meets Liquid Glass vision

It’s beyond mere aesthetics

There's something different about Apple 's new Liquid Glass design language in iOS 26 . While the translucent, fluid interface elements are undeniably beautiful, with their specular highlights and dynamic reflections, they feel strangely at odds with the flat, angular hardware they're meant to inhabit.The shift represents the company's third major design evolution since the original iPhone , moving from the real-world mimicry of skeuomorphism to the simplified geometry of flat design, and now to something entirely new. hat comes 12 years after the last major change, when Apple shifted from skeuomorphism to flat design in 2013.But, the current generation of iPhones, with their crisp edges and matte finishes, seems to clash with software that's all about curves, transparency, and organic flow.This disconnect isn't accidental. If anything, it's a preview of where Apple is heading, both in design philosophy and hardware evolution. The Liquid Glass interface feels like it belongs on a device that doesn't exist yet, one that matches its fluid aesthetic with equally fluid form factors. That device, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, is likely coming sooner than we think.Apple's design history is punctuated by moments when software vision preceded hardware capability. The original iPhone's skeuomorphic interface helped users transition from physical to digital interactions, while iOS 7's flat design coincided with the introduction of the Apple Watch and larger iPhone displays. Now, Liquid Glass appears to be setting the stage for another hardware change for Apple.The new design language, announced at WWDC 2025, extends across all of Apple's platforms, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26. It features translucent materials that ""reflect and refract their surroundings"" while ""dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content.""Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of Human Interface Design, described Liquid Glass as combining ""the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve."" The emphasis on real-time rendering and dynamic reactions to movement suggests Apple is preparing users for devices that are themselves more glass-like, more fluid in their physical construction.This hardware-software makes sense when viewed through the lens of Apple's development cycles, as they have repeatedly used interface design to telegraph future. Major interface overhauls typically precede significant hardware launches by 12 to 18 months, giving developers time to adapt and users time to acclimate for transitions that might otherwise feel jarring.The introduction of Dark Mode years before OLED displays became standard across the iPhone lineup is one example; the emphasis on curved corners in iOS design elements before the iPhone X's curved display is another. Looking back, the tinted icons and customization options Apple introduced last year were early hints of the Liquid Glass design language to come.Gurman's reporting reveals why Liquid Glass feels premature on current hardware: it's designed for the 2027 iPhone, internally codenamed ""Glasswing"" after the butterfly species with transparent wings. This 20th anniversary device promises to embody the Liquid Glass aesthetic in physical form, featuring ""curved glass sides around the entire phone, even at the edges"" with ""extraordinarily slim bezels and no cutout section in the screen.""The Glasswing concept suggests Apple is returning to the design language of the iPhone X, that pivotal 2017 device that introduced edge-to-edge displays and curved corners. The iPhone X felt revolutionary precisely because its hardware matched its software: the curved display corners perfectly complemented the rounded interface elements, while the all-glass construction reflected the translucent design elements on screen.Current iPhones, despite their technical prowess, lack this harmony. The flat edges introduced with the iPhone 12 series, while premium and distinctive, create a visual tension with Liquid Glass's organic curves and flowing animations. It's elegant software trapped in geometric hardware.Liquid Glass isn't just about visual appeal, it's a show of Apple's advancing graphics capabilities and silicon performance. The real-time rendering and dynamic light effects require considerable computational power, indicating Apple's chips can handle more sophisticated visual processing than current interfaces utilise.This technological capability is important for the Glasswing iPhone 's implementation. A device with curved glass surfaces and minimal bezels will need software that can adapt to different viewing angles and lighting conditions. Liquid Glass's emphasis on environmental adaptation, how interface elements respond to surrounding content and lighting, resembles a feature set for a phone designed to be viewed from multiple angles.The implications extend beyond phones. Apple's focus on cross-platform design consistency suggests Liquid Glass will influence products from the Apple Watch to future AR/VR devices. A design language built around transparency and environmental awareness appears well-suited for mixed reality applications, where virtual interfaces must integrate with physical environments.As Apple prepares to introduce iOS 26's Liquid Glass interface, users will experience a design philosophy that feels ahead of current hardware. This appears intentional. By the time the 20th anniversary iPhone arrives in 2027, Liquid Glass may feel less 'revolutionary' and more like a natural evolution of a design language that finally has appropriate hardware to support its vision.","Liquid Glass is Apple's new design language for iOS 26.
