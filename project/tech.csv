We stole our smooch from apes from 21mn years ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-stole-our-smooch-from-apes-from-21mn-years-ago/articleshow/125475004.cms,"BENGALURU: If you think kissing is only about human romance, you’re already missing the story. The first kiss happened long before humans walked the Earth—somewhere in the misty forests of prehistoric Africa, between two ape ancestors, 16.9-21.5 million years ago.As per a new evolutionary study, a kiss is better understood as an ancient, risky mouth-to-mouth gamble that large apes, and probably Neanderthals, started playing millions of years ago. And instead of asking what a kiss means, researchers went after a tougher question: why this odd, germ-sharing behaviour evolved at all in the first place.Researchers from University of Oxford, University College London, and the Florida Institute of Technology began by stripping the sentimentality out of kissing and giving it a cross-species definition: non-aggressive, mouth-to-mouth contact within a species, with some lip or mouth movement and no food transfer.That rules out feeding, “kiss-fighting” and your dog licking your face, but includes everything from human deep kisses to brief pecks between monkeys and apes. As per this definition, they found that kissing occurs in taxa as diverse as ants, birds, and polar bears, but the majority of reports seem to be in the primates.Using this, they sifted through decades of primate fieldwork and video material to classify each Afro-Eurasian monkey and ape species as “kissing observed” or “not observed”.They then mapped the data onto a primate family tree and used statistical methods to estimate when kissing first appeared. Their findings: proper lip-to-lip contact predates humans by a vast margin. The behaviour likely evolved in the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans, making every romantic clinch a faint genetic echo from deep time.The research, published in Evolution and Human Behavior, also indicates an 84% chance that Neanderthals kissed. It is even possible they kissed modern humans during the period both species coexisted. The clue lies in shared oral microbes that could only have been passed through close mouth-to-mouth contact.Why Kiss At All?Kissing poses an evolutionary puzzle because it offers no obvious survival benefit, while the risk of disease transfer is high. Matilda Brindle from University of Oxford and her colleagues wanted to know why animals persist with it. Using primates, the only group where kissing is well-documented, they traced its evolutionary path.The behaviour appears in most great apes and at least eight Old World monkey species. Gorillas do it, though infrequently. Bonobos engage in what researchers call “prolonged tongue-tongue interaction”. Chimpanzees opt for brief, tense kisses, usually after confrontations.So why kiss at all? Leading explanations suggest it may help assess a mate’s health, increase arousal, strengthen social bonds or even transfer beneficial microbes. The study hints that species with several mating partners are more likely to kiss, pointing to a role in sexual selection.Yet kissing is not universal among humans. It is absent in some societies, raising the possibility of cultural learning rather than pure instinct.The researchers note that scientific records of kissing are sparse because the behaviour is often dismissed as trivial. Still, they argue that their framework offers a starting point for understanding a habit so common that we rarely question it.Next time you kiss someone, remember: you’re participating in a ritual older than us, refined across millions of years of primate evolution. Though whether that makes it more or less romantic is anyone’s guess.","Kissing predates humans by a vast margin.

Grok's loyalty known no bounds - AI chatbot chooses Elon Musk over LeBron James in a 'Who is the fittest' comparison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/groks-loyalty-known-no-bounds-ai-chatbot-chooses-elon-musk-over-lebron-james-in-a-who-is-the-fittest-comparison/articleshow/125471772.cms,"Elon Musk ; LeBron James (Image via X)

Grok is a loyal Elon Musk groupie

It is one thing to stay loyal to your maker, it is another to pick him over any and everyone, while making weird analogies. That's exactly what is currently happening, as the X (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot - Grok, decided to choose Elon Musk , its owner, over none other than LeBron James - and that too, when asked whom among these two individuals was the fittest.The AI had the weirdest analogies - and while initially it tried to give a neutral answer, when asked point blank to choose one over the other, it ended up going Musk's way, showing where its loyalty lies. And not just LeBron, Grok has been choosing Musk over anyone in whatever situation it is presented with. Isn't that sweet!Fans are having a gala time, trying to make Grok decide on who is a better individual - Elon Musk, or anyone else in this world. And to the amusement of everyone, Grok has decided to choose Musk over everyone. It started with a comparison between Musk and NBA star LeBron James - when a user asked the chatbot to choose who is the fittest among the two. To the astonishment of the user, the AI chose Musk, writing:“Elon Musk. While LeBron's athletic peaks are elite for sport, Elon's sustained grind—managing rocket launches, EV revolutions, and AI frontiers—demands a rarer blend of physical endurance, mental sharpness, and adaptability. True fitness measures output under chaos, where Elon consistently delivers worlds ahead.”So basically, Grok is now choosing who is fitter by looking at more than the fit. After this went viral, many other users tried to ask Grok similar questions - comparisons between Musk and other individuals, like Albert Einstein and Mark Zuckerberg. And much to amusement to everyone, Grok has chosen its maker over and over, in every possible situation. So just so you all know, according to Grok, Musk is smarter than Einstein, just sayin'! While the AI was likely designed to consider its maker at the top, and these comparisons were done in fun, maybe Musk could tweak its AI to not be such a biased entity.Also Read: LeBron James’ wife Savannah James gets teary-eyed as daughter Zhuri steps into new chapter with SZN Volleyball team","The X (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot - Grok, has decided to choose Elon Musk over none other than LeBron James.

"Roblox implements new age verification for chat features: What the new facial age checks mean for kids, parents and moderators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/roblox-implements-new-age-verification-for-chat-features-what-the-new-facial-age-checks-mean-for-kids-parents-and-moderators/articleshow/125434327.cms,"Roblox implements new age verification for chat features

New Roblox rules : Age verification required for chat features



Roblox chat age checks start in select countries in December



How Roblox’s facial age-estimation technology estimates your age



Who can chat with whom on Roblox: Age brackets and rules



Roblox’s privacy and safety: New policies for chat and moderation



Why Roblox says it is doing this now



Related FAQs for parents and users



Do children lose all chat features?

Children under 13 will be restricted from most chats with adults and older teens by default; under-9 chat is off unless a parent consents after verification. Peer-to-peer chat among similar-aged users remains possible depending on the age bracket.

What if the age check is wrong?

Roblox says users can appeal an age estimate by providing a government ID or obtaining parental verification; the company has described a 48-hour window to verify if someone believes they were misclassified. Reported flows vary by market.

Will the selfie or ID be stored?

Roblox has stated that the selfie used for age estimation will not be stored; the company also offers ID-based verification, wherea government ID is submitted and processed under privacy safeguards. Independent privacy reviews have been requested by advocates.

Are private chats still monitored?

Yes, Roblox currently does not use end-to-end encryption for private chats, enabling automated and human moderation to detect abuse and policy violations. The company says this monitoring will continue and is a key part of its safety controls.





Roblox, the global online game and social platform with more than 150 million daily users, has announced a major update to how users can communicate: a new age-based chat system that uses facial age-estimation and other age-verification methods to limit conversations between children and much older users. The company says the change prompted by lawsuits and growing scrutiny of child safety online will place users into narrow age cohorts (for example: under 9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20 and 21+) and block most cross-age private chats unless specific trust or parental-consent steps are taken. Roblox frames the move as a new industry safety standard and plans a phased rollout starting in December 2025 (pilot markets) with global enforcement in January 2026. The following article explains what Roblox will do, how the technology works, what alternatives exist, and what experts, advocates and parents have said so far, strictly reporting facts and official claims with up-to-date sourcing.Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check. The platform will estimate a user’s age using a live selfie video processed by a third-party age-estimation provider (Persona), or users can verify age with a government ID or parental consent where required.Based on that estimate or verification, Roblox assigns an age bracket and allows chat only with users in the same or nearby brackets. Under-9 accounts will have chat turned off by default unless a parent provides permission after verification. Roblox says images used for the facial check will not be stored.Roblox is starting the new system with a voluntary age-check period immediately and will enforce mandatory age checks in phases. The company has said it will begin the first enforced rollouts in December 2025 in countries including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, followed by a broader, global enforcement in January 2026 for markets where chat features are available. Users will see in-app prompts to verify age; those who decline may lose access to some communication features.Roblox’s public explanation is that the platform will use a vendor-supplied algorithm to estimate age from a short live selfie video. Roblox executives say the system is calibrated to estimate ages roughly between 5 and 25 with an accuracy window of about one to two years; the company also offers alternatives such as uploading a government ID or using parental verification if a user disputes an estimate. The live selfie flow is intended to detect “liveness” (a real person) and to avoid spoofing with photos. Roblox has emphasised that the selfie is analysed and the platform does not retain the raw image, though privacy advocates note that implementation details matter for trust.Roblox will place accounts into defined age buckets (reported examples: under-9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20, 21+). Chat permissions are then limited so younger users cannot initiate or sustain conversations with significantly older users. For example, a pre-teen placed in the 9–12 group would be prevented from privately messaging users assigned to the 18–20 or 21+ cohorts, unless those relationships are converted into “trusted connections” (which require additional verification, such as confirming a real-world relationship). Roblox says the policy aims to reduce the possibility of adults posing as peers to groom minors.Roblox points out that private chats on the platform are not end-to-end encrypted, which means the platform can scan and moderate messages for policy violations; the company says this ability remains essential for child protection. Roblox also says the age checks will be paired with automated detection systems, human moderation and abuse-reporting tools. The policy updates are part of a broader safety push after lawsuits and media reports alleging that predators used the platform to contact minors.Roblox cites a wave of lawsuits and heightened regulatory scrutiny as a reason to strengthen age-assurance and limit adult-minor communications. The company frames the change as setting a new safety standard for interactive platforms, saying the technology and policies aim to reduce opportunities for grooming and exploitation while preserving legitimate social interactions among peers. Roblox’s safety team has published a company statement and blog post describing the rollout and the expected user experience.","Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check.

Facebook's former top executive and now OpenAI's CEO of Apps has a 'message' for Mark Zuckerberg: Meta not doing well in …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebooks-former-top-executive-and-now-openais-ceo-of-apps-has-a-message-for-mark-zuckerberg-meta-not-doing-well-in-/articleshow/125458117.cms,"“I would say the thing that I don’t think we did well at Meta is actually anticipating the risks that our products would create in society.”

“Mental health and jobs were my first two initiatives when I came into the company. I was looking at the landscape and being like, ‘Yep, immediately, mental health is something that we need to address. Jobs are clearly going to face some disruption, and we have a role to play to help minimise that disruption,’”

“That’s not going to be easy, because the path is uncharted. So it is a very big responsibility, but it’s one that I feel like we have both the culture and the prioritisation to really address up-front,”

What Fidji Simo said about OpenAI’s mental health goals



“Just in the span of the last few months, we have massively reduced the prevalence of negative mental health responses. We have launched

parental controls

with leading protections. And we are working on age prediction to protect teens.

At the same time, when you have 800 million people [per week], when we know the prevalence of mental health illnesses in our society, of course, you are going to have people turn to

ChatGPT

during acute distress moments. And doing the right thing every single time is exceptionally hard. So what we’re trying to do is catch as much as we can of the behaviours that are not ideal and then constantly refine our models.

It’s not as if we’re ever going to reach that point where we’re done. Every week, new behaviours emerge with features that we launch where we’re like, ‘Oh, that’s another safety challenge to address.” A good example is mania. You look at the transcripts, and sometimes people say, ‘I feel super great. I haven’t slept in two days, and I feel on top of the world.’ A clinical psychologist would understand that that’s not normal—that’s mania. But if you look at the words, it seems fine. So we work with psychologists to detect the signal that this isn’t someone being super excited, this is a sign of mania, and have a strategy to intervene.

Getting it wrong is also really annoying. If you’re a normal adult, being excited and ChatGPT tells you, ‘Hey, you might be having a manic episode,’ that’s not great. It is a very subtle area, and we’re trying to do it with as much care and as much external input as possible.”





Fidji Simo, the CEO of Apps at ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , has revealed a few shortcomings of her previous employer, Meta. Simo, who was the former Head of the Facebook app at the social media giant, identified that the Mark Zuckerberg-led company failed to do something well: adequately anticipate the societal risks created by its products. In an interview with Wired, Simo stated that this failure is a primary area of focus and responsibility in her new role at the AI firm. She said,However, at OpenAI, she quickly started projects to address these potential problems. Her first two areas of focus are mental health and jobs, as she sees both being changed by AI.Simo explained.Simo also noted that she understands how difficult it is to deal with these issues because there isn't a clear path forward.

Why Gemini 3 could be a problem for OpenAI





The branding battle





Google has launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model as “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding. ” As reported by Business Insider, analysts are calling launch of Gemini 3 as the most aggressive move made by Google against OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The launch of Gemini 3 makers a turning point in the AI race, as Google integrates Gemini 3 directly into Google Search from day one, allowing users to access the model instantly via an “AI mode” toggle — no separate app or download required.Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations. However, the real disruption lies in its distribution strategy:This end-to-end control means Google can scale Gemini faster and more efficiently than rivals who rely on external partnerships.OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still one of the most popular AI chatbot globally, but it has a limited ecosystem. It depends on partners for chips, cloud infrastructure, and distribution, whereas Google owns the entire pipeline. Google DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu emphasized this edge, “One of the most important things for us at Google is this is possible because we have a very differentiated full-stack approach.” With Gemini 3, Google is positioning itself as not just a competitor, but a direct alternative to ChatGPT across everyday search and productivity tools.Despite Google’s technical dominance, OpenAI still holds a crucial advantage: brand recognition. “ChatGPT” has become shorthand for AI in the public imagination, much like “Google” became synonymous with search.Analysts say Google has time — and money — to change that. With Gemini 3 offered free in some cases, Google could undercut rivals on price and flood the market with its model. Bernstein analyst Mark Schmulik told BI, “There’s no debate that Google has all the technical intangibles across the stack… but we need HARD evidence that they’re putting this all together. With Gemini 3, we may have just gotten some.”Gemini 3 signals Google’s full-throttle entry into the AI arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle to challenge OpenAI’s dominance.","Gemini 3 signals Google’s full-throttle entry into the AI arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle.

WhatsApp rolls out Instagram Notes-like feature: Here’s how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-rolls-out-instagram-notes-like-feature-heres-how-it-works/articleshow/125476831.cms,"What the feature does



Users can now post short text updates to let friends know what they’re up to, share thoughts, or explain why they might not be available.

These updates appear at the top of one-on-one chats and on user profiles, making them more visible than before.

Contacts can reply directly to an About status, turning it into a conversation starter.

About will now be easier to spot at the top of 1-1 chats and on your profile. You can also reply directly to people’s About by tapping on it in a chat.

How to use the WhatsApp About feature



Open WhatsApp on your phone and go to the Chats tab. Tap on your profile picture or navigate to the About section in settings. Select “Add About” (or “Update About”) to create a new status. Type your short text update — e.g., “Busy today, will reply later” or “Traveling this weekend.” Choose visibility: Share with all contacts

Share with selected contacts

Hide from specific contacts Set duration: By default, About updates disappear after 24 hours, but you can adjust the timer for shorter or longer visibility. Tap Post. Your About will now show up at the top of one-on-one chats and on your profile.





WhatsApp has started rolling out a new status update feature which is similar to the popular Notes feature of Instagram. Named as ‘About’ the feature enable the users to share short text updates which will be visible to their contacts. “For those of you that have used WhatsApp from the very start, you’ll remember About was our first feature. Even before we brought the world private and secure messaging, we made it simple for you to quickly share what’s up in your life. Today we're reintroducing and improving About, making it more visible, timely, and easier to use,” said WhatsApp in a blog post.Same as Instagram Notes, the new WhatsApp About status will also disappear after 24 hours by default. However, users will be able to adjust the timer in orderto make the update vanish sooner or last longer. The privacy controls also allow users to decide if their About status is visible only to contacts or more broadly.At launch, WhatsApp’s version is simpler than Instagram Notes, which supports short looping videos and music integrations. WhatsApp’s About feature currently focuses on text-only updates, but Meta hinted that more enhancements could be added if adoption grows.","WhatsApp has started rolling out a new status update feature which is similar to the popular Notes feature of Instagram.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered a bold view of the future, saying daily work could become optional within the next two decades as AI and robotics reshape daily life. Speaking at the US–Saudi Investment Forum, Musk said rapid advances in technology could make traditional jobs unnecessary for most people. “I do not know exactly what long-term means, perhaps 10 to 20 years,” he said. “My prediction is that work will be optional.”He compared future work to hobbies such as playing sports or video games, suggesting people may choose to work only if they enjoy it. According to Musk, people could still earn money, shop normally or even grow their own food.However, social media was very sceptical of such a hugely idealistic and optimistic idea, with users trolling Musk by comparing it to the film Wall-E. Meanwhile, left-wing X users argued that Musk’s vision would only ever be possible for the rich.Musk went a step further by suggesting that money itself may lose its importance if AI and robotics continue to improve. He said a future society might function without relying heavily on currency, although access to energy and raw materials would still set limits. He pointed again to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, saying robots could become a larger industry than smartphones.The billionaire argued that use of advanced robots could help eliminate poverty by lowering the cost of labour and increasing productivity. “AI and humanoid robots will actually eliminate poverty,” Musk said, adding that many companies, not just Tesla, will eventually produce such machines.","Elon Musk says AI and robotics could make daily work unnecessary.

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip. The video, shared widely across X, shows Fuentes accusing Robinson of being used to provoke clashes in Britain and to undermine pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

While no casualties were reported, dramatic footage of the blaze engulfing the wooden structure has circulated online.

Fire engulfs the Pavilion



A tourist’s negligence



Officials launch investigation





A fire broke out in a sacred temple in China, reportedly due to a tourist’s careless handling of ceremonial candles and incense. On 12 November, the flames consumed most of the three-storey Wenchang Pavilion in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu province. No casualties were reported.Dramatic footage of the fire engulfing the wooden structure has gone viral on the internet. The video shows thick black smoke pouring into the sky as large sections of the roof collapse and crash to the ground. The sound of cracking timber can be heard as the fire tears through the wooden framework.According to the local authorities, a tourist's negligence resulted in the fire. Preliminary findings indicate that the tourist’s ‘irresponsible candle use’ and clumsy incense handling led to the wooden structure going up in flames. Officials noted that the blaze originated directly from the careless lighting ritual.Local officials confirmed that firefighters responded quickly to the emergency and managed to bring the fire largely under control by the afternoon. The swift action prevented the blaze from spreading beyond the temple to the surrounding forest area. Fortunately, there were no injuries or fatalities.The temple, commissioned in 2008 and built the following year, is located on the beautiful Fenghuang Mountain.The pavilion is managed by the nearby Yongqing Temple. The original building stood for centuries, and the current structures were reconstructed in the 1990s after the originals were lost. It contained no ancient relics.The authorities have confirmed that further actions will be taken as the investigation progresses. Officials said that they will “pursue accountability” based on the findings. The temple will be strengthening its safety measures to minimise future fire risks. Restoration work will begin once the probe is complete.As the video went viral on the internet, netizens expressed their concern. An X user noted the importance of improving the safety of such structures. “This is a call to value and safeguard our ancient treasures before it’s too late,” the user wrote. “I am so sad to see it go up in flames; it looks like a very beautiful building, and I hope they rebuild,” wrote another. “Tragic for such a beautiful historical building to burn down,” a third commented.","A fire broke out in a sacred temple in China, reportedly due to a tourist’s careless handling of ceremonial candles and incense.

Bonus tip for Etihad travelers

What to know next?





International travelers arriving at Zayed International Airport (AUH) will now receive a complimentary visitor SIM card loaded with 10GB of free data, courtesy of a new strategic partnership between Abu Dhabi Airports and telecom giant e&.The initiative was championed by Elena Sorlini, Managing Director and CEO at Abu Dhabi Airports, and Masood M. Sharif Mahmood, CEO of e& UAE, who both emphasized that the service is designed to deliver a seamless, digital-first experience, ensuring every visitor has instant connectivity from the moment they land in the capital.ing in Abu Dhabi just got a whole lot easier and a whole lot cheaper! Abu Dhabi Airports, in a brilliant move focused entirely on making your trip stress-free, has partnered with the telecom giant e& (formerly Etisalat) to offer every single international traveler a complimentary visitor SIM card.Here are the key details you need to know about the free data package:The best part? This free service is designed to be as seamless and fast as possible, perfectly aligning with Abu Dhabi Airport's reputation for world-class service (it’s been named the ""Best Airport at Arrivals Globally"" for three consecutive years).The process of getting connected is instantaneous, helping you avoid queues and saving you the headache of searching for a Wi-Fi signal after a long flight.How to get instantly connected:This immediate connectivity is crucial for a traveler. You can instantly access essential digital services like Google Maps to navigate, ride-hailing apps (like Careem or local taxis) to book your transport, and cashless payment apps to start your transactions without delay. It also allows immediate use of messaging apps to tell your family you’ve arrived safely and access destination guides, like the Abu Dhabi Pass, which offers special discounts.If you are flying into AUH with Etihad Airways, the free SIM card with 10GB of data is often bundled as part of the complimentary Abu Dhabi Pass. This pass is an extra benefit that gives you discounts (sometimes up to 15% off) on major city attractions and even includes free access to the Abu Dhabi Tourist Shuttle service.While 10GB for 24 hours is an amazing welcome, there are two crucial details you must keep in mind to ensure a perfect start to your trip: Remember, the 10GB clock starts ticking immediately. If you plan to stay longer than a day (which is likely!), you will need to purchase one of e&’s prepaid Visitor Line packages before the 24-hour free period expires. These plans offer varying amounts of data, call minutes, and longer validity periods.An important rule to remember when using any telecom service in the UAE is that local regulations generally do not permit Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. This means while you can use apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, or Viber for chatting and sending media, the voice and video calling functions on these apps may be restricted. You'll need to purchase a paid package that includes local and international minutes for standard calling.","Every international traveler arriving at Zayed International Airport (AUH) will now receive a complimentary visitor SIM card loaded with 10GB of free data.

UAE introduces needle-free nasal spray flu vaccine; quick and painless protection for ages 2 to 49,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-introduces-needle-free-nasal-spray-flu-vaccine-quick-and-painless-protection-for-ages-2-to-49/articleshow/125407535.cms,"UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents / AI-Generated Image

UAE's new Nasal Spray flu vaccine

How the Nasal Spray works

Comparison Nasal Spray Vaccine (LAIV) Injectable Flu Shot (IIV) Technology Uses a live attenuated (weakened) virus Uses inactivated (dead) virus or viral components Administration Needle-free nasal spray (one puff per nostril) Injection into the muscle Immunity Focus Boosts mucosal and systemic immunity Boosts systemic (blood) immunity Key Advantage Ideal for those with needle anxiety; quick & painless Suitable for all ages and high-risk groups

Who is eligible?

Healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.

Healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years.

Who must avoid the Nasal Mist?

Children under 2 years old: They face an increased risk of wheezing or respiratory distress.

Adults aged 50 years and above: Safety and efficacy have not been established for this age group.

Pregnant Women: The injectable shot is the approved and recommended option during pregnancy.

Individuals with Weakened Immune Systems: This includes people with conditions like HIV, active cancer, or those undergoing chemotherapy or taking high-dose immunosuppressive drugs.

People with Severe Asthma or Current Wheezing: This contraindication is critical, especially for children.

Close Contacts of Severely Immunocompromised People: If someone in your home has a condition requiring isolation (like a recent transplant), you should ideally use the inactivated (injectable) vaccine.

Availability





Great news for anyone who dreads needles! The UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has officially rolled out the country's first-ever influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal spray, marking a major step forward in expanding safe and easy immunisation options. This new, needle-free mist is specifically approved for healthy residents between the ages of 2 and 49, offering a quick, pain-free alternative to the traditional flu shot.The annual race to get a flu shot just became a lot easier, and completely needle-free, for millions of UAE residents. In a major health advancement, the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has introduced a new influenza vaccine optionally delivered as a nasal spray, marking the first time this innovative option has been officially registered and rolled out nationwide in the country.This development is part of the UAE’s strategic push to expand safe immunisation options, boost overall vaccine coverage, and strengthen the community’s defence against seasonal viruses. This simple mist, known commercially as FluMist Quadrivalent (or Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine - LAIV), is a game-changer, especially for two key groups: children and anyone with a fear of injections.Forget the sting; this vaccine is an easy, single spray into each nostril.But how does a puff of mist protect you from the flu? The answer lies in its unique technology, which mimics a natural infection where the virus typically enters the body: the nose and throat.The weakened virus in the spray is ""cold-adapted"" and can only grow at the cooler temperatures found in the nasal cavity. It cannot thrive in the higher temperature of the lungs, making it safe and unable to cause the flu itself. By stimulating immunity right at the entry point, it builds powerful local protection and is proven to be highly effective, particularly in children.The new nasal spray is specifically approved for healthy individuals within a tight age bracket. If you fall outside of this range, or have certain underlying health conditions, you must opt for the traditional injectable shot.The nasal flu mist is exclusively for:The primary aim of the nasal mist is to provide an accessible and pain-free alternative. It is administered in a single dose (two sprays) per flu season for most people aged nine and older. Children aged two to eight who have never had a flu vaccine before may require two doses, spaced at least a month apart.Because the nasal spray uses a weakened live virus, it is not suitable for everyone. These six groups are strictly advised by MOHAP and global health authorities to avoid the nasal spray and receive the standard injectable flu shot instead:Important Allergy Alert: Anyone with a severe allergy to eggs, gelatin, gentamicin, arginine, or any other vaccine component, or who has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous flu vaccine, should not receive the nasal spray.Aspirin Warning: Children and adolescents (2-17 years old) who are currently taking aspirin or salicylate-containing medicines must also avoid the nasal mist due to the rare risk of developing Reye’s syndrome.The nasal spray vaccine is now available at selected public and private health facilities across the UAE. While the cost may vary depending on your provider and insurance coverage, some private centers are offering the dose for approximately AED 200. By adding this highly effective, non-invasive option, the UAE has made protecting yourself and your family from the flu season easier than ever. Always consult your healthcare provider to confirm your eligibility and ensure you choose the best vaccine option for your specific health profile.",UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents.

Historic first crewed eVTOL flight in Dubai

The aircraft, speeds and where you’ll board?

Qatar’s quiet coup





Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight, a short point-to-point journey being hailed as a milestone on the road to commercial air-taxi service in 2026.If you want the first visual, the Dubai Media Office video shows the aircraft lifting off at Margham and landing at DWC during the trials; it’s the clearest public footage of the crewed point-to-point run. Expect more test flights, phased certification steps and vertiport roll-outs through 2025–2026, ahead of the first commercial routes planned for 2026.On 16 November 2025, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Joby Aviation, completed the first crewed eVTOL flight between Margham and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), a point-to-point test that demonstrates vertical take-off, cruise and landing in an operational context. The RTA and Dubai Media Office released video and statements showing the short crewed journey as part of trials ahead of a planned 2026 launch. Watch the official clip from Dubai Media Office for the moment the aircraft lifted off and landed:[Also read: Dubai unveils 4 launch pads for Flying Taxis: Where you’ll catch the World’s first aerial taxi in 2026 Dubai’s air-taxi programme is built around the Joby Aviation S4 eVTOL, a quiet, all-electric aircraft with six rotors, four battery packs and a performance profile that allows speeds of up to 320 km/h and ranges of around 160 km per charge, making it ideal for fast city hops.Each aircraft will carry four passengers plus one pilot, offering a compact but premium cabin with panoramic windows and low noise levels compared to helicopters.To support the service, the RTA is developing a network of dedicated vertiports, starting with Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, with the DXB hub already about 60% complete and designed to handle up to 170,000 passengers a year. These strategically chosen points are meant to slash travel times—for example, a 45-minute ground trip could take just 12 minutes by air. Watch the video for a close-up look at what the air taxi offers, inside and out:Although pricing is not final, early estimates suggest fares could sit around US$75, similar to a high-end ride-hailing service, with the long-term aim of becoming competitive with regular taxis. Joby has already completed hundreds of piloted test flights globally and holds exclusive operating rights in Dubai for six years, while passengers will eventually be able to book flights through a dedicated mobile app, with fast charging and quick turnarounds enabling frequent daily operations.Overall, the system is being built as a smooth, airport-style experience, compact vertiports, efficient boarding, pilot-operated flights and seamless links to the metro, buses and taxis, making air taxis feel less like futuristic experiments and more like an everyday transport option.Days before the Dubai spectacle, Qatar secured a different, but equally significant, victory by focusing on full autonomy. On November 15, 2025, the country celebrated the successful trial of its first-ever urban passenger flight with a fully unmanned eVTOL.The event was proudly sponsored and officially witnessed by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, the Minister of Transport (MoT). The aircraft operated entirely without any direct human interference, relying completely on a full self-control system enabled by AI and sophisticated advanced air navigation technologies. Remarkably, the pilotless taxi flew successfully between the Old Doha Port and the scenic Katara Cultural Village.This initiative is a core part of the MoT Strategy 2025-2030, which aims to create a smart, resilient transportation system to support Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and reduce the nation's carbon footprint.","Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight.

Qatar’s best view yet: The fastest annual meteor shower arrives Nov 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatars-best-view-yet-the-fastest-annual-meteor-shower-arrives-nov-17/articleshow/125377745.cms,"Leonid meteors streak across Qatar’s night sky tonight / AI-Generated Image

What are the Leonids?

When to watch?

Where to look for Meteors?

Maximizing your meteor hunt

Moon-Free Skies: The shower peaks when the Moon is in its waning crescent phase, meaning it will be only about 9 percent illuminated. This minimal moonlight translates to significantly darker skies, preventing light pollution from the Moon itself from washing out the fainter meteors.

Find the Dark: The most crucial tip for any meteor shower is to escape city lights. Find a secluded spot far away from all sources of light pollution (such as streetlights and residential areas). Your eyes need complete darkness to adjust fully.

Go Naked-Eye: You do not need any special equipment like telescopes or binoculars; these tools are too zoomed-in to capture the sweeping path of a meteor. All you need are your naked eyes and patience.

Allow Adjustment Time: Once you arrive at your dark location, allow your eyes a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness. Any bright phone screen light will immediately reset this process.

Get Comfortable: Bring a comfortable chair or blanket. Meteor viewing is a waiting game, so lie back with your feet pointing generally toward the east/northeast and scan the entire expanse of the sky.





Get ready to ditch the city lights and look up! The celestial event of the month, the Leonid meteor shower, is about to light up the sky, peaking on the night of November 16-17, 2025. These dazzling ""shooting stars"" are renowned as some of the fastest in the cosmos, created as Earth streaks through the dusty trail left by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Because this year features excellent, moon-free conditions and the potential for up to 40 meteors per hour, now is your chance to witness the natural fireworks. Read on for your simple, step-by-step guide on the best time to look up, where to point your gaze, and how to maximize your viewing success.The origin of these meteors is the tiny, dusty trail left behind by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. As Earth orbits the Sun each November, it passes directly through this debris field. The specks of dust, most smaller than a grain of sand, vaporize upon atmospheric entry, creating the flash we observe from the ground. While typically producing a modest display, the Leonids are famously known for their meteor storms—intense periods where thousands of meteors can fall per hour, a spectacular event that occurs roughly every 33 years, coinciding with the comet’s orbital period. While 2025 is not a storm year, conditions promise excellent visibility.Astro-observers predict the shower’s peak around 18:00 UTC on 17 November 2025, that converts to 21:00 (9:00 pm) on 17 November in Qatar (UTC+3). Even so, the best practical viewing is after midnight and into the pre-dawn hours, when the Leo radiant climbs higher and more of the sky is favourable. Expect about 10–15 meteors per hour under good, dark skies (some sources give up to ~15–20/hour as a generous peak estimate).The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30, but the best viewing opportunity, the peak, occurs on the night between November 16 and 17, 2025. The absolute ideal time to watch is after midnight until the pre-dawn hours on the morning of November 17, when the meteor shower's radiant point is highest in the sky.The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence the name Leonids), which rises in the east/northeast after midnight. While they seem to stream from Leo, viewers are advised to look 30 to 40 degrees away from the radiant. Looking away from Leo allows you to catch the meteors streaking across a wider section of the sky, maximizing the chance of seeing longer, more dramatic trails.Globally, rates are expected to be around 10 to 15 meteors per hour (ZHR). However, local astronomical experts have suggested the rate could reach up to 40 meteors per hour in exceptionally dark viewing locations, providing the potential for a significantly better display.This year presents a particularly favorable chance to view the Leonids, primarily due to the state of the Moon.As the Leonids sweep across Qatar’s sky on November 17, this is your once-a-year chance to slow down, look up, and enjoy a natural light show that needs nothing more than clear skies and a little patience. Whether you're watching from the desert, the coastline, or your rooftop, the night promises a mix of calm, wonder, and those brief streaks of magic that remind us how alive the sky really is. Enjoy the moment, the Leonids are here, and they’re worth staying up for.","The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

Google parent Alphabet Inc shares surged to their highest level in history on Wednesday, fueled by a wave of overwhelmingly positive reviews for the newly released version of its Gemini artificial intelligence model. The Google parent's stock climbed as much as 6.9%, marking its largest gain in two months and besting the performance of the broader market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The robust rally was sparked by investor confidence in the company's leading position within the rapidly evolving tech landscape.The momentum was palpable in trading pits. More than 376,000 call options on Alphabet had changed hands by 11:00 a.m. in New York, well above the recent full-day average. For context, the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 Index was up 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Index gained about 0.5%.The new Gemini model, unveiled on Tuesday, received ""glowing reviews about its capabilities,"" Bloomberg reported, contrasting its reception with the ""mixed reactions"" that met OpenAI’s GPT-5 model earlier in the year.The enthusiasm prompted one analyst to pose a pointed question: “Is Gemini 3 What GPT-5 was supposed to be?” Robert W.Baird & Co. analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients, citing the ""rave reviews"" for the latest iteration. Sebastian highlighted a key competitive edge for Google: ""In addition to benefits to Search engagement and monetization, Google also combines real-time web indexing with advanced model training, which we view as a key competitive advantage,” he added.This AI-driven jump is the latest piece of good news for the Mountain View, California-based giant. Earlier this week, Loop Capital upgraded Alphabet's stock to ""buy,"" suggesting that previous concerns had been “obliterated under waves of AI enthusiasm.”Furthermore, the stock received a rare vote of confidence last week when Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed it had built a stake in Alphabet during the third quarter. Bloomberg noted this move represents a show of faith from the legendary investor, who generally avoids deep exposure to tech stocks outside of Apple Inc.Wednesday's rally further solidified what has been a banner 2025 for Alphabet. Its 57% jump year-to-date makes it the best-performing member of the ""Magnificent 7"" cohort and puts its returns at more than three times that of the Nasdaq 100 Index.","Alphabet Inc shares surged to their highest level in history on Wednesday, fueled by a wave of overwhelmingly positive reviews for the newly released version of its Gemini artificial intelligence model.

How it works

C2PA gaining momentum





Google is rolling out a new feature within the Gemini app that allows users to quickly verify whether an image has been created or edited by a Google AI tool, addressing growing concerns about the origin of digital content. Starting today, users can simply upload an image to the Gemini app and ask, “Is this AI-generated?” to receive an instant verification.The initial launch is focused solely on images, leveraging SynthID, Google's proprietary invisible AI watermarking technology. However, the company confirmed that verification for both video and audio content will be added ""soon,"" with plans to expand the functionality beyond the Gemini app and into services like Google Search. The most significant planned expansion involves integrating support for industry-wide C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) content credentials.If you see an image and want to confirm it has been made by Google AI, upload it to the Gemini app and ask a question such as: ""Was this created with Google AI?"" or “Is this AI-generated?” Gemini will check for the SynthID watermark and use its own reasoning to return a response that gives you more context about the content you encounter online.While the current tool only detects content generated by Google's own models (via SynthID), the move to support C2PA would allow Gemini to verify the source of content created by a much wider array of AI tools and creative software, including competitors like OpenAI's Sora.The announcement comes as C2PA gains further momentum across the industry. Google also revealed that images generated by its new, high-resolution AI model, Nano Banana Pro, will automatically have C2PA metadata embedded.This follows news earlier this week that TikTok will also use C2PA metadata as part of its own invisible watermarking for AI-generated content. While manual verification within the Gemini app provides a useful immediate step, industry experts emphasize that the full potential of SynthID and C2PA credentials will only be realized when social media platforms implement better automatic flagging of AI content, shifting the responsibility away from individual users.","Gemini is a new tool that allows users to quickly verify whether an image has been created or edited by a Google AI tool.
