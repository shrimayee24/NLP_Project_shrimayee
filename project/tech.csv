NEW DELHI: Army has announced phase II of Agniveer recruitment process . ""This phase marks a significant milestone in the Army's efforts to transform its requirements procedures and ensure a seamless and efficient selection process for aspiring candidates. It is free, fair, and transparent so all candidates are advised not to approach any type of tout,"" PRO defence, Guwahati said, reports ANI.

Agnipath recruitment scheme was rolled out in June 2022 for short-term induction of personnel with the aim of bringing down the age profile of the three services. Under the scheme, recruitment of youths between the age bracket of 17-and-half years and 21 for four years is done with a provision to retain 25% of them for 15 more years. The recruitment process involves two phases, the first being an online written examination and the second being the recruitment rally.

Recently, a group of secretaries from 10 key ministries were tasked to review the scheme. They were asked to suggest ways to make the armed forces recruitment programme more attractive. The scheme became a key election issue in the poll campaign with opposition parties, especially Congress, vowing to revoke it, if voted to power. The panel of secretaries is expected to give a final presentation to PM Narendra Modi.

Health risks of laptop heat on your body; here's what every user should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/health-risks-of-laptop-heat-on-your-body-heres-what-every-user-should-know/articleshow/111239097.cms,"What are the common sources of laptop heat

Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): The CPU and GPU are the primary sources of heat in a laptop. These components perform complex computations and processes, which generate significant heat, especially during intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or running multiple applications.

Battery: Laptop batteries, especially during charging and discharging, can produce considerable heat. Older batteries or those in poor condition tend to overheat more frequently.

Hard Drive and Solid State Drive (SSD): Data processing and storage activities within hard drives and SSDs also contribute to heat generation, although SSDs typically generate less heat compared to traditional hard drives.

Cooling systems: Fans and heat sinks are designed to dissipate heat away from the laptop's internal components. However, dust accumulation and inadequate ventilation can impair their effectiveness, leading to increased surface temperatures.

External environment: Using laptops in hot environments or on surfaces that block ventilation, such as beds or couches, can exacerbate overheating issues.

Health effects of laptop heat on human body

Skin burns and heat rash: Prolonged contact with a hot laptop can cause skin burns or heat rash, especially on the thighs and legs. This condition, often referred to as ""toasted skin syndrome"" or erythema ab igne, is characterised by red, mottled skin.

Reproductive health issues: For men, placing a laptop on the lap for extended periods can increase scrotal temperature, potentially affecting sperm quality and fertility.

Musculoskeletal problems: The discomfort from laptop heat can lead to poor posture as users adjust their position to avoid the heat. This can result in musculoskeletal issues, including back and neck pain.

Discomfort and reduced productivity: The general discomfort caused by excessive heat can hinder concentration and productivity, leading to a less efficient work environment.

Ways to reduce the impact of laptop heat

Use a laptop cooling pad: Cooling pads provide additional ventilation and help dissipate heat away from the laptop, reducing its surface temperature.

Avoid direct contact: Place your laptop on a desk or table instead of your lap. If using it on your lap is necessary, use a laptop stand or a cushion to create a barrier between your skin and the device.

Maintain good ventilation: Ensure that your laptop's vents are not obstructed. Clean the vents regularly to remove dust and improve airflow.

Take breaks: Taking regular breaks can prevent prolonged exposure to heat. This also promotes better posture and reduces the risk of musculoskeletal problems.

Update software: Keep your laptop's software and drivers updated. Updates often include performance improvements that can reduce heat generation.

Monitor temperature: Use software tools to monitor your laptop's temperature. This can help you take proactive measures if the device starts to overheat.

Service your laptop: Regular maintenance, including cleaning the internal components and replacing thermal paste, can improve your laptop's cooling efficiency.

Choose a well-ventilated environment: Using your laptop in a cool, well-ventilated environment can significantly reduce overheating issues.

Now after several delays, no date has been given Nasa was aware of the helium leak but considered it too minor to pose a safety risk. Afdter reaching the orbit, the spacecraft developed four additional helium leaks making one thruster unusable. The delay is attributed to several helium leaks discovered on Boeing’s Starliner The space agency further said that astronauts Wilmore and Sunita Williams can undock from the space station and return to Earth if needed. They are not “stranded”, but are staying in orbit beyond their scheduled return to allow mission teams adequate time to analyse propulsion system data.

'When will Elon Musk step in'

As Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams and her colleague astronaut Butch Wilmore are stuck at the International Space Station owing to multiple technical issues in Starliner, embattled Boeing has again come under fire as its two 737 Max crashes have not rightfully slipped into oblivion. After causing deaths of 5779 on Earth, Boeing sent the two astronauts to Space despite knowing the flaws of Starliner.""At this point I wouldn't even trust a PB&J sandwich made by Boeing,"" an X by a social media user went viral after the latest glitch news of Starliner. ""At this point, I don't think @Boeing can even spell ""PB&J"","" wrote another user.Social media users are also raising questions as to when Elon Musk would step in to rescue Starliner as Elon Musk's SpaceX could send a Crew Dragon Spacecraft to provide an alternative return to Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

We're sharing an update on the advanced Voice Mode we demoed during our Spring Update, which we remain very excited about:

We had planned to start rolling this out in alpha to a small group of ChatGPT Plus users in late June, but need one more month to reach our bar to launch. For example, we’re improving the model’s ability to detect and refuse certain content. We’re also working on improving the user experience and preparing our infrastructure to scale to millions while maintaining real-time responses.

As part of our iterative deployment strategy, we'll start the alpha with a small group of users to gather feedback and expand based on what we learn. We are planning for all Plus users to have access in the fall. Exact timelines depend on meeting our high safety and reliability bar. We are also working on rolling out the new video and screen sharing capabilities we demoed separately, and will keep you posted on that timeline.

ChatGPT’s advanced Voice Mode can understand and respond with emotions and non-verbal cues, moving us closer to real-time, natural conversations with AI. Our mission is to bring these new experiences to you thoughtfully.

And there are a few sets of data that come in through manual input - via iPads or mobile devices.""This integration of disparate data sources allows Indigrid to do amazing things, says Satish - like cutting down fewer trees. ""Vegetation is a big challenge we encounter because if a tree height goes beyond a certain clearance, the power line will trip. So, we use drone and satellite-based monitoring to get data and then run image analytics on it, which tells us exactly when a tree will grow to be a problem. It's a scientific method that allows us to cut 100 branches of trees instead of a thousand.""Chittaranjan says professionals should consider getting into the rapidly growing sustainability sector. ""We think this is the decade of sustainability because everybody has done their digital transformation already, the next transformation they are doing is sustainability.

Save money on your OTT subscriptions with these best tips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/save-money-on-your-ott-subscriptions-with-these-best-tips/articleshow/111267043.cms,"Tips to slash your OTT subscription costs

Evaluate your subscriptions

How often do you use each service?

Are there overlapping content offerings?

Which services offer the most value for your viewing preferences?

Take advantage of free trials

Bundle subscriptions

Share subscriptions with family and friends

Look for discounts and promotions

Opt for ad-supported plans

Downgrade to a lower tier

Cancel unused subscriptions

Take advantage of yearly plans

Keep an eye on price increases

Rotate OTT subscriptions based on content releases

Use cashback and reward programs

Use public libraries

Monitor your viewing habits

In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment. These platforms offer a vast array of content, from movies and TV shows to documentaries and live sports, making it possible to access virtually any type of entertainment on demand. The convenience and variety offered by OTT services have led to their widespread adoption, and many households now subscribe to multiple streaming platforms to cater to diverse viewing preferences.However, with the increasing number of available options, managing multiple subscriptions can become overwhelming and costly. Each platform typically requires a separate subscription fee, and these costs can quickly add up, putting a strain on your budget. Moreover, the abundance of content across various services means that it's easy to subscribe to more than you actually need or use, leading to unnecessary expenses.Fortunately, there are several strategies you can employ to save money on OTT subscriptions without sacrificing your viewing experience. By being strategic about your subscription choices and making the most of available offers and features, you can enjoy your favourite shows and movies while keeping costs under control.The first step towards saving on OTT subscriptions is to evaluate your current subscriptions. List all the streaming services you subscribe to and consider the following:By assessing your usage and preferences, you can identify subscriptions to cancel or downgrade. If you rarely watch content on a particular platform, consider cancelling it and redirecting those funds to a service you use more frequently.Many OTT platforms offer free trials for new users, ranging from a week to a month. Use these free trials to explore different services and their content libraries without committing financially. Set reminders to cancel the trial before it ends to avoid charges. You can also take turns using free trials from different platforms to enjoy their content without paying for multiple subscriptions simultaneously.Many streaming services provide bundled packages that combine multiple subscriptions at a reduced price. For instance, Disney+ offers a bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+ for less than the cost of subscribing to each service separately. Search for bundles that match your viewing habits and preferences to save money.Many OTT platforms permit multiple profiles or simultaneous streaming on various devices. Utilise this feature by sharing subscriptions with family members or friends. Split the cost of a subscription among multiple users to reduce individual expenses. Check each platform's terms of service to ensure you are not violating any rules.Watch for discounts and promotions from OTT platforms, as many services provide special deals during holidays, anniversaries, or other significant events. Additionally, some platforms provide discounts for students, military personnel, and senior citizens. Sign up for newsletters or follow the platforms on social media to stay informed about upcoming promotions.Many streaming services provide ad-supported plans at a reduced cost compared to their ad-free versions. Although watching ads might be a slight inconvenience, it can lead to substantial savings. Evaluate whether ad-supported plans are a viable option for you, especially if the cost difference is substantial.If you don't need all the features offered by your current subscription tier, consider downgrading to a lower tier. If you're currently subscribed to a premium plan that includes 4K streaming but primarily watch content on a standard HD screen, transitioning to a standard plan could be a cost-saving option. Evaluate your viewing habits and requirements to decide if downgrading to a lower-tier plan would meet your needs effectively.Over time, it's common to collect multiple subscriptions, some of which may remain unused. Regularly assess your subscriptions and cancel those that are no longer in use. This straightforward action can redirect funds to more worthwhile purposes. Be vigilant about monitoring cancellation deadlines to prevent unnecessary charges for services you no longer require.Choosing a yearly plan instead of monthly subscriptions can lead to significant savings. Numerous OTT platforms offer discounts on annual subscriptions, equating to several months of service for free compared to monthly rates. Opting for a yearly plan is a prudent decision if you anticipate long-term use of a service, ensuring cost-effectiveness in the long run.Streaming services occasionally increase their subscription prices. Stay informed about upcoming price hikes and evaluate whether the service still offers good value at the new rate. If a price increase makes a subscription less affordable, consider switching to a different service or taking advantage of available promotions.The content offerings on OTT platforms are dynamic, regularly updating with new movies and shows while removing others. To optimise your savings, consider rotating your subscriptions according to the release schedules of your preferred content. Subscribe to a service for a period, enjoy the content you want, then cancel and switch to another platform. This method ensures you only pay for subscriptions when actively watching content that aligns with your current interests.Certain credit cards and cashback apps provide rewards for streaming service transactions, allowing you to earn cashback or points that can be used towards future subscriptions. Additionally, several OTT platforms have referral programs that offer incentives such as free months of service for referring new subscribers. These programs can help you maximise savings and get more value out of your streaming subscriptions.Several public libraries collaborate with streaming platforms like Kanopy and Hoopla to provide complimentary access to their services. Contact your local library to inquire about available OTT services, enabling you to enjoy a wide selection of movies and shows at no extra expense.Finally, paying attention to your viewing habits can assist you in making well-informed choices regarding your subscriptions. Monitor the time you spend on each platform and the types of content you enjoy the most. This data can help you select subscriptions that are not only cost-effective but also cater to your entertainment preferences effectively.","In the age of streaming, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have completely transformed the way we consume entertainment.

Apple Intelligence launch in China may face these three ‘challenges’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-launch-in-china-may-face-these-three-challenges/articleshow/111147927.cms,"Tough rules for AI models

Ban on ChatGPT, which will be integrated in Apple devices

China has tough rules for AI models

Ban on OpenAI’s ChatGPT in China

Private Cloud Compute

Apple has announced Apple Intelligence , a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs. The AI features will be available later this year to users globally, including China – one the most critical markets for the company. However, the company’s big AI push may face some challenges in China as regulators have in place strict rules around the technology amid tough competition.The three challenges that the company may face in China are (via CNBC):China’s AI market is tightly regulated and all companies launching AI models must have approval from the regulators for the commercial use of LLMs. The country has also made it mandatory for Generative AI providers to take down “illegal” content.Since some of the features of Apple Intelligence are developed by the company itself, Apple will likely need to get its AI model approved by authorities under Chinese rules.China has also banned OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Some of Apple’s voice assistant Siri’s capabilities are dependent on ChatGPT. This could mean that Apple may have to find a local AI company that provides the same level of capabilities as ChatGPT. Baidu and Alibaba are among China’s technology giants that have their own LLMs and voice assistants.Apple's AI launch highlighted a focus on user privacy. Their new system, Private Cloud Compute, processes user data on Apple-owned servers, with the company claiming the data itself is not stored.However, in China, Apple's iCloud data is stored on servers located locally and operated by a third party. This may raise concerns about whether Apple can maintain complete control over its AI computing servers in the country.This means that Apple must have a similar partnership for its AI servers in the region to keep user data private.","Apple has announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that will run on iPhones, iPads and Mac PCs.

https://instaservices.hdfcbank.com/?journey=107&source_type=103

Starting June 25, HDFC Bank will stop sending text alerts for low-value UPI transactions. This means that HDFC Bank customers will receive SMS alerts for UPI transactions exceeding Rs 100 when sending money and similar notification for when received is above Rs 500. However, the bank will continue to send email alerts for all transactions with no absolutely change.In a mail as well as SMS alert sent to its customers, HDFC Bank said: “Starting from 25th June, 2024: Email Alerts: Continue to receive email alerts for all UPI transactions. SMS Notifications: Now only for transactions above Rs 100 (money sent/paid) and Rs 500 (money received).”This change aligns with banking norms, which require text messages for transactions over Rs 5,000. Despite this, many banks send alerts for lower-value debits as well. HDFC Bank stated that feedback indicated alerts for low-value transactions were deemed 'not useful,' as there is often duplication of notifications from UPI payment apps.Bankers noted that bulk text messages cost between Rs 0.01-0.03 each. With UPI transactions averaging around 40 crores per day, banks collectively spend several crores daily on text message alerts.Banks are also promoting the use of UPI Lite for transactions up to Rs 500. UPI Lite allows a small amount of money to be set aside by the app, facilitating quick payments without the need for second-factor authentication.By reducing the frequency of low-value transaction alerts, HDFC Bank and others aim to streamline notifications for customers while also cutting costs.
