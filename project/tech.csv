Michelle Beadle’s ESPN Career

Earlier, X, formerly known as Twitter was flooded with Shannon Sharpe memes. Why? Apparently an explicit video went live from his Instagram account where there appeared to be a steamy activity. And, somewhere in that video, one name was heard, that is former ESPN host Michelle Beadle . Now she comes up with her reply to all these news.The name of the woman in the video has become a subject of speculation among sports followers since the leak of the viral video.The highly controversial video did not show more than a floorboard, but it captured distinct grunting sounds that turned heads. At one point during the broadcast, a male voice could be heard saying, ""That's my Michelle,"" which set frenzy speculation online.This viral moment got the social media users going with a wild guess that the lady involved was former ESPN host Michelle Beadle. Immediately, her name was tagged with the video, and consequently, her mentions started pouring in from all corners. Michelle Beadle, who had a pretty significant career in ESPN, was back in headlines as the whole drama unfolded.Rather than let those rumors spiral even further, Beadle took matters into his own hands and addressed the situation via a post that quickly went viral in and of itself. ""It was not me,"" Beadle clarified, accompanied with a smiley-face emoji.Beadle divided her time at ESPN into two phases: the first from 2009 to 2012 and the second from 2014 to 2019. Since leaving the network, she consistently appeared in regular segments across sports media, including as co-host of several shows, among them being ""Beadle & Decker"" on SiriusXM's Mad Dog Sports Radio and ""Run It Back"" forFanDuel TV . Her diversity of roles speaks to a continued influence within the sports industry.Meanwhile, Shannon Sharpe, the most recent connection to ESPN, has remained a regular contributor on ""First Take"" following his departure from Fox Sports 1. Though it's anyone's guess what comes next for him, no formal comment about the situation has been provided by ESPN to this point, and it remains to be seen if that ever happens.The viral video might have thus stirred speculation, but Beadle's response was quick and clear to dispel the rumors. Living in a time when misinformation can spread like wildfire, fans and media appreciated her hilarious yet decisive manner of handling things.","Former ESPN host Michelle Beadle responded to the Shannon Sharpe video leak.

Professional wrestling superstars always leave lasting legacies behind, and Sid Eudy, better known as Sid Vicious is no exception. Throughout his career, he achieved remarkable professional accomplishments such as winning the WWE World Championship as well as headlining WrestleMania twice, in 1992 against Hulk Hogan, and in 1997 against The Undertaker.Even though these accolades solidified his status as a wrestling legend, his impressive fight moves, and enigmatic persona earned him enormous popularity. Recently, there have been some discussions about whether he should be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame . This consideration reflects his impactful presence and imposing status in the professional wrestling world. As the talks on the subject continue, many have come forward with clashing opinions. Ted DiBiase is one such individual who has shared his views on the subject in detail. Let’s delve into what he said.Death of the wrestling legend, Sid Eudy (popularly known as Sid Vicious) on August 26 is still fresh on the fans’ minds. His demise came after his prolonged battle with cancer causing the fans and many WWE officials to pay tribute to him. This also includes his son, Gunnar who wrote a lengthy message on social media honoring his father’s resilience, determination, and love for family.However, the discussions following his death were not simply limited to his contribution to wrestling. WWE officials are considering whether he should be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. While opinions have differed on this subject, former wrestling champion, Ted DiBiase commented on Eudy’s potential as a recipient of the honor.DiBiase, recently, appeared on the podcast, “Everybody’s Got a Pod” where he shared his thoughts on the subject. He explained that being inducted into the Hall of Fame isn’t just about a wrestler’s performance or fame. Instead, he believes that it involves looking at how well the wrestlers worked with others and whether they contributed positively to the team. Putting in his own words,“The Hall of Fame, it's not just about your ring skill or how big of a star you were. I think more, especially in wrestling it's did you work well with everybody? Did you work as a team? I mean I can name and I won't name anybody ... there's a couple guys in the Hall of Fame that were never in a main event or very rarely in a main event, and did a lot of opening matches and middle of the road stuff. So it's not just how good you were on a microphone or in the ring, I think part of it is strength of character ... I would give [Vicious] the benefit of the doubt.”Since Vicious’ demise, many well-known figures in the industry shed light on their experiences of working with him. These include Booker T, Kevin Nash, and Jeff Jarrett who have fond memories with him and highlighted the positive impact Vicious had on their careers.","Sid Vicious, better known as Sid Eudy, died on August 26 after a prolonged battle with cancer.

Verdict



Nothing is back with a new pair of earbuds. The new CMF Buds Pro 2 earphones sport several features, including multipoint connectivity, fast pair and active noise cancellation – for Rs 4,299 in India. The CMF Buds Pro 2 is available in four colours -- Orange, Dark Grey, Light Grey and Blue. We’ve been testing the TWS earbuds in a Dark Grey colour.How do these new earbuds stack up against other rivals? Let’s dive deeper and find out what we think about the latest earbuds.The CMF Buds Pro 2 by Nothing showcases a distinctive design language that aligns well with the CMF Watch Pro 2 and CMF Phone 1, which was launched along with the TWS earbuds.The charging case is squircle-shaped with flat sides and crafted from soft plastic that feels like rubber and is great to touch. This tactile choice makes sense as we had frequent interactions with the case.A standout feature is the multifunctionalSmart Dial located in the corner of the case. This disc not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also adds functionality. We spent a lot of time fiddling with the case and the disc.The disc on the earbuds case allowed us to control the volume by rotating it and playing/pausing music with a single tap. By double-tapping the dial, we switched between different active noise cancellation modes and enabled Low Lag mode with a triple-tap.All these functions are customisable through the Nothing X companion app, making the Smart Dial a more intuitive and versatile way to interact with the earbuds compared to traditional touch-sensitive controls on the earbuds.However, the soft plastic tends to smudge easily, hence, it needs regular wiping. The earbuds sport long stems that include touch-sensitive areas to control playback, handle calls and switch between noise control modes.Comfort is a key highlight of the CMF Buds Pro 2. They are lightweight and do not cause ear fatigue, making them suitable for extended wear. The CMF Buds Pro 2 provided a pleasant experience, especially during long flights or cab and metro rides.Regarding the sound quality, the CMF Buds Pro 2 delivered a strong performance, particularly for bass enthusiasts. The dual driver setup, featuring an 11mm titanium-coated driver and a 6mm tweeter, produces good audio output for bass-heavy songs. The buds also support high-resolution audio codecs like LDAC and AAC, ensuring a crisp and detailed listening experience on compatible devices.Tracks like ""Do I Wanna Know?"" by Arctic Monkeys, ""Panda"" by Desiigner featuring Wiz Khalifa, and ""Venom"" by Eminem packed a punch even at medium volumes. With Ultra Bass mode enabled via the companion app, the bass becomes so powerful above 70% volume that it can be overwhelming, prompting us to lower the volume.The companion app also offers customisation options for tailoring the audio to personal preferences. The Dirac Opteo option is great for watching movies and gaming, though it can't be used with the LDAC codec.The earbuds' default tuning ensures that the bass doesn't overpower the mids and lows when listening to tracks with multiple instruments, like ""Get Lucky"" by Daft Punk, ""The Dichotomy of Fame"" from the Hindi movie Rockstar, and ""Beats of Passion"" from the movie Taal at levels above 70%. However, these songs sound even better in the Electronic and Classical modes, respectively.Vocal-heavy songs like ""Iris"" by Goo Goo Dolls and ""Beat It"" or ""Smooth Criminal"" by Michael Jackson shine on the Pop preset, while tracks like ""Wish You Were Here"" by Pink Floyd, ""Staying Alive"" by Bee Gees, and ""Don’t Let Me Down"" by The Beatles, as well as a cover of ""Something About Us"" by Pomplamoose, sound better on the Rock preset.Overall, the CMF Buds Pro 2 offers decent sound dynamics and an engaging listening experience. However, the strong emphasis on bass can sometimes overshadow vocals and treble at higher volumes. Despite this, the earbuds maintain clarity without distortion, even at high, mid, and lower volume levels.The CMF Buds Pro 2 features hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC) technology that can reduce ambient noise by up to 50 dB.The ANC performs particularly well in indoor settings, effectively minimizing background chatter and low-frequency sounds from appliances. However, high-pitched noises, such as honking on busy roads, can still be heard. Even without ANC enabled, the earbuds provide a decent level of sound isolation.The Transparency mode is also effective, allowing ambient sounds to filter through when necessary. This feature was particularly useful for staying aware of our surroundings while walking, commuting, or listening to public announcements.Connectivity with the CMF Buds Pro 2 was smooth thanks to Bluetooth 5.3 support. Pairing the buds is a breeze, especially with Nothing and CMF phones.For other devices, the setup is straightforward, involving holding a button on the case to enter pairing mode. The buds maintain a stable connection within a reasonable range.The buds support dual device pairing and allow us to switch between two devices effortlessly. This feature is particularly useful as we frequently had to switch between the phone and laptop.The low latency mode, or ""low lag mode,"" is particularly useful for gaming, reducing audio lag to as low as 120ms on compatible devices.While playing games like Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) and Call of Duty with these earbuds, we were able to hear footsteps and other crucial background sounds, like gunfire and explosions, in real-time.Call quality is enhanced by Clear Voice Technology 2.0, which uses six high-definition microphones to minimise external noise during calls. In our testing, the earbuds delivered clear and crisp voice transmission, although performance may vary in extremely noisy environments.The CMF Buds Pro 2 deliver impressive battery performance, positioning them as a strong contender in their category. According to the company, these earbuds offer over 10 hours of playback with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) turned off. However, with ANC enabled, battery life drops to around 6 hours, which is still quite competitive.During our testing, these claims turned out to be nearly accurate. With ANC off, we managed to almost finish the entire second season of House of the Dragon on JioCinema. Meanwhile, with ANC on, we couldn't get through the new Shekhar Home series on the same platform.The charging case significantly extends the usage time. According to Nothing, the total battery life, including the case, offers about 40 hours with ANC off and nearly 25 hours with ANC on.For us, the earbuds went on for days and didn’t need frequent recharging when it's carried around along with the case. With ANC on, the case was able to fully recharge the earbuds more than three times, while with ANC off, the buds were juiced up nearly four times.Whenever the case recharged the earbuds, it lost nearly 30% and 20% battery life with ANC on and off, respectively.It's important to note that while the earbuds support quick charging, they do not offer wireless charging. A quick 10-minute charge gave us over 4 hours of playback with ANC on.The CMF Buds Pro 2 presents a compelling mix of features and performance at a price point of Rs 4,299. These earbuds excel in several areas, offering more than 10 hours of playback with ANC off, dual-device pairing, and a unique volume control dial integrated into the case. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is also effective, making it a solid choice for those seeking to minimise distractions.The sound quality is generally good, particularly if you prefer a bass-heavy profile. However, if a more balanced default sound profile is a priority, this might not be the right option for you.The CMF Buds Pro 2 also has a practical design. While it doesn’t support wireless charging, its fast charging capabilities ensure you’re not waiting too long. Including features like Bluetooth multipoint and a low-lag mode for gaming adds extra value.These features help the earbuds offer excellent value for money, particularly if you are seeking a decent ANC performance and a customisable listening experience. All this makes the CMF Buds Pro 2 a strong contender in the sub-Rs 5,000 segment.","The CMF Buds Pro 2 by Nothing showcases a distinctive design language.

Time travel mystery: Is the boy holding an iPad or just a notebook in a 1941 photo?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/time-travel-mystery-is-the-boy-holding-an-ipad-or-just-a-notebook-in-a-1941-photo/articleshow/113291252.cms,"Time travel or optical illusion? 1941 photo sparks debate over 'iPad' claim

Time travel: A persistent mystery

A seemingly ordinary photograph from 1941 has sparked an online frenzy, with many speculating that it could be proof of time travel . The image, captured by Edwin Rosskam on Chicago's South Side, shows a group of children queuing to enter a cinema. However, one particular detail in the photo has ignited debate.The photo, first shared on Reddit, features a young boy at the far right of the group.Social media users have focused on what the boy appears to be holding, which resembles a modern-day Apple iPad. This has raised eyebrows, considering the first iPad was only released in 2010, nearly 70 years after the photo was taken. One Redditor enthusiastically noted, “iPad-carrying movie-goer, all the way to the right,” suggesting the possibility of time travel. Another user added, “How is the first kid in line holding an Apple iPad in 1941?”While the time travel theory gained attention, not everyone is convinced. Some users argue that the object in the boy's hand is more likely a book or notepad. One commenter dismissed the theory, stating, “Looks like a book to me,” and suggesting that the object might be a notebook. Adding historical context, another user pointed out, “Back in the early film days, ushers checked for pens and notepads to prevent bootleg recordings of the film.” This implies that the boy could simply be holding a notebook.As the debate over the ‘iPad’ continued, many users took the opportunity to reflect on the fashion of the era. The children’s attire, dressed in their finest for a trip to the cinema, was admired by many. The Redditor commented, “They all are dressed so nicely. To wear your Sunday best to see the movies must have been a fantastic treat.” Another agreed, expressing a wish for a return to such formal dressing for everyday activities, noting, “The little men’s hats are so adorable.”This isn’t the first instance where old photographs have sparked time travel theories. Enthusiasts have previously pointed to images where modern technology appears out of place. A notable example is a 1943 beach photo from Cornwall, where a man seemingly holds a mobile phone, though sceptics later suggested it was a cigarette. Similarly, a 1940s photo from Reykjavik shows a man who appears to be using a mobile phone. More recently, an ancient Greek tombstone was thought to depict a laptop, fueling further speculation.Despite ongoing discussions and debates, no concrete evidence has emerged to prove that time travel is possible. While quantum physics has explored non-linear time theories, scientists have yet to confirm if these could permit travel into the past or future. For now, it appears that what we’re seeing in the photograph is likely a case of mistaken identity—a notebook or Bible held by a young boy dressed up for a cinema outing. As fascinating as these discussions are, time travel remains firmly within the realm of science fiction.","A photo from 1941 has sparked an online frenzy, with many speculating that it could be proof of time travel.

The release of Meghan’s book could further inflame tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly following the mixed reception of Harry's memoir, Spare.Bower also criticized Meghan’s acting career, remarking, “The problem is, she isn’t a great actress. Her acting career ended long before she arrived in London - that’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits.”Speculation about Meghan’s autobiography has been circulating since Harry’s book gained attention in early 2023. Some publishing experts believe it is strategic for the couple to delay further releases, as maintaining public interest is crucial. An insider noted, “Fans are fickle. Disappoint them once, and a book can freefall into irrelevance super quickly, even with the momentum of something like Spare behind it. Their team, who are good at what they do, wants to make the angry mobs salivate for it before throwing Meghan’s story to the masses because even the bad press is good press for this couple.”","Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app’s impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd’s editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app’s design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk’s social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a “dating supermarket,” these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn’t see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry’s memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry’s depiction of Kate Middleton’s supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Impact of public scrutiny

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

Former NXT Champion , Mandy Rose, gave us one of the best NXT Women’s Championship reigns of all time. She held onto the coveted title for a staggering 413 days before losing it to Roxanne Perez back in 2022. Shortly after losing her title, Mandy Rose was also fired from WWE for her FanTime content.Apparently, Rose’s content on this website was a little too adult for WWE, and they revealed that things had crossed the line.Officials have previously stated that they felt like there was no choice but to let go of Mandy due to the nature of her content. Recently, Rose revealed she still has the itch to wrestle. Let’s take a look at what she had to say during her conversation on the Power Alphas podcast:“I do have the itch a little bit, but I have a lot going on. For me, it has to make sense—emotionally, physically, not just financially. I love my current life—spending time with family, planning my wedding. Do I want to jump back into the physical toll and constant traveling?”Also Read: Mandy Rose shares her thoughts on the upcoming Netflix docuseries Mr. McMahon After being let go from WWE, Rose was free to create content to her heart’s content. Fortunately, her content has also helped her make more money than she did during her time as an active wrestler. So, while Rose may want to wrestle again, it just doesn’t make sense for her to go through everything all over again. Especially since she has been thriving outside the ring.However, fans will be happy to know that Rose hasn’t fully closed the door on returning to wrestling. Even if it is not inside the ring, there is hope that we will get to see Mandy do somethingwrestling related in the future. Rose was well on her way to being one of the top women before her WWE career came to a swift end.She should find comfort in the fact that her one and only title reign came to an end at the hands of Roxanne Perez, who has flourished into a star. Hopefully, we’ll get to see Mandy Rose take the ring at least one more time before she calls it quits for good.Also Read: “It was a big part of my life”- Former WWE Star Mandy Rose Talks About Missing Wrestling",Mandy Rose was fired from WWE for her FanTime content.
