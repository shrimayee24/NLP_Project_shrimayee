Snow, orchards, birds



-- the timeless line, attributed by many to Amir Khusrau and famously used by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, resurfaces each winter as Kashmir enters its harshest yet most enchanting period -- Chillai Kalan. And as the Valley embraces this 40-day stretch of biting cold, this Persian phrase feels more fitting.Snow-laden rooftops of the houses, frost-crusted deodar and chinar trees, Kashmiris in pherans with smoky kangris tucked insde, the Valley transforms into a scenic postcard during Chillai Kalan. Srinagar 's Jewel -- Dal Lake freezes around the edges, its shikaras scraping gently through thin sheets of ice, while cracks form over the vast span of Wular Lake in Bandipora. Migratory birds flee frostbitten homelands in Siberia, China, and Central Asia, to find refuge in Kashmir's wetlands, adding life to its winter quiet.As 2026 begins, the grandeur of the Kashmir Valley is in the grip of Chillaii-Kalan, a 40-day spell of the harshest, and the most defining phase of winter, the region experiences each year.Kashmir's winter unfolds in three distinct phases: Chillai Kalan, Chillai Khurd, and Chillai Bachha.It begins with the 40-day Chillai Kalan (December 21–January 31), the harshest period of cold. This is followed by the 20-day Chillai Khurd (January 31–February 19), or ""small cold,"" and concludes with the 10-day Chillai Bachha (February 20–March 2), or ""baby cold.""Each phase brings biting temperatures, snowfall, and frozen rivers and lakes, playing a vital role in replenishing the Valley’s water resources.The Valley takes on a new dimension of beauty under a pristine blanket of snow, with green meadows, apple orchards, and winding highways to the upper reaches of the Great Himalayas and Pir Panjal range all dusted in white.Kashmir, already one of the world's most sought-after tourist destinations, becomes even more captivating during this period. Travel enthusiasts flock to witness fresh snowfall, feel the intense winter chill, and listen to the rustle of icy winds whipping through the mountains, adding a dramatic rhythm to the serene landscape.Winter is traditionally Kashmir's most dramatic season, but this year, the Valley is witnessing a remarkable inflow of visitors. Gulmarg has been reporting almost 100% occupancy, with the Tourism Department lining up events across Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Pahalgam and Dodhpathri to meet demand.Hotels across Srinagar, Pahalgam and Gulmarg are filled for the first time in months.Altaf Ahmad, a hotel general manager in Gulmarg, told IANS: ""We are completely sold out this time.""For many locals, this winter is not just a season but the opening of opportunities to earn livelihood as Kashmir sees heavy footfall of tourists during this time.A resort owner in Pahalgam, Taufique Butt, reflects on Chillai Kalan and describes it in Kashmiri.His resort, like others in the scenic town of Pahalgam and on the banks of Lidder River, has no vacant rooms left.""Sir, the situation here is quite overwhelming. Tourists from all over India are coming to see the snow… All our hotels, resorts, and lodges are overbooked. People are arriving with online pre-bookings.""The scars of last April's terror attack in Baisaran briefly dented the tourist flow, he said, especially around Pahalgam. But Aru, Betaab and Chandanwari — the ABC of Pahalgam, which are key destinations soon triggered visitors returning in large numbers.Fresh snowfall after the New Year renewed excitement, particularly at Aru and Betaab Valley, known to many as the filming sites of Bajrangi Bhaijaan.Ujjwal Kant, visiting from Sonepur in Bihar, had just returned from skiing and gondola rides in Gulmarg when he described the mystical mornings of Chillai Kalan:He added: ""I actually came hoping to experience Chillai Kalan, and it's been unforgettable… frozen streams, quiet valleys, and almost postcard-like mornings. We had to modify our plans a bit because roads open late and highways saw traffic jam, yet that hasn't stopped tourists.""For Kashmiris, Chillai Kalan or intense winter is as much about survival as celebration. The season's snowfall replenishes the high-altitude water reservoirs that feed rivers of the Valley -- Jhelum, Indus, Chenab etc, streams and lakes through summer. This makes the daily life and survival challenging.Snow after January 30 melts too fast to serve this purpose, which is why the first snowfall of Chillai Kalan is greeted like a festival.Srinagar resident and shawl seller Shafique Chaudhary says the season brings a special kind of joy.""Chillai Kalan has really tightened its grip this year. Daily routines slow down because mornings are painfully cold and water lines freeze often. But people here are used to adjusting — we layer up, start work later, and rely more on kangris.:He added, ""The harsh cold also brings a certain calm to the city, something only winter in Kashmir can create.""He described the familiar winter scene: pherans, kangris, streets filled with bundled-up locals, and constant cups of kahwa and noon chai keeping people going.Gulfam Beigh, a Shikara operator on Dal Lake, captures the essence of winter in Srinagar through the eyes of both locals and visitors.He said, ""Chillai Kalan means fewer hours on the water because parts of Dal Lake start icing up early. But tourists still come for the experience. They’re fascinated by the thin ice sheets along the edges.""""Work is tougher -- hands go numb quickly -- yet this season has its own magic. The quietness of winter draws serious travellers,"" he added.Anantnag-based driver Mohammad Zaheer feels the winter both helps and challenges him: ""For us drivers, Chillai Kalan is both a challenge and a boost… Roads are slippery in the mornings… But tourist pickups have increased because they want to explore snow spots.""He added, ""Business stays steady, though we spend more on heaters and maintenance. The cold tests everyone, but it also brings visitors who appreciate Kashmir's winter charm.""As the bone-chilling winter descends upon the Himalayas and the 40-day Chillai Kalan grips Jammu and Kashmir , ANI sources in the defence establishment said the Army has stepped-up counterterror actions across Kishtwar and Doda districts, just south of the Valley.Undeterred by freezing temperatures, treacherous terrain, and heavy snowfall, Army units have expanded into higher, snowbound areas to pursue Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment.""This winter marks a decisive shift in operational approach,"" said a source. ""Instead of reducing activities, the Army has adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.""A key feature of this year’s counter-terror strategy is the integrated approach. The Army is leading a synchronized effort with multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the Civil Administration, Jammu and Kashmir Police, CRPF, SOG, Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards. ""This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution,"" the source added.Intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully analysed to map terrorist movements and hideouts. Once verified, coordinated operations are launched, minimising overlaps and maximising impact. About 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists are currently in the Jammu region, and intelligence suggests they have shifted to higher and mid-mountain areas, now largely uninhabited. ""These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection,"" the source said.Reports indicate remnants of these groups are attempting to coerce villagers for shelter and food, but their local support has sharply declined. Continuous security vigilance and isolation have restricted their ability to regroup or plan attacks.The Army in this winter is focused on two goals -- eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and ensure they remain limited and restricted to inhospitable high-altitude areas. ""Security forces have launched concurrent operations along valleys, mid-altitude regions, and high ridges to maintain overlapping control and deny any potential movement corridor,"" said the source. Each operation is followed by sustained surveillance, forming the ""surveillance-sweep-surveillance"" cycle, the cornerstone of the Army's new winter doctrine.Snowbound terrain makes the whole task of Army operation challenging, and it requires specialised training and equipment also. ""The Indian Army has deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat,"" the ANI source said. These troops have been crucial in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.Snowfall during Chillai Kalan delivers essential ""chilling hours"" that sustain Kashmir’s apple orchards, a backbone of its economy.And with its lakes freezing at the edges and wetlands opening up, the Valley has recorded a huge influx of migratory birds this winter, escaping harsher climates elsewhere.","Kashmir's winter unfolds in three distinct phases: Chillai Kalan, Chillai Khurd, and Chillai Bachha. The Valley takes on a new dimension of beauty under a pristine blanket of snow.

How fan pressure and MrBeast’s response shifted the spotlight





MrBeast has found himself amidst the controversy of Danielle Marsh’s sudden exit from NewJeans, which was big news in the K-pop world. The 20-year-old idol is now at the center of a legal and public battle with ADOR, the label behind NewJeans. Recently, it was reported that ADOR had ended Marsh’s exclusive contract with the label.Fans were already frustrated by earlier allegations of mistreatment, but Danielle’s departure pushed emotions even higher. In a strange set of events, fans are now clamoring for MrBeast to help in any way he can to help Marsh. Although he was curious and asked how he could help, some are using hashtags and urging MrBeast to buy NewJeans and save Danielle.The whole controversy began in 2024 when NewJeans members claimed their contracts with ADOR were no longer valid. They further accused the company of manipulation and unfair treatment. The situation further intensified in late 2025, when ADOR accused Marsh of breaching her contract by agreeing to unauthorized deals and activities.Shortly after, the company confirmed it would sue former CEO Min Hee-jin for $30 million.Amidst the backlash and concerns from fans, their focus weirdly turned towards MrBeast. Supporters flooded his TikTok and Instagram posts with pleas to help Danielle, with the hashtag “#mrbeastsavenewjeans.”On January 6, 2025, MrBeast acknowledged the pleas and responded to a post from @AniEMPIRE on X. He wrote, “What do I need to do?” Using the hashtag, fans began pushing the idea that MrBeast could somehow “buy NewJeans” or help Danielle regain her place, despite no clear path for such an intervention.X user @karinafan123412 shared a screen recording and wrote, “Tokkis are currently demanding that MrBeast - the most successful and highest-earning YouTuber right now - buy NewJeans and ‘save’ Danielle.” As of now, MrBeast has not offered any concrete involvement beyond his aforementioned comment.Also read: World's most popular YouTuber MrBeast names the best platform to build a strong creator community",Danielle Marsh’s sudden exit from NewJeans was big news in the K-pop world.

Vietnam to force YouTube and other platforms to allow skipping ads after 5 seconds starting February 15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/vietnam-to-force-youtube-and-other-platforms-to-allow-skipping-ads-after-5-seconds-starting-february-15/articleshow/126381685.cms,"Image Via ""X""

New Vietnam law requires skippable ads on YouTube and other platforms

“close”





The government of Vietnam has recently rolled out a new law known as Decree 342/2025 that forces YouTube and other digital platforms to enable users to skip video advertisements after a maximum of five seconds. According to the regulation, the law is expected to come into effect on the 15th of February 2026. The reason behind introducing this law is to protect the rights of users who find advertisements on digital platforms very frustrating due to their length.The new rule will hit video adverts that previously made viewers sit through 15 to 30 seconds without offering a skip option. It will also hit static image ads, pop-ups, and banners, which now need to be immediately closeable with a single click. Platforms will also be obliged to remove deceptive designs that dupe users into clicking adverts, ensuring all skip or close buttons are in clear sight.Under the new law, all digital platforms operating in Vietnam must give users the ability to skip or close ads within five seconds. This includes video ads, animated content, and static banners. Pop-up ads must not use fakebuttons or misleading icons. Users should be able to dismiss any ad quickly and clearly.The decree also requires that online ads include visible icons or instructions to report illegal content or opt out of certain types of ads. Advertising platforms, content providers, and publishers are responsible for removing illegal or harmful ads within 24 hours of a government request. If they fail to comply, Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications can block their content, and authorities can take further legal action. Telecommunication and internet service providers are also required to help restrict access to non-compliant ads.This is perceived as part of the efforts by the Vietnam government to ensure that the country has a much safer and friendlier digital space. These unskippable adverts have been an unpopular trend even on an international level, and this amendment has been expected to bring much-needed improvements.With the implementation of the law on February 15, 2026, YouTube and other online streaming services will have to adapt their current online ad systems to allow for compliance. Users in Vietnam will now enjoy quicker and uninterrupted online browsing as they will not have to suffer through prolonged online commercial adverts.Also Read: Twitch streamer Swifty unbanned after brief suspension, thanks fans for support",New Vietnam law requires skippable ads on YouTube and other platforms.

Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that’s what people don’t understand. That is going to be jobs left and right.”","Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions” He said that they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126352688,imgsize-29300,width-400,resizemode-4/billionaire-mark-cuban-has-a-success-tip-for-students-ai-will-help-students-think-bigger-but-it-doesn39t-.jpg"

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA later this year.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI. He believes it will reveal AI's real-world planning and decision-making prowess.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Farmers: Take immediate precautions to protect frost-sensitive crops in northern and western desert regions.

Emergency Contact: For any weather-related emergencies, residents are urged to contact the hotline at 112.





Meteorology departments across the Gulf have issued a weather alert for strong winds and significantly reduced visibility, particularly in Kuwait , with impacts likely felt in coastal and inland areas today. Officials warn that northwesterly winds exceeding 60 km/h will sweep through parts of the region, bringing dust, blowing sand, and horizontal visibility dropping below 1,000 meters in exposed spots.Kuwait is bracing for a day of turbulent weather as the Meteorological Department issues a stern warning for Monday, January 5, 2026. A powerful northwesterly wind system is set to dominate the skyline, with speeds expected to roar past 60 km/h. This isn’t just a breeze; the sheer force of the wind is predicted to kick up significant dust and sand across the country, turning the blue skies into a hazy brown.For those heading out, the impact will be immediate. Horizontal visibility is expected to plummet to less than 1,000 meters in several regions. In open desert areas and along highways, experts warn that visibility could occasionally hit zero due to sand drifting.If you are commuting between cities, expect a ""whiteout"" effect, only this time, it’s made of desert sand.Alongside strong winds, Kuwait’s Meteorological Department has also issued a cold weather warning, cautioning that minimum temperatures are expected to drop below 3°C, raising the risk of frost formation in agricultural and desert areas. The frost alert is in effect from 1:30am to 8:30am on Monday, January 5, with authorities urging farmers and residents in open areas to take precautionary measures to protect crops, livestock and outdoor equipment. The warning was issued shortly after 1:00am, highlighting a sharp overnight temperature drop.The chaos isn't limited to the land. Mariners and beachgoers are being told to stay clear of the water as the ""freshening"" northwesterly winds wreak havoc on sea conditions. The Meteorological Department has confirmed that waves in the Arabian Gulf could surge to heights of 6 to 7 feet.This ""rough to very rough"" sea state poses a significant risk to small boats and fishing vessels. Authorities have officially advised against all marine activities until the wind activity subsides. The warning is currently slated to remain in peak effect from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM, though choppy conditions may persist well into the evening.As the dust begins to settle, a different kind of weather threat is creeping in: a biting cold snap. Following the wind shift, temperatures are expected to take a dramatic dive. Forecasters have issued a rare frost warning for agricultural and desert areas, with minimum temperatures potentially dipping below 3°C.This sudden drop in mercury follows a period of relatively mild weather, making the change feel even more severe. The Ministry of Health has urged residents, especially those with respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, to stay indoors to avoid the dual threat of fine dust particles and the freezing air. For those who must go out, wearing N95 masks is highly recommended to filter out the PM2.5 pollutants carried by the wind.The Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the Meteorological Department have activated emergency protocols to manage the fallout from the shifting pressure systems. Acting Director of the Meteorology Department, Dhirar Al-Ali, stated that the country is currently under the influence of a ""deep surface low-pressure system,"" which is driving the atmospheric instability.To stay safe, authorities recommend the following:Similar conditions have appeared in recent months across the Gulf. Strong winds and blowing dust have prompted earlier warnings of reduced visibility and hazardous seas in Kuwait and neighbouring Gulf states, as noted by meteorology departments in routine forecasts.This kind of northwesterly wind pattern is common during transitional weather periods and can stir up dust storms, further robbing the air of clarity and increasing the risk of travel delays.","Strong winds, dust storms, and a sharp temperature drop are sweeping across Kuwait. Forecasters warn that northwesterly winds exceeding 60 km/h will sweep through parts of the region. Horizontal visibility is expected to plummet to less than 1,000 meters in several regions. Mariners and beachgoers are being told to stay clear of the water as the winds wreak havoc on sea conditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126345871,imgsize-14984,width-400,resizemode-4/kuwait.jpg"

Burj Khalifa’s breakthrough: Buttressed core system



Burj Khalifa’s engineering against the elements: Wind, heat, sand



Burj Khalifa’s safety, sustainability and built in innovation



Burj Khalifa: A legacy that is larger than its height







When the Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010, it did not just take the title of the world’s tallest building, it announced Dubai to the world as a hub of ambition, innovation and architectural daring. More than a decade later, architects and engineers still marvel at how it was done and how the structure continues to stand as a benchmark of engineering excellence. At the centre of that success is Bill Baker, the structural engineer whose pioneering designs made the 828-metre landmark possible.Read on as we explore the groundbreaking systems and safety features that not only helped build Burj Khalifa but keep it safe, stable and relevant in 2026, by design as much as by physics.Did you know that the original concept for the Burj Khalifa was not always as tall as it is today? The building began life planned for about 518 metres but as engineers tested and refined the design, they realised it was possible to go much higher while keeping stability and cost efficiency in check. Through iterative wind-tunnel experiments and modelling, the team increased the design by another 310 metres, roughly the height of the Eiffel Tower, without compromising safety or performance.This refinement was not just ambition, it was engineering evolution. From the outset, the project’s core team, led by Emaar Properties and coordinated with global experts, approached the build with flexibility and scientific rigour. The result is not just a taller building but a smarter one.At the heart of Burj Khalifa’s structural resilience is an innovative design known as the “buttressed core”, a concept developed by Baker and his colleagues at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). This system uses a central reinforced core shaped like an irregular hexagon, with three wings extending outward in a Y-shaped plan.For its torsional stability, the hexagonal core acts much like an axle, resisting twists and turns that wind forces cause at great heights. For wind resistance, each wing buttresses the others, distributing load evenly and making the structure incredibly stable even in strong gusts. Burj Khalifa's aerodynamic efficiency is credited to the unusual shape that helps “confuse the wind”, so vortices don’t form consistently around the surface, dramatically reducing oscillation forces.This structural system made it possible for Burj Khalifa to break previous height records by a huge margin, not incrementally but dramatically. It is a standard-setter that has since influenced other super-tall buildings around the world.Dubai’s environmental conditions presented unique challenges. With summer temperatures often exceeding 50 °C and desert winds exerting unpredictable force, the design team needed solutions on multiple fronts. For the wind tunnel testing, the team conducted over 40 wind tunnel analyses to model how the building would respond to every possible force, adjusting setbacks and facade angles accordingly.For concrete and cladding, special cladding panels (about 26,000 of them) were hand-cut to fit perfectly and minimise thermal and light stress. Ultra-reflective materials protect the structure from heat gain. For its foundations, instead of sitting directly on loose sand, Burj Khalifa rises from a reinforced concrete mat supported by deep bored piles, anchoring the entire 828-metre tower on solid ground.Beyond these classical engineering feats, modern protective technologies like cathodic corrosion protection help guard steel reinforcement in the foundation from salt-rich groundwater, ensuring a long lifespan for the structure at its base.The Burj Khalifa was designed long before “sustainability” became a global buzzword, yet some of its features anticipated today’s priorities. Its efficient skin design is such that because of its Y-plan, only one-sixth of the building’s surface is exposed to direct sunlight at any time, which reduces solar heat gain and improves cooling efficiency.For fresh water harvesting, instead of letting condensate from air-conditioning systems drain away, the building’s design captures the equivalent of 20 Olympic-size pools of water each year, which is a hidden but smart reuse strategy. For climate-responsive comforts, higher floors benefit from cooler temperatures and clearer air, making upper-level conditions surprisingly pleasant despite the desert environment.From energy efficiency to water management, Burj Khalifa’s design anticipated elements of today’s sustainability standards long before they were industry norms.Fifteen years after opening, the Burj Khalifa stands not just as an architectural icon but as a symbol of what coordinated vision and structural innovation can achieve. Bill Baker himself described the tower as a statement of optimism and ambition, which was part engineering marvel and part cultural milestone that inspires millions of visitors every year.The “Burj Effect” goes beyond tourism as properties with views of the skyscraper command premium prices and the building’s presence reshaped Dubai’s skyline and global image. For Baker and the original design team, the real reward is not just in the height record or technical achievements, it is in seeing how the building continues to stand tall, safe and relevant more than a decade after its completion.Looking ahead, experts say that Burj Khalifa’s core concepts will continue to influence future tall-building design, even as materials and technologies evolve. Baker has hinted that even taller structures, potentially breaching the kilometre mark, are possible, though they would likely require new structural systems and solutions for challenges like vertical transportation and pressure changes at extreme heights.In the meantime, Burj Khalifa remains a testament to the blend of human ambition, scientific rigour and architectural artistry. It is a building that did not just redefine Dubai but reshaped what the world believes is possible in vertical architecture.","The Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010.

Abu Dhabi Police Warn Motorists: Loud Cars Are No Longer ‘Just an Annoyance’

How to avoid penalties and stay compliant



Avoid excessive revving or loud acceleration in residential areas. Police specifically target such behaviour as disruptive.

Do not fit unauthorised modifications to engines or exhaust systems without proper approval and documentation.

Be mindful of noise levels at family campsites and sandy outskirts, where enforcement has been active.

Report genuinely disruptive vehicles through official channels to help authorities maintain peace in your neighbourhood.

Broader trend: UAE tightens traffic enforcement







Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles, issuing stern warnings and sharp penalties that are now top of mind for motorists across the emirate. As authorities push for safer, quieter streets, drivers are being reminded that excessively loud vehicles that are often the result of unauthorised modifications or reckless behaviour, can carry a hefty Dh2,000 fine and 12 black traffic points, along with other legal consequences under UAE law.The Abu Dhabi Police have publicly stressed that loud, roaring engines and other forms of disruptive driving are not just annoyances, they are public safety concerns. Noise from vehicles can disrupt residents, particularly in family neighbourhoods and sandy outskirts, causing distress to children, the elderly and individuals with medical sensitivities.This enforcement effort comes as part of a broader push to curb reckless driving, curb noise pollution and promote courteous behaviour on the roads. Officers have specifically targeted drivers, often younger motorists, operating vehicles with modified exhausts, unleashed engines or ritually revving machines in residential districts, family campsites and sandy zones near homes.Under Article 20 of the Traffic and Circulation Law, motorists who operate vehicles that cause excessive noise face a Dh2,000 fine and a deduction of 12 black points from their driving licence if found violating the law. These penalties can significantly impact a driver’s record and insurance eligibility over time.In addition to fines for noise, police are also cracking down on unauthorised modifications to engines or chassis, another major contributor to sound pollution. Drivers who make such modifications without approval may face a Dh1,000 fine, 12 traffic points and possible impoundment of their vehicle for up to 30 days under Law No. 5 of 2020. Vehicles impounded for illegal modifications can only be released after paying a Dh10,000 release fee, and if left unclaimed for three months, they may be auctioned off.Authorities have backed up these warnings with action. In a coordinated enforcement operation in Al Ain in early 2025, police seized 106 vehicles found to have excessive modifications that caused loud noise disturbances, highlighting that enforcement isn’t limited to warnings alone but includes real consequences for violators.Officials frame this crackdown as about more than just reducing noise. It is part of enhancing road safety, community wellbeing and traffic order. Loud vehicles and reckless driving habits can distract other road users, potentially increasing the risk of accidents. Noise pollution is also broadly seen as an “uncivilised behaviour” that tarnishes the image of neighbourhoods and disrupts day-to-day life.Abu Dhabi Police have actively encouraged members of the public to report noisy or disruptive vehicles by calling the emergency number (999). This community-assisted approach emphasizes that residents have a role to play in shaping safer, quieter streets.Loud cars and vehicle modifications have become increasingly popular among certain driving enthusiast groups in the UAE, especially those who enjoy customised engines and aftermarket upgrades. However, police have repeatedly reminded motorists that unauthorised enhancements that amplify noise or alter performance are against the law and subject to penalties.Online discussions from local drivers reflect mixed feelings about the enforcement. Some argue that normal engine sounds from stock vehicles should not count as violations, while others emphasize responsible driving behaviour, particularly in residential zones where noise can cause anxiety and stress.RedditIf you drive in Abu Dhabi or plan to visit from another emirate, here’s how to ensure you avoid a hefty fine and black points on your licence:Ultimately, the new enforcement marks a shift towards prioritising everyone’s right to a safe, peaceful environment. Whether you live in a bustling neighbourhood or pass through Abu Dhabi’s streets on the way to work or leisure, these rules remind drivers that personal enjoyment should never come at the expense of public safety and community harmony.As 2026 unfolds, road users in Abu Dhabi, from enthusiastic petrolheads to daily commuters, will be keen to adapt to these measures, ensuring that the emirate’s streets are not just free-flowing but also free from unnecessary noise and disruption.Abu Dhabi’s increasingly stringent approach is part of a wider UAE trend of enhancing road rules and penalties for a variety of traffic violations, from dangerous manoeuvres to excessive vehicle noise. Across the country, authorities actively use technology and patrols to enforce regulations and educate drivers on safety best practices","Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles.

Barbecue Tradition Meets a Hard Stop at Jebel Hafeet in Dubai: Here’s What’s Changed





Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise. Barbecues are now banned in several parking areas at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, one of the UAE’s most beloved mountain getaways. Visitors caught lighting up grills in prohibited spots can face fines that escalate with repeated violations, up to Dh4,000 on the third offence, as authorities clamp down on littering and misuse of the scenic site.Jebel Hafeet, with its dramatic mountain road, sprawling views and family-friendly Green Mubazzarah Park, attracts hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists each year, especially during the cooler months. However, growing concern over environmental impact and mounting waste left behind by visitors has led the Department of Municipalities and Transport and Al Ain City Municipality to take action. Multiple warning signs placed across several parking lots and popular picnic spots now clearly spell out that “barbecue/BBQ is strictly prohibited in this area. ”The penalty framework comes from Law No. 2 of 2012 concerning the Preservation of Public Appearance, Health and Tranquility in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which imposes a Dh1,000 fine for first-time non-compliance, Dh2,000 for repeated violations and Dh4,000 for subsequent offences, giving authorities a stronger tool to protect the area’s natural beauty and visitor experience.For generations, gatherings around BBQs at scenic venues like Jebel Hafeet have been a weekend staple for UAE families and friends, with visitors often packing food and grills to enjoy the cool mountain air. However, the new restrictions echo past efforts in the region to preserve sensitive outdoor sites as similar rules have been enforced at deserts and parks where litter and irresponsible fire use posed environmental and safety risks.Local social media discussions reflect mixed reactions. Some people lament the loss of a beloved tradition, while others point to the environmental cost of charcoal waste and litter left behind after picnics, noting that stricter enforcement may be necessary to safeguard delicate mountain ecosystems and keep the area inviting for future visitors.While barbecuing on Jebel Hafeet’s parking lots and roadside spots is now off-limits, authorities consistently remind residents and tourists that designated areas in public parks across Abu Dhabi, including Al Sulaimi and Al Mebrazah parks, still permit BBQ gatherings in a responsible and regulated way.In short, if you are planning a scenic winter outing to Jebel Hafeet this season, portable or personal grills need to be left at home or limited to official BBQ zones. The ban aims to balance enjoyment of the mountain’s natural charm with preserving the environment and ensuring that everyone can continue to enjoy the stunning landscape for many years to come.","Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise.

Today's UAE weather alert

Kyiv On Edge After Putin’s Kherson Revenge Warning; Ukraine Army 'Sounds Alert'

Today’s weather will be fair to partly cloudy, with humid nights and mornings increasing fog potential.

Winds are expected to be light to moderate, becoming fresh to strong over the sea, potentially lifting dust.

Sea conditions will vary from moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and slight in the Oman Sea.

Sunday, January 4 is expected to be dusty and partly cloudy with stronger northwesterly winds (up to ~50 km/h) and reduced visibility due to blowing sand and dust.

Monday and Tuesday may again see fog and mist formation at night and early morning in western internal areas.

Impact on travel

Expect horizontal visibility to drop sharply, sometimes close to zero.

Drive slower, maintain safe distances, and be prepared for sudden low-visibility pockets.

Watch for changing winds that can introduce blowing dust, especially near highways and open deserts.





If you are planning an early start this Saturday, January 3, 2026, you might want to double-check your windows first. This atmospheric ""whiteout"" isn't just a scenic morning view; it is a serious safety concern.The NCM warns that the combination of high humidity and specific pressure systems is creating the perfect recipe for dense mist. Whether you are in the heart of Dubai or commuting through the Abu Dhabi desert, the message from authorities is clear: stay alert and expect the unexpected.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather advisory for dense fog and significantly reduced visibility in parts of Dubai and some internal and coastal areas of the UAE between midnight and 10 am on January 3, 2026. Drivers and residents should brace for potentially near-zero visibility, especially during early morning travel.=Humidity levels are forecast to rise overnight, creating ideal conditions for fog and mist formation across several regions. The NCM’s alert stresses that these conditions may make driving difficult and hazardous, particularly on highways and open roads at first light.According to the NCM forecast:Looking ahead:These conditions follow past patterns where fog, mist, and dust events frequently recur in the UAE, leading to both safety alerts and traffic adjustments.Authorities are advising motorists to exercise extreme caution:Similar fog alerts have frequently prompted red and yellow warnings in previous fog events, with local police reminding drivers to follow posted speed limits and avoid distractions while navigating foggy roads.While the fog is expected to burn off by mid-morning on Saturday, the weather ""drama"" isn't over. The NCM’s five-day bulletin indicates that the UAE is entering a transition period. As the fog clears, a shift in air pressure will bring stronger northwesterly winds, reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h by Sunday.This means the ""white"" fog will likely be replaced by ""yellow"" dust clouds, further affecting visibility throughout the remainder of the weekend.

The Great Indian Kapil Show,





Indian comedy superstar Kapil Sharma is not just making audiences laugh on screen, he’s now serving up comfort food and café vibes in the Middle East. On December 31, 2025, the comedian and television personality opened Kap’s Cafe in Dubai, marking the hospitality brand’s first foray into the Middle East after earlier launching its first international location in Surrey, Canada.Kap’s Cafe Dubai is not your typical coffee spot. The interior design leans into pastel-heavy hues, muted greens and soft pinks with plush seating and statement lighting, creating a space that is both Instagram-friendly and comfortably familiar. The décor is inspired by the visual language ofthe Netflix hit hosted by Sharma that has become one of India’s most watched comedy series globally, giving fans a sense of walking into the show’s world itself.In social media clips shared by the comedian, Sharma appears smiling, greeting visitors and even serving coffee, much like a host welcoming guests into his home, fitting the café’s relaxed and “comfort first” ethos.While the full Dubai menu has not been officially launched yet, early previews suggest a selection rooted in comfort-driven café classics. Fans can likely expect a mix of Indian and Western favourites, similar to the offerings at the Canada location, including:The inclusion of jaggery-infused lime juice, in particular, gives the café a signature drink that speaks to Sharma’s roots and personal taste, making the experience feel less like a corporate chain and more like a beloved local hangout with celebrity charm.The Dubai café opened its doors from 4 pm to midnight on New Year’s Eve, positioning itself as a cosy alternative to the city’s louder nightlife and a welcoming space for Delhi-to-Dubai travellers, fans of the Netflix series and coffee lovers alike. Located in the Al Kifaf area, Kap’s Cafe joins a growing list of celebrity-linked hospitality ventures in the UAE, a market known for its diverse food scene and appetite for global flavours.Kap’s Cafe’s expansion comes amid a backdrop of challenges for the brand. Last year, the Canada location in Surrey made headlines after facing multiple shooting incidents, including three attacks over several months in 2025. Despite these setbacks, the Dubai launch demonstrates Sharma’s resilience and confidence in growing his hospitality venture internationally.The Dubai opening does not just reflect a culinary expansion, it illustrates how celebrities are blending entertainment, personal branding and lifestyle experiences. By drawing inspiration froma Netflix series that has gained traction and viewership across borders, Kap’s Cafe lets fans step into the world of their favourite comedian, turning casual dining into a form of pop-culture engagement.In a city famed for megaprojects and world-class dining, Kap’s Cafe stands out by offering a comfortable, personality-driven space that promises laughter, nostalgia and heartwarming food, all wrapped in the vibe of one of India’s most iconic comedy voices.","Kapil Sharma opened Kap's Cafe in Dubai on December 31, 2025.

"UAE Bank to end SMS OTPs for online transactions from Jan 6, switch to biometric authentication",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-bank-to-end-sms-otps-for-online-transactions-from-jan-6-switch-to-biometric-authentication/articleshow/126303573.cms,"UAE’s big banking change for online card transactions / AI Generated Image

Why are UAE banks ending SMS OTPs?

SIM-Swapping: Criminals trick mobile providers into porting your number to their SIM card, effectively ""stealing"" your identity and receiving your OTPs directly.

Phishing Scams: Fraudsters create fake websites that look exactly like your bank or a delivery service, tricking you into typing your OTP into their hands.

Interception: Advanced hackers can sometimes intercept SMS messages as they travel through the air using outdated ""SS7"" protocols.

What are in-app approvals?



The Trigger: You click ""Pay"" on a shopping website or app.

The Notification: Instead of an SMS, you’ll receive a push notification directly from your bank’s official mobile app.

The Review: When you tap the notification, the app opens to show you the exact merchant name and the amount being charged—no more ""blindly"" entering codes.

The Approval: You confirm the transaction using biometric verification (Face ID or fingerprint) or your secure Smart Pass PIN.

What does the resident need to do now?

Update your bank’s mobile app to the latest version.

Enable push notifications and biometric login in the app settings.

Log in to your account and complete any authentication setup before January 6.

Why should you act now?





If you’ve lived in the UAE for a while, the ""ping"" of an incoming SMS with a six-digit code has been the soundtrack to your online shopping. But that sound is about to become a relic of the past. Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via text message for online card payments.This isn't just a minor update; it’s a full-scale security revolution mandated by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). For years, SMS codes were the gold standard for two-factor authentication, but as hackers became more sophisticated, the ""weak links"" in the SMS system became too big to ignore.By shifting to a mobile-first approach, the UAE is positioning itself as a global leader in protecting its residents' hard-earned money.The primary reason for this change is simple: Security. While SMS is convenient, it travels over open telecommunications networks that were never designed for high-stakes banking.This made them prime targets for three specific types of fraud:According to industry reports, SMS-related fraud caused billions in global losses.In the UAE alone, scams saw a significant jump in recent years, prompting the Central Bank to issue Notice 2025/3057, which effectively bans SMS and email OTPs as a standalone security method.The future of banking in the UAE is ""In-App Authentication."" Instead of waiting for a text and manually typing in a code, the process is now much faster and more integrated. Here is what your next online purchase will look like:This ""closed-loop"" system ensures that the person approving the transaction is physically holding the trusted device. It removes the need for the telephone network entirely, which is also a massive win for travelers who often struggle to receive SMS codes while roaming.This isn’t just a technical update, it affects every resident who shops online or uses digital banking in the UAE.How to prepare:Once SMS OTPs are phased out, you won’t be able to approve online card purchases using text codes. Transactions will be declined unless verified through the bank app. This change also means that iPhone or Android users must ensure their device settings allow notifications from their bank app.If you haven’t already switched to app-based authentication, banks generally recommend doing so well before the deadline to avoid disruptions.This step is part of a larger plan led by the Central Bank of the UAE to strengthen digital banking infrastructure. Regulators have mandated that banks phase out SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, although many instituted the change early.The goal is to reduce fraud and align with global best practices, as digital fraud patterns evolve. By moving to in-app authentication with biometric verification and encrypted channels, banks aim to create a more secure, convenient and unified payment experience for customers.","Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords via text message for online card payments.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
