RFK Jr Drug Video: Did RFK jr claim heroin made him a class topper? Here's the actual fact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-rfk-jr-claim-heroin-made-him-a-class-topper-heres-the-actual-fact/articleshow/115739250.cms,"In a podcast in July, RFK Jr said how he fought his drugs addiction for 15 years.

The old video of Donald Trump's health secretary nominee RFK Jr saying that he became a topper of his class after he started doing heroin has resurfaced and gone viral. It was his appearance on the Shawn Ryan podcast in July when he was running independently for the president. ""I was at the bottom of my class. I started doing heroin, and I went to the top of my class. Suddenly I could sit still, and I could read and I could concentrate. I could listen to what people were saying,"" Kennedy Jr said.It was the same interview where Kennedy explained that he first tried LSD when he was 15, the summer his father Robert F Kennedy Sr was assassinated. After LSD, he tried heroin and cocaine and it was only after 14 years that he became sober. In the interview, however, he was not promoting drugs; he was explaining how drugs hollowed out his life and destroyed his relationships. The only good thing drugs did was to make him a star student, he said. “My mind was so restless and turbulent I could not sit still,” he said.“I would probably today be diagnosed as ADHD (Attention Deficit/ Hyperactive Disorder). I was bouncing off the walls,” he added. “So, you know, I was probably at some level medicating myself.”He said his family didn’t know about his drug use; he wrote books and went to law school at the time he was on heroin. He got arrested in 1983 for heroin possession, he said. That’s when he was “able to get sober"" after years of constantly trying to quit.“To me, the most demoralizing feature of that disease was my incapacity to keep contracts with myself. I would tell myself at 9:00 in the morning I am never going to do that again. I would believe it. I would mean it,"" Kennedy Jr said explaining his addiction. “At 4:00 in the afternoon, it was like I had no control over that person that I was going to be at 4.00, you know, when the addict would step into my head and take control.”Experts think as the health secretary, Kennedy Jr will cut prescription drugs and increase weed and psychedelics access. He has taken a strong stance against Ozempic, the viral drug for weight loss, and said Americans should focus on getting good food, three meals a day and the epidemic of obesity and diabetes will be solved.","In a podcast in July, RFK Jr said how he fought his drugs addiction for 15 years.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Unacademy CEO Gaurav Munjal recently criticized the language-learning app Duolingo in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Highlighting his personal experience with the app, Munjal shared, “A few months ago, I achieved a 100-day streak on Duolingo for Spanish. However, I still couldn’t speak or write even a few sentences in Spanish.” Using this example, he explained the motivation behind creating Airlearn , a new learning platform aimed at addressing the gaps he observed in existing language education tools.He said that the Airlearn app is a “Language Learning Product that actually helps you learn the Language instead of being a status symbol for a virtual reward which is the Streak.”He said that the first problem with Duolingo is the over simplification of the problem statement. Duolingo does not teach you basic concepts of grammar. “It just makes you do the exercises with the hope that you’ll learn them on your own.”“Whereas Airlearn’s Teaching Slides make sure that you know the Concept first. Our Users love these Slides,” he pointed.He further added “We believe that AI will change personalised tutoring. But it won’t be just about gamification or make you do exercises. It will be about teaching you like a Tutor sitting in front of you will teach. And that’s the design principle we follow while building Airlearn.”In the posts, Munjal also shared multiple screenshots of users’ reviews of Airlearn claiming “Everyday we are making more and more people switch from Duolingo to Airlearn.”Earlier this month, Munjal shared an X post where he revealed that 1 million lessons were completed on Airlearn in October this year. He said that the majority of the Users are from the US, while “Spanish and French are the most popular languages.”","Unacademy CEO Gaurav Munjal recently criticized the language-learning app Duolingo in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) Highlighting his personal experience with the app, he shared, “A few months ago, I achieved a 100-day streak on Duoingo for Spanish.

What was the issue

Here’s what Microsoft said

Microsoft has refuted allegations that it uses customer data from its Microsoft 365 applications, such as Word and Excel, to train artificial intelligence models, reports Reuters. Recently, social media users raised concerns about the company’s ""connected experiences"" feature, claiming it required users to opt out and speculating that the data might be used for AI training. Microsoft has now dismissed these claims, emphasizing its commitment to data privacy.The misunderstanding stemmed from a privacy setting in Microsoft Office that enables “optional connected experiences,” allowing features like online image searches or accessing internet-based information, as described by Microsoft. This setting, which is turned on by default, does not mention AI training in its disclosure.Additionally, a Microsoft learning document dated October 21, 2024, added to the confusion by listing various connected experiences in Office that “analyze your content” without clearly stating that it excludes training Large Language Models (LLMs).In an emailed statement to Reuters, a Microsoft spokesperson said “These claims are untrue. Microsoft does not use customer data from Microsoft 365 consumer and commercial applications to train foundational large language models”.The spokesperson further added that the ""connected experiences"" enables features such as co-authoring and cloud storage, and has no connection to how the software giant trains its large language models.Microsoft communications head, Frank Shaw, also addressed the issue on Bluesky, debunking the claims and reaffirming that customer data from Microsoft 365 applications is not used to train AI models. He said “In the M365 apps, we do not use customer data to train LLMs,” the Microsoft 365 X account said, responding to claims. ‘This setting only enables features requiring internet access like co-authoring a document’”.","Microsoft has refuted allegations that it uses customer data from its Microsoft 365 applications, such as Word and Excel, to train artificial intelligence models.

Android Auto bug affecting other apps for some users



A new Android Auto bug is reportedly adding an unexpected ""oh"" to the end of WhatsApp messages that are being read aloud. According to a report by 9to5Google, several users have reported this issue on Reddit. These users claimed to notice the extra word despite it not being present in the original message. This bug affects the functionality that reads incoming messages aloud, which is a popular feature of Android Auto.While the exact cause remains unknown, this issue was reported only by some users which suggests that not all users were affected by the bug. Also, the bug appears to be specifically affecting WhatsApp messages and has reportedly persisted for several weeks for some, the report.However, it's important to note that that bug is not affecting WhatsApp’s functionality in Android Auto, yet the bug is certainly a frustrating quirk. Google is yet to acknowledge this issue and the report also didn’t reveal any information on when a fix may become available for affected users.Another Reddit user named Grant Son shared a thread where others have complained that the bug is affecting multiple messaging apps on Android Auto. These users noted that along with WhatsApp, the bug affected other apps like Teams, Facebook, and even Google Messages.The report also didn’t mention anything about the exact cause and trigger conditions of the bug. Despite numerous user reports on Reddit, similar complaints haven't surfaced on Google's support forums, and no recordings of the bug have been shared.While mostly harmless, the bug could potentially cause issues with things like two-factor authentication codes. Until a fix is available, users can avoid the problem by waiting to check messages until after reaching their destination.","A new Android Auto bug is reportedly adding an unexpected ""oh"" to the end of WhatsApp messages that are being read aloud.

"Indonesia refuses to remove ban on iPhone 16 series; we need a ...., says industry minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indonesia-refuses-to-remove-ban-on-iphone-16-series-we-need-a-says-industry-minister/articleshow/115745203.cms,"Representative Image

Why Indonesia has banned new iPhones

Indonesia has reportedly rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles. The government is seeking further negotiations before lifting a ban on iPhone 16 sales.Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita criticized Apple's investment disparity between Indonesia and Vietnam. While Apple has poured billions into Vietnam's manufacturing facilities, its investment in Indonesia, a larger market, has been significantly less. “We want Apple to return to do business here but we need a fair resolution,” Kartasasmita said, as per a report in Bloomberg. He further added, “We want Apple to send negotiation teams to meet us.”Indonesia's ban on iPhone 16 sales stems from Apple's failure to comply with local content regulations, which require 40% of phone components to be sourced domestically. The government is pushing for increased local manufacturing and investment from tech giants like Apple.Apple's latest offer, a $100 million investment, is still considered inadequate by Indonesian officials. The government is demanding that Apple fulfill its 2023 investment pledge, provide a more substantial offer for 2024-2026, and ultimately establish a manufacturing plant in Indonesia.This isn't the first time Indonesia has taken a tough stance on foreign tech companies. The country has also banned Google Pixel phones due to similar investment issues and imposed restrictions on TikTok's shopping feature.While Apple may not be a dominant player in the Indonesian smartphone market, the country's large and growing tech-savvy population presents a significant opportunity for the company. Both parties are working towards a resolution that benefits both sides, but the future of Apple products in Indonesia remains uncertain.","Indonesia has rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles.

Some WWE stars find Hollywood success elusive. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Dave Bautista, and John Cena have transitioned from wrestling to film. However, other popular wrestlers haven't achieved the same level of movie stardom. Triple H and Hulk Hogan are examples of wrestlers who haven't made a big impact in Hollywood despite their wrestling fame.Here are five superstars whose acting career died prematurely.Triple H has maintained astonishing charm in the ring in his long illustrious career but it appears that he was never meant to be a movie star. He had numerous gigs on his plate playing heroes and villains in action films, comedies, and animated projects. However, his Hollywood career never gained any traction.Several WWE stars have attempted to transition to Hollywood, but acting isn't everyone's forte. Triple H, for instance, appeared in seven films throughout his career, including Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery, Relative Strangers, The Chaperone, and Inside Out. His most notable role was as Jarko Grimmwood in Blade: Trinity. However, most of his films failed to make a significant impact at the box office or with critics. Eventually, Triple H returned to WWE and now serves as the company's Chief Content Officer.Steve Austin, like Triple H, had a golden opportunity to transition from the wrestling ring to Hollywood. While his legendary wrestling career is undisputed, his foray into acting proved less successful. Unlike his long-time rival and occasional partner, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who continues to dominate Hollywood with blockbuster hits, Austin's film career was relatively short-lived.Despite appearing in 16 movies, Austin's performances and audience reception were not sufficient to sustain a long-lasting Hollywood career. Austin has been absent from the big screen since 2015 after appearing in Chain of Command, and Smosh: The Movie.It is quite surprising but Hogan was another WWE legend who could not make a splash at the silver screen. Despite his Hollywood Hogan gimmick’s popularity, Hollywood was not so kind to the icon who was one of the earliest propellers of the promotion that Vince McMahon made global. Sure, Hogan was a global star and many expected that he would shine in Hollywood but that was not the case.Hogan's film career, spanning various genres, failed to solidify his status as a Hollywood star. His larger-than-life wrestling persona proved to be a hindrance rather than an asset on the big screen, even during the flamboyant 80s. Today, Hogan's most significant Hollywood connection is the upcoming biopic, where Chris Hemsworth will portray the wrestling legend.Michael Gregory Mizanin, better known as The Miz has the charm of an actor but a lot is required to make it stick in the showbiz and the WWE star had something missing. Of course, The Miz has several credits to his name and he often sees himself as a Hollywood celebrity but he was far from enjoying the same fame he has in WWE.The Miz appeared in several movies, and TV shows and made cameos in different projects but none had any impact among fans. In his short acting career, some fans know The Miz for his The Marine franchise.Legend or Legend Killer, Randy Orton is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished WWE superstars on the roster who is still active in the ring. Similar to his colleagues who have tried to make his name shine under the glaring showbiz, he was far from creating a lasting impact with his acting performances.Orton made his Hollywood debut in 2011 in Michael Pavone-written and directed family comedy, That's What I Am. After that, he went on to star in action-packed movies including 12 Rounds: Reloaded, and The Condemned 2. The Viper made an appearance in the Seth Green-directed comedy drama Changeland and he has been absent from the big screen since. Orton is still active in the ring and fans apparently love him more in the ring rather than seeing him under Hollywood’s spotlight.","Some WWE stars find Hollywood success elusive.
