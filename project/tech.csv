""Beasley’s ability to stretch the floor would be invaluable for a team with two elite passers like Doncic and James.""

Theare reportedly eyeing a move to bolster their three-point shooting, withemerging as a potential target. After a tough 131-119 loss to the Utah Jazz , where the Lakers’ three-point struggles were evident despite a 40% shooting night, the team is looking to address its inconsistent deep-range efficiency. Currently ranked 17th in the league with a 36.0% three-point shooting rate, the Lakers believe Beasley could be the solution to elevate their offense.Malik Beasley, 28, is having a career-best season with the Pistons, shooting 41.8% from beyond the arc on a career-high 9.4 attempts per game. His performance has been historic, breaking the Pistons’ single-season record for three-pointers made with 212, surpassing Saddiq Bey’s previous mark of 211. Beasley demonstrated his skills in a recent 132-92 thumping of the Chicago Bulls, scoring 24 points and making seven of ten three-pointers.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ interest in Malik Beasley stems from their need for a reliable perimeter shooter to complement the playmaking of Luka Doncic and LeBron James . Both stars struggled in the loss to the Jazz, combining for eight turnovers and a -29 plus-minus rating. Adding Beasley could provide the Lakers with a consistent drive-and-kick option, enhancing their offensive versatility.Beasley, a former Laker, had a brief stint with the team during the 2022-23 season after being traded from the Jazz. While he averaged 11.1 points, his three-point shooting dipped to 35.3% in 26 games. However, his current form suggests he could offer significant improvement if he returns to Los Angeles.The guard signed a one-year, $6 million deal with the Pistons last offseason, aiming to secure a long-term contract in 2025. His breakout season has positioned him as a sought-after free agent, and the Los Angeles Lakers could make a strong push to reunite with him.

Smelling is easy, also wonderfully complex & important

Smelling is the easiest and most natural thing in the world. It creates experiences, emotions, memories and behaviours. And yet, in our age of sight and sound, scent is sidelined. The Forgotten Sense: The New Science of Smell and the Extraordinary Power of the Nose by Jonas Olofsson shows just how fundamental this capability is.For starters, humans are extraordinarily good at it, contrary to popular belief. We don’t realise this because 19th century Western scientists created an opposition between higher intellectual abilities (and associated this with white men) and the ‘lower’ sense of smell.But in fact, humans are more sensitive to odour molecules than rats (31 to 10), bats or spider monkeys (58 to 23). The only animal that beats us hollow is the dog – but we can give even dogs a run for their money, with training. Humans’ sense of smell is enhanced by the enormous capacities of the rest of their brain.Smell is an emotional time-machine, we know, calling up old memories. It can also summon up disgust like no other sense, whether to body odours or other associations with a negative charge. In fact, those who are more easily disgusted seem to have conservative or authoritarian political attitudes. It’s not surprising that racism often manifests itself in descriptions of body odour.The sense of smell works by encompassing and taking cues from other senses. If a liquid has a colour, people assume it has a smell. Smell is usually disguised as taste – ketchup and mustard taste similar if you hold your breath. Smell and taste are also very manipulable senses. Some cafes draw in customers by spreading the scent of cinnamon.Research now shows that the sense of smell is an interface where the faculties of the brain meet and collaborate. Olfactory impairment has a link with dementia and other brain diseases.For the millions who have lost their sense of smell after Covid, there is hope – the sense of smell can be trained, via steady exposure to things like rose, clove, eucalyptus and lemon. The book shows the current limits of the science on smell too; claims about pheromones and aromatherapy should be taken with caution.Olfactory processes are shaped by emotions, life experiences and cultural conventions.Our expectations are crucial. This is why an odd combination of innocuous things like vanilla ice cream with ketchup tends to repel us. Traditional smelly foods, like Sweden’s sour herring or durian in Southeast Asia, are culturally specific – those familiar with them love them, others find them unbearable.The cognitive perspective on smell can be useful in everyday life – for instance, if chocolate is your unhealthy craving, simply smelling a teaspoon of it wrapped in foil for five minutes can desensitise the brain and reduce the urge.The sense of the smell is the most ancient, but perhaps also the most refined of our senses, the book suggests. And most of us have a world of smells to discover.","The Forgotten Sense: The New Science of Smell and the Extraordinary Power of the Nose by Jonas Olofsson shows just how fundamental this capability is.

Chicago Bears’ Biggest Offseason Dilemma: Is D’Andre Swift Still Their Lead Back?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chicago-bears-biggest-offseason-dilemma-is-dandre-swift-still-their-lead-back/articleshow/118249507.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

D’Andre Swift’s Future: Starter or Rotation Player?

Swift’s performance, coupled with Johson’s intention to run the ball, has led many around the football world to speculate about upgrades — but pinpointing the location is tricky,""

The Chicago Bears enter the 2025 offseason with several pressing roster decisions, but an unexpected position has been identified as their biggest concern —running back. Most would have assumed such arrangements would be put into consideration on the offensive and defensive line front but Pro Football Focus (PFF) believes that Bears' most important decision revolves around D’Andre Swift.After signing D’Andre Swift to a three-year, $24 million deal in 2024, the Bears expected him to be a key piece of their offense. However, he struggled to consistently pick up tough yards between the tackles, leaving questions about his fitness in the system. With new head coach Ben Johnson focused on building a strong running game, the Bears now have to decide whether to stick with Swift or bring in a more physical, every-down back who better fits their vision.Given his $8.7 million dead cap hit, outright cutting Swift seems unlikely. However, that doesn’t mean he’ll remain the Bears’ top running back in 2025. Instead, it’s expected that Johnson will look for a more physical, between-the-tackles runner who would fit his ideas on offense.PFF’s Bradley Locker noted the challenges of addressing the position, writing:Free agency doesn’t provide many long-term solutions, and the only top-tier name left is an old veteran- Aaron Jones , who isn’t a logical fit for Chicago. So, the best thing the Bears can do is look for their next feature back in the 2025 NFL Draft.If the Bears seek to address the position in the draft, Day 2 looks like the sweet spot. PFF suggests North Carolina's Omarion Hampton or Iowa's Kaleb Johnson as potential second-round targets. Either one offers the downhill, bruising running style that Johnson may prefer over Swift's elusive, outside-the-tackles running.If the Bears do invest an early pick in a running back, that may signal a relatively short run for Swift as the lead back. He will only incur a $1.3 million dead cap hit should they choose to move on following 2026, so if he does not fit Johnson's long-term vision, the Bears can easily release him.While the upgrades for offensive and defensive lines remain of great importance, the running back position has emerged as a bigger question this offseason than originally expected. With Swift's future being an uncertain RB1, the incline favors a Bears key addition in the upcoming draft. This does not bode well for Swift, who may have his role reduced or might even leave; it seems Chicago's main running-back role has become vacant much sooner than anyone expected.Also Read : Chiefs are facing an identity crisis on offense, regardless of Travis Kelce mulling retirement","D’Andre Swift's future with the Chicago Bears is uncertain.

Al-Nuri Mosque: Iraq’s leaning 'hunchback' minaret rises again after years in ruins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-leaning-hunchback-minaret-rises-again-after-years-in-ruins/articleshow/117977421.cms,"The Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq, has been rebuilt, restoring its historic presence after being destroyed during ISIS rule. Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again. Now we feel safe.""","Unesco spearheaded the restoration of the Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears. The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Faith in mainstream media crashes, and faith in podcasts rises.”When asked if the media might try to elevate someone on the left as a counterpart to him, Rogan responded that attempts were already being made, but he firmly believes such efforts would ultimately fail.Curry questioned whether the media might try to elevate someone to become the ""Joe Rogan of the left."" Rogan quickly responded, ""They already are,"" but dismissed the idea, asserting it wouldn’t work. ""Let them try. It won’t work. They don’t have authenticity,"" he continued.Rogan emphasized the importance of genuineness, saying, ""When you listen to someone long enough, you see if they’re real. I don’t lie. A lot of these people are propagandists. They try to make arguments without looking at the other side. I always try to look at the other side. It’s an important quality for a person broadcasting to millions of people and also for a human being.","Rogan is known for his wide-ranging, unfiltered conversations with guests and dismissed the idea that anyone from the left could replicate his success or authenticity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Shared themes, such as objects, professions, or word families.

Wordplay or shared prefixes/suffixes.

A new puzzle is released daily at midnight.

You can play the puzzle on the New York Times website or app.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Ads in Spotify Premium a ‘glitch’

Spotify Premium users faced an unexpected issue when ads started interrupting their ad-free listening experience across platforms – Android, iOS, and the web. The problem, which sparked frustration and a flurry of feedback on Spotify’s official community forums, left many wondering if the platform had changed its policy.In a latest, the bug appears to have been fixed, allowing Spotify Premium users to once again enjoy uninterrupted, ad-free music streaming.Hey everyone, Thanks for the patience while this was being investigated! We have good news from our teams – a fix for the instances where Premium users noticed ads when listening to music has been deployed and you should notice a difference right away. It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that it is expected that both free & Premium users may still see ads when listening to podcasts.Cheers!Many Premium members reported encountering ads during their listening experience, despite their subscription's ad-free promise. Spotify responded to the issue by asking affected users to share detailed information, including their device model, OS version, app version (for non-web users), the type of ad they encountered, and any troubleshooting steps they had attempted. To further investigate, the company even requested users to submit videos of the problem, if possible, to help identify the root cause.Confirming the glitch, the company said that the appearance of ads for Premium subscribers was not intentional but rather a technical glitch.

While the US export restrictions have limited access to advanced AI training chips, DeepSeek's models focus on ""inference"" tasks, optimizing computational efficiency rather than relying solely on raw processing power. This approach enables Chinese-made AI processors to partially close the performance gap with their more powerful U.S. counterparts.Huawei, along with other Chinese AI chipmakers such as Hygon, Tencent-backed EnFlame, Tsingmicro, and Moore Threads, have recently announced support for DeepSeek models, though specific details remain limited.
