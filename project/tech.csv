"Who is Kashish Mittal? From IAS to Microsoft to AI to classical singing, the man going viral for his lyrics and LinkedIn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-kashish-mittal-from-ias-to-microsoft-to-ai-to-classical-singing-the-man-going-viral-for-his-lyrics-and-linkedin/articleshow/122899560.cms,"Kashish Mittal’s early achievements and civil services career

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana. He is an empanelled artist with ICCR and All India Radio, with his compositions reflecting a blend of spiritual depth and technical rigor. His renditions have gained widespread attention online, with many calling him a rare blend of intellect and art.In addition to his performances, Mittal’s presence on social media has contributed significantly to his viral fame in 2024 and 2025. His LinkedIn posts offer a unique blend of personal reflections, career insights, and poetic musings, resonating particularly well with a generation that values authenticity and non-traditional success stories. Screenshots of his profile and posts circulate widely, sparking conversations about breaking free from societal expectations and pursuing passion alongside professional achievement.Moreover, Mittal’s Instagram reels have garnered massive engagement. A particularly viral reel features him singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s “Unke Andaz-e-Karam,” amassing nearly 3 million views. The video captures his soulful voice and classical training in a spontaneous, relatable setting, often shared with captions reflecting the emotions of love and loss. This blend of classical artistry and modern social media appeal has cemented his status as a multi-hyphenate artist capturing the imagination of India’s youth and beyond. His journey is a reminder that it's never too late to rewrite your story and sing your own tune.","Kashish Mittal was an IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur, and now an Indian classical singer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery.

In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years.

This initiative by Dubai Police has quietly been offering meaningful benefits to motorists who consistently follow traffic laws.This article breaks down exactly how the White Points system works, who is eligible, how points are earned and redeemed, and how they can help offset penalties, all in simple terms.The White Points system was launched by Dubai Police in 2012 to motivate motorists to maintain a spotless driving record. It's not just a symbolic gesture, drivers who qualify can receive real benefits that can help them reduce penalties or avoid costs.Unlike black points, which are given for offenses, White Points reward good behaviour. Drivers who avoid traffic violations and fines for an entire calendar year can earn these points.The system is available to drivers who hold a licence issued by the Dubai Government, and it considers violations committed both in Dubai and across other Emirates.To start accumulating White Points, a driver must meet three specific conditions throughout the year:That means even small infractions, like unpaid parking meters or minor Salik toll violations, will disqualify you for that year.Drivers who meet all these requirements automatically start earning White Points, there's no need to apply or register.The system is designed to recognise consistency over time. Drivers earn 2 White Points per month, and if they maintain a clean record for the full year, they will accumulate 24 White Points in total.However, these points are not visible in real-time like black points. You can only check your White Point total after a full year has passed, and only by calling the Dubai Police’s non-emergency hotline (901) or by visiting the Dubai Police Traffic Department in person.White Points are more than just a pat on the back. They can be used once per year to offset certain penalties or fees. These are the four ways you can use them:This system becomes especially helpful for drivers who may have accumulated black points unintentionally. It can also provide relief from administrative and financial penalties in cases where the infraction is minor or borderline.If at any point during the year a violation is recorded against your licence, whether it’s a traffic violation, a Salik fine, or a parking ticket, you immediately become ineligible for White Points that year.Additionally, if a driver violates rules while using someone else’s vehicle, not only does their eligibility get cancelled, but the vehicle owner’s White Points are revoked too. This reinforces shared responsibility for road safety between drivers and vehicle owners.If you’ve already collected black points and aren’t eligible for White Points, there’s still a practical way to reduce the damage. Dubai Police offers specialised traffic training courses aimed at helping drivers regain control of their records and avoid future violations.These courses are designed to educate drivers on:If you're worried about racking up black points, especially if you fall into the 8 to 23 black point range, this program could be a crucial lifeline. By successfully completing the course, drivers can deduct up to 8 points from their record.Drivers with a valid Dubai-issued driving licence who go one full year without any traffic, Salik, or parking violations.You can earn 2 points per month, up to a total of 24 points in one year.Call Dubai Police at 901 or visit the Traffic Department after one year has passed.You can use your White Points to reduce them, or enrol in a traffic training course to remove up to 8 black points if you have between 8 and 23.","Dubai’s White Points system grants 2 points per month to drivers with no violations, totaling 24 points annually for rewards. Drivers can earn up to 24 White Points per year by not committing any traffic, Salik, or parking violations. White Points can be used to cancel up to 12 black points, a violation, or reduce impoundment penalties.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122919850,imgsize-1662480,width-400,resizemode-4/122919850.jpg"

Daytime highs are still expected to hit the high 40s in inland regions. Humidity, especially in coastal areas, will remain high in the evenings.The NCM urges people to follow official updates and stay clear of valleys and low-lying areas during rain, where water can collect quickly.

The Midday Work Ban

How Police Efforts Help Workers in the Heat





As the UAE faces scorching summer temperatures reaching nearly 45ºC, outdoor workers are at higher risk of heat-related illnesses. To help, UAE police have launched several initiatives to support laborers during this extreme heat season. From distributing free ice creams, cold drinks, and laban to handing out umbrellas, the police are taking practical steps to keep workers cool and safe.These efforts align with government measures like the midday work ban, designed to protect outdoor laborers from the hottest hours. This summer, the UAE is focused on worker safety and wellbeing in the face of intense heat.In Ajman, police officers have been distributing cold water, laban (a yogurt drink), juice, and small cups of ice cream to laborers and passersby. This simple act provides immediate comfort and relief from the heat. The initiative is part of an ongoing effort, building on last year’s campaign called ‘We Come to You, Our Summer is Cool,’ where officers visited various labor sites to support workers.In Dubai, a similar program called the ‘shade and reward’ initiative provided 300 laborers with free umbrellas. This effort took place at Al Eyas Police Point and aimed to protect workers from direct sunlight during work hours.Besides the umbrellas, authorities shared practical advice about staying hydrated, preventing heatstroke, and highlighted workers’ legal rights and available services.The UAE police have been supporting outdoor workers during summer for several years. In 2023, the ‘We Come to You, Our Summer is Cool’ campaign saw officers visiting multiple labor sites to hand out cold water, juices, and other refreshments. This helped thousands of workers stay hydrated and comfortable despite the harsh weather.In Dubai, the General Department of Human Rights at Dubai Police launched the Soqia initiative, which provided cold water and juice to over 600 workers. These ongoing efforts focus on promoting kindness and community spirit while protecting workers from heat-related illnesses.Preventing heat stress is crucial in the UAE’s extreme climate, so managing hydration, rest, and body temperature is essential to protect outdoor workers.The UAE enforces a midday work ban from June 15 to September 15. Outdoor labor is prohibited between 12:30pm and 3pm, the hottest part of the day. This policy, now in its 21st year, aims to reduce heat stress risks for workers exposed to direct sunlight. It’s a crucial step in protecting health and preventing heat-related illnesses.Police distribution of cold refreshments and umbrellas may seem small, but these gestures have real benefits. Staying hydrated and protected from the sun reduces the risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Simple acts like handing out ice cream or cold drinks provide immediate relief and show care for the wellbeing of outdoor workers. The police’s message goes beyond just handing out items, they encourage workers to stay safe, rest when needed, and protect themselves from the harsh midday sun.People can also join in by volunteering to hand out cold drinks and ice cream through the Al Freej Fridge project. It’s a community-driven effort to keep laborers cool during the harsh summer months.","UAE police distribute cold drinks, ice cream, and umbrellas to workers during extreme heat.

In 2021, UAE’s KhalifaSat even captured Love Lake from space, highlighting its striking shape and making it a must-visit landmark in Dubai’s desert.Love Lake is a human-made twin-heart-shaped lake tucked away in Dubai’s Al Qudra desert. From above, it looks like two huge hearts lying side by side, surrounded by desert sands. But it’s not just about the shape.The name “Love Lake” comes from the word “LOVE” spelled out using more than 16,000 trees and plants planted carefully around the water. This isn’t visible from the ground, you have to see it from a drone or aerial image to understand the scale.So why was it made? Simply put: to symbolize connection. Romantic love, yes, but also love for nature, peace, and open space. In a city full of fast-paced innovation, this is one of the calmest, most thoughtful places you can go.Love Lake wasn’t announced in advance. There were no press tours or grand openings.Instead, in November 2018, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, quietly posted an aerial photo of the lake on Instagram.It took people by surprise. Almost overnight, a large, heart-shaped lake had appeared in the middle of the desert, complete with walking trails, rest zones, and desert landscaping. People rushed to find it, visit it, and photograph it. And it hasn’t slowed down since.Dubai’s leaders didn’t just create Love Lake, they’ve also been personally connected to it.In 2018, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (Vice President and Ruler of Dubai) and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed (now UAE President) brought the King of Bahrain to visit Love Lake. It was a quiet but symbolic gesture, a way to show what Dubai stands for beyond skyscrapers and malls.Then in 2019, Love Lake became the setting for a surprise wedding. Sheikh Mohammed showed up unexpectedly at a group ceremony for nine Chinese couples who chose to get married by the lake. The moment was captured on video and shared by Dubai Media Office, another example of the lake’s growing cultural meaning.In 2021, something special happened. The UAE-made satellite KhalifaSat captured a detailed image of Love Lake from orbit.The photo showed the two heart-shaped lakes and the tree-lettering clearly, even from space. It wasn’t just about the image; it was a moment of pride. A quiet desert spot, built to symbolize love, had become part of the UAE’s space imagery archive.The image was later shared by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, showing how even small, symbolic landmarks can stand out on a global (or galactic) scale.So, if you’re in Dubai and want to see something different, this is it.A1. Drive to Al Qudra, about 50 km from Dubai Mall. Follow signs to “Love Lake” after you reach Al Qudra Lakes.A2. No. Swimming is not allowed. The lake is meant for walking, relaxing, photography, and outdoor picnics.A3. No shops or cafés on-site. Bring your own food, water, and supplies, especially if you’re planning to picnic or camp.","Love Lake is a heart-shaped man-made lake in Al Qudra desert, built as a tribute to love and harmony. It was revealed by Sheikh Hamdan in 2018 through a surprise Instagram post. In 2021, KhalifaSat, a UAE satellite, captured its full form from space. It offers walking paths, cycling tracks, picnic spots, and BBQ areas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122879273,imgsize-1510828,width-400,resizemode-4/122879273.jpg"
UAE banks are ditching SMS OTPs? Here’s what to know about app-based verification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-banks-are-ditching-sms-otps-heres-what-to-know-about-app-based-verification/articleshow/122873014.cms,"Mobile authentication is set to replace SMS OTPs as UAE banks tighten digital security/ Representative Image

TL;DR

UAE banks will stop using SMS and email OTPs for online and money transfer verifications

In-app authentication will be the new standard for confirming transactions

The shift begins July 25, 2025, with full rollout required by March 31, 2026

Why Is This Happening?

The Financial Threat

According to the UAE Cybersecurity Council, public sector entities face and block over 50,000 attacks daily.

As per UAE's cybersecurity officials, ransomware attacks increased by 32% in 2024.

Ransomware incidents in the UAE rose from 27 in 2023 to 34 in Jan–Nov 2024, reported by Acronis.

OTPs Are No Longer Safe

OTPs sent by SMS or email can be hijacked through phishing, SIM-swapping, or malware

Many users unknowingly hand over codes to scammers

Once stolen, attackers can quickly empty accounts or transfer money abroad

What Will Change for You?



Transactions will need in-app confirmation

When you make a payment, your bank app will ask you to approve or reject it

You must have the app installed and notifications turned on

This adds a real-time layer of security





What Banks Want Customers to Know

FAQ

1. Will SMS OTPs still work for now?

2. What happens if I lose my phone?

3. What if I don’t want to use a mobile app?





Starting Friday, July 25, 2025, banks in the UAE will begin moving away from one-time passwords (OTPs) sent via SMS or email, according to a report by Emarat Al Youm, a local news outlet. Instead, customers will need to use their bank’s mobile app to approve or reject digital transactions, both local and international.This change is being rolled out gradually across banks, and it comes from a directive issued by the Central Bank of the UAE. The final deadline for full implementation is March 31, 2026. By then, all banks must stop using SMS and email for transaction authentication.The switch is designed to improve security and reduce the risk of fraud, especially as cyberattacks on banks continue to rise. From phishing and SIM-swapping to ransomware, traditional OTP methods have become too easy for attackers to exploit.According to Emarat Al Youm, an official document circulated to banks said:“Based on instructions from the Central Bank of the UAE, please note that the receipt of one-time passwords via text messages or email will be gradually phased out. Customers can now complete electronic transactions with ease via the smart application by selecting the ‘authentication via mobile application’ feature.”OTPs will be phased out and you’ll no longer get one-time codes via SMS or email. Instead, you’ll get a push notification from your bank’s appBank officials say this is a better way to protect both users and systems. In quotes published by Emarat Al Youm, one official explained that the mobile app method lets the customer directly authorize or reject transactions, making it harder for fraud to succeed.This approach also means less reliance on networks that can be intercepted or spoofed. It adds a layer of active consent from the customer, instead of passive code entry.Yes, during the transition period. But expect them to disappear by March 2026.Notify your bank immediately. They’ll freeze app access and help you reconnect safely.Eventually, it won’t be optional.

What is Listeria





Grocery stores across seven US states have pulled tuna salad items off their shelves after fears of listeria contamination. The recall, announced by the US food and drug administration (FDA) on Monday, was linked to products supplied by Reser’s Fine Foods.The contamination was traced to breadcrumbs used in the tuna salads. No cases of illness have been reported so far.The affected items include sandwiches, croissants, snack packs and salad trays sold in Jewel-Osco outlets in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, and in Albertsons, Randalls and Tom Thumb stores in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. All the products have specific sell-by dates between 16 and 19 July.Customers have been advised to throw away or return recalled items for a full refund.Listeria is a bacteria that can cause severe illness, especially in pregnant people, the elderly, children and those with low immunity. The infection may lead to fever, nausea, diarrhoea or, in serious cases, miscarriage or stillbirth.The FDA has also asked people to clean all surfaces that may have come into contact with the products, warning that listeria can survive in cold storage like refrigerators.","The recall was linked to products supplied by Reser's Fine Foods.

Sanjai Syamaprasad, a 48-year-old Indian-origin hospital worker in Long Island, pleaded guilty to having filmed as many as 13,000 patients and staff in the restrooms by placing secret camera disguised as a smoke detector. But despite his heinous crime, he was not given jail time as he pleaded guilty.Sanjai Syamaprasad, a Brooklyn father and a former sleep tech who used to work at sleep disorder facilities, will only get five years of probation. His original plea was not guilty on five counts of unlawful surveillance and two counts of tampering with evidence, but he changed his plea.He was caught watching bathroom footage on his phone at work by his coworkers and was then fired by Northwell Sleep Disorders last year.Prosecutors seized more than 300 videos that recorded body parts of hundreds of people, but based on who they could identify, they were only able to bring charges involving five victims, including a child, CBS News reported.Sanjai installed velcro dots in nine bathrooms and used the dots to position the spy camera where it could record the shower and toilet.Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly had recommended one to three years behind bars for each count.“My reaction to five years probation is disappointment and disgust — this case deserved jail time,” she said. “What he did, the number of people he exposed — over 300 plus videos we have — and you treat that with probation? I think it’s wrong and that’s why I was recommending upstate jail time.”""This was a massive, massive violation of people's privacy and rights,"" she said, adding that the plea deal sent a wrong message.Syamaprasad worked the overnight shift at the Northwell Sleep Disorders Center in Manhasset between July 2023 and April 2024 and filmed thousands of both patients and co-workers, some multiple times — and he may have bought his first covert recording device as early as August 2022, officials said.","Sanjai Syamaprasad, a 48-year-old Indian-origin hospital worker in Long Island, pleaded guilty to having filmed as many as 13,000 patients and staff in the restrooms.

Why risk management matters for F&O traders

In India's dynamic Futures and Options (F&O) markets, managing risk is as important as identifying trading opportunities. For technical traders navigating volatility, protecting capital is crucial to ensuring long-term success. A well-planned risk management strategy helps minimize losses, control emotional decision-making, and maintain consistency—even when markets move unpredictably.While market structures and brokerages, including Angel One, have introduced several mechanisms to promote safer trading environments, individual discipline remains key. Understanding and using the right tools can empower traders to manage exposure effectively without compromising agility.Extreme volatility or low liquidity can sometimes cause unexpected price movements during order execution. To reduce the risk of unfavourable fills, brokers like Angel One have introduced Market Price Protection (MPP). Under this mechanism, instead of sending pure market orders that may execute at any price, the system automatically converts these into limit orders with a price range buffer.This adjustment helps protect traders from significantly worse prices during fast-moving or thinly traded markets, offering better control over trade execution without requiring manual intervention.Stop-loss orders are a fundamental tool in trading, designed to cap potential losses if the market moves against a position. However, not all stop-loss strategies are static. One way traders can better adapt to changing price action is through a Trailing Stop-Loss, now available on Angel One.A trailing stop-loss automatically adjusts the stop level as the market price moves in a trader’s favor. For example, in a long trade, if the price rises, the stop-loss also moves upward, locking in more favourable exit points. This dynamic method can help traders protect accumulated profits or limit losses without needing constant manual adjustments.By automating the movement of stop-loss levels, trailing stops encourage a more disciplined trading approach, removing emotional bias from exit decisions.Another practical risk management feature traders can use is Set Exit, which allows setting both stop-loss and target level from a single interface in the Positions Book. By defining these levels at the start of a trade, traders can stick to their risk-reward plans more easily.The system incorporates an OCO (One Cancels the Other) functionality—meaning that if either the stop-loss or target is triggered, the remaining order is automatically cancelled. This prevents scenarios where traders might forget to manually close the second order, reducing errors and stress during volatile periods.By streamlining the exit planning process, traders can stay focused on strategy execution while reducing manual monitoring.Risk management doesn't stop at individual trades. Traders often have a broader daily plan, setting limits for maximum acceptable loss or desired profit. However, staying disciplined can be difficult in the heat of trading.Angel One offers a Secure Exit feature that helps traders adhere to these plans. Users can set daily target thresholds across their entire portfolio. When the preset threshold is reached——all open positions are automatically squared off.This approach helps eliminate emotional decision-making, protects gains, and prevents bigger losses that could arise from overtrading. It supports a steady, methodical trading discipline aimed at long-term survival and growth in the market.Volatility in the F&O markets presents both opportunity and risk. Without proper safeguards, traders can experience sudden, large losses that are difficult to recover from. Incorporating tools like Market Price Protection, Trailing Stop-Loss, Set Exit, and Secure Exit can help technical traders manage risks at multiple levels—from individual orders to the entire portfolio.By embedding discipline directly into their trading systems, traders can reduce reliance on emotional responses and create a sustainable trading journey.","In India's dynamic Futures and Options (F&O) markets, managing risk is as important as identifying trading opportunities.

Trading in India's F&O markets demands precision, speed, and the ability to react quickly to changing market conditions. To support this, Angel One has introduced a range of web-based tools aimed at helping traders analyze, plan, and execute strategies more effectively — all while maintaining a disciplined approach to trading.Keeping a close eye on key stocks and contracts is now easier. Traders can expand their Watchlist to view detailed information such as Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices, volume, bid-ask spread, and 52-week high/low levels. Beyond monitoring, users can perform quick actions like placing buy/sell orders, viewing market depth, exploring the option chain, setting alerts, or even adding notes. The Watchlist can also be sorted, filtered, or divided into custom sections for better organization.Understanding the broader market sentiment is crucial in F&O trading. Under Angel One’s Markets section, users can now easily view changes in FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) and DII (Domestic Institutional Investors) positions across various timelines. This visibility can help traders interpret institutional activity and adjust their strategies accordingly.For options traders, seamless execution is key. Angel One’s web platform allows viewing a compact option chain alongside charts, reducing the need to toggle between multiple windows. A smaller Quick Options List is also available directly from the Watchlist, providing easy access to index option contracts when speed matters most.Serious traders often prefer an uncluttered, focused workspace. Angel One’s TradeOne setup allows users to maximize their screen space by viewing charts, positions, and trading balances all in one window. Traders can place and exit orders directly from charts, edit open orders, and track P&L without switching tabs — creating a smoother, faster trading experience.Trading doesn't end with order execution. Angel One’s platform allows users to revisit their daily, weekly, or monthly performance through the P&L (Profit and Loss) page. Traders can analyze their earnings, charges, and overall trading balance in detail, helping them refine strategies and manage risk more effectively over time.","Trading in India's F&O markets demands precision, speed, and the ability to react quickly to changing market conditions.

Options trading is a dynamic field, requiring not just quick decisions but also carefully crafted strategies to manage risk and maximize opportunities. With the increasing participation in India’s F&O markets, having the resources to plan trades has become essential for traders at all levels.One such approach is using an Options Strategy Builder — a tool designed to help beginner and intermediate F&O traders construct strategies with greater clarity and efficiency. An Options Strategy Builder on Angel One enables users to formulate multi-leg strategies by selecting contracts based on their market view, risk appetite, and target returns.Instead of executing multiple individual option orders separately, traders can combine different contracts in a basket and place them together. Whether it’s an Iron Condor, a Straddle, a Strangle, or other well-known strategies, the builder simplifies the process into a few intuitive steps.Importantly, traders can choose from predefined strategies, build custom strategies, and use strategy analysis tools such as payoff analysis graphs, Greek calculations, and strategy charts to evaluate potential outcomes and refine their approach.Traders can also simulate different market scenarios to visualize how their strategy might perform, helping them make informed decisions before placing trades.This integrated approach saves time, reduces manual errors, and allows for better planning in volatile markets.For those seeking a smoother learning curve while entering the world of strategic options trading, tools like the Options Strategy Builder available on Angel One offer a valuable advantage — making sophisticated trading setups more accessible to everyday traders.","With increasing participation in India’s F&O markets, having the resources to plan trades has become essential for traders at all levels.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Read Bill Gates complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup.
