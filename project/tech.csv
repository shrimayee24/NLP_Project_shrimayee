When and where to watch the game between Nikola Jokic’s Denver Nuggets and the Houston Rockets?



Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets is listed as “questionable”. The Nuggets (23-15) face off against the Houston Rockets (26-12) at Ball Arena on Wednesday, January 15, at 9:00 PM ET, with key injury concerns for both teams. The Nuggets are particularly impacted, with six players on the injury report, including their superstar, Nikola Jokic. The Rockets, on the other hand, have two players listed, but they too will feel the effects of missing key contributors. Nikola Jokic ’s status is especially significant for the Nuggets, as he has been a dominant force for the team. As mentioned above, the reigning NBA MVP is currently listed as ""questionable"" due to an illness, leaving his participation in the game uncertain. Jokic has been averaging an impressive 31.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game this season, making his absence a major blow to the Nuggets’ chances. In addition to Jokic, the Nuggets will also be without DaRon Holmes (Achilles) for the season and Vlatko Cancar (knee). Furthermore, Jamal Murray (knee), Aaron Gordon (calf), and Julian Strawther (knee) are all questionable, which could make the team's depth a concern for this critical matchup.Despite these injury concerns, the Denver Nuggets have been playing well recently. The Nuggets are coming off a solid 112-101 victory over the Mavericks on Sunday, with Russell Westbrook leading the charge, scoring a team-high 21 points in the win. Westbrook’s performance was a reminder of his potential to step up when needed, particularly with key players like Nikola Jokic and Murray in and out of the lineup.The Denver Nuggets will need to find a way to navigate through their injury-riddled lineup. If Jokic, Murray, or Gordon cannot go, the team will have to rely on players like Michael Porter Jr. and Westbrook to carry the load. For the Rockets, Green will need to continue his hot streak, and they’ll also need contributions from veterans like Alperen Sengun to fill the void left by Smith and Eason.Also read: Will Bronny James play against the Miami Heat tonight?

Pope Francis’ new autobiography traces roots and rise to Vatican

Pope Francis in his recently released autobiography, ""Hope: The Autobiography,"" opened up about his youth, describing himself as a ""mischievous child.""At 88, the Pope reflected on moments of mischief and regret from his childhood in Buenos Aires, admitting, ""I remember my sins and I am ashamed… I am a sinner like everyone else,"" as reported by AFP.The Pope delved into his family’s immigrant history, sharing the story of his Italian grandparents who moved to Argentina in 1929. With only third-class boat tickets, his grandmother had to hide her possessions in the lining of her jacket. He reflected on this, saying, “There’s nothing new about it. It’s a story of yesterday as much as one of today,” drawing a parallel to the ongoing struggles of migrants.He also shared his surprise at being elected Pope in 2013, admitting that he never imagined himself in this role. Reflecting on the day he was chosen, he wrote, “I had never imagined that the conclave could affect me directly, and in no way could I have thought about a name as pope.”Pope Francis, who has not watched TV since 1990 due to a vow made to the Virgen del Carmen, also revealed the small sacrifices he’s made as Pope, including missing out on watching his favourite football team, San Lorenzo.""That evening I was with my community in Buenos Aires, we were watching the TV, and a sordid scene appeared on the screen, which deeply offended me: I got up and left,"" he said.“Going out for a pizza is one of the small things that I most miss,” he added highlighting the everyday joys he once enjoyed, such as walking the streets and taking the subway.","Pope Francis has released his autobiography, ""Hope: The Autobiography"" The Pope opened up about his youth, describing himself as a ""mischievous child"" He also shared his family's immigrant history, saying, ""It's a story of yesterday as much as one of today""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117250764,imgsize-871386,width-400,resizemode-4/117250764.jpg"

She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy. You filled my life in ways you’ll never know,"" the Suits star added., the anticipated programme, launching on January 15, will showcase the Duchess sharing her expertise in cooking and gardening, the Daily Mail reported.Additionally, viewers might also have noticed a black Labrador in the brief promotional footage for Meghan's Netflix programme - Pula, who joined the family before Archie's arrival in 2019.","The Duchess of Sussex announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

TikTok , the popular social media app, will shut down its services for US users on Sunday, according to a report by The Information. The move comes as a federal ban on the app is set to take effect, unless the Supreme Court intervenes to block it.The potential shutdown would impact all US users, differing from the mandate of the law, which would only prohibit new TikTok downloads on Apple and Google app stores while allowing existing users to continue using the app for some time.Sources familiar with the matter revealed were quoted in the report claiming that users attempting to open the app will be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website containing information about the ban. Additionally, TikTok plans to provide users with the option to download their personal data, allowing them to keep a record of their information.The report, citing unnamed sources, suggests that TikTok's proactive approach aims to address the federal ban concerns and ensure users are informed about the potential shutdown.This started when the United States administration enacted legislation compelling ByteDance to choose between divesting TikTok or ceasing its operations. American authorities have claimed that TikTok enables Beijing's surveillance activities through data collection from its users whilst serving as a channel for propaganda dissemination. Both China and ByteDance have firmly rejected these accusations.A growing number of US-based social media influencers are turning towards Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social platform, as the shutdown looms.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Can sharks really disrupt the internet?

The iconic animated series The Simpsons has long fascinated fans for its uncanny ability to seemingly predict real-world events. From smartwatches to global political developments, the show’s creators have unintentionally earned a reputation as time-traveling prophets. Adding to this legacy is a bizarre new claim that has taken social media by storm. A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025. While many dismiss it as lighthearted entertainment, the rumor has sparked curiosity and humour online.The viral video, which claims to be from an episode of The Simpsons, suggests a complete internet shutdown coinciding with Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President. The video humorously attributes this global outage to a white shark chewing through an underwater cable, blending absurdity with speculation. Adding to the inaccuracies is the claim that this event aligns with Trump’s inauguration, which is officially scheduled for January 20, 2025, rather than January 16. Despite these glaring errors, the video has captivated viewers, sparking debates, memes, and jokes across platforms.The online reaction to the supposed prediction has been overwhelmingly humourous. Social media users have shared their comedic takes, with one user joking about running out of mobile data and another commenting, “If this happens, I’ll finally get a break from work-from-home!” While the majority see the claim for what it is—a fabricated tale meant for laughs—it has undeniably entertained millions. The video has also reignited discussions about how The Simpsons continues to influence pop culture through its seemingly prescient content.While the shark-chewing-cable scenario in the video adds to the absurdity of the claim, it does touch upon a real-world issue: marine life occasionally interfering with underwater internet cables. Instances of sharks and other sea creatures damaging these cables have been documented, prompting tech companies to reinforce their infrastructure. For example, Google has taken measures to wrap its undersea cables with materials similar to Kevlar, reducing the likelihood of damage caused by marine animals. However, such incidents are highly localized and unlikely to trigger a global outage.","A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025.

Why should you install Windows 11

Microsoft has announced that it will stop support for Microsoft 365 apps on Windows 10 later this year, effectively aligning the end of support for the operating system on October 14. This move is part of Microsoft’s push to encourage users to upgrade to Windows 11.“Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11,” the company stated in a blog post.While Office applications will continue to function after October 14, Microsoft warns of potential performance and reliability issues over time.At CES last week, Microsoft declared 2025 ""the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh,"" emphasizing the importance of upgrading existing Windows 10 PCs over other consumer electronics purchases.“We believe that one of the most important pieces of technology people will look to refresh in 2025 isn’t the refrigerator, the television or their mobile phone. It will be their Windows 10 PC, and they will move forward with Windows 11,” said Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft.Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 11 though it's for a limited time only. However, millions of users are unable to upgrade to Windows 11 due to its stringent hardware requirements, particularly the mandatory TPM 2.0 chip.To mitigate concerns about the end of Windows 10 support, Microsoft is offering Extended Security Updates for the first time to consumers. Consumers can purchase an extra year of updates for $30, while businesses have the option to purchase up to three years of extended support.To upgrade your Windows 10 device Via Windows Update, users must first check to see if their devices meet the minimum criteria for upgrading.Windows 10 is being retired which means there won’t be any security and performance updates, making the machine susceptible to security threats that could lead to monetary damages. Windows will be upgraded to the equivalent versions. For example, Windows Home> edition will upgrade to Windows 11 Home, while Windows 10 Pro will upgrade to Windows 11 Pro accordingly.","Microsoft has announced that it will stop support for Microsoft 365 apps on Windows 10 later this year.

Android co-founder Rich Miner has reacted to Bill Gates ' acknowledgment of Microsoft 's $400 billion mobile market failure , attributing the loss of the smartphone wars to Android largely to Gates' own decisions.""I literally helped create Android to prevent Microsoft from controlling the phone the way they did the PC - stifling innovation. So it's always funny for me to hear Gates whine about losing mobile to Android,"" Miner wrote on X (formerly), responding to Gates' comments about Microsoft's biggest mistake.Miner, who has firsthand experience with both sides of the mobile ecosystem, revealed he had concerns about Microsoft's potential monopolistic control of the mobile market while working on the first Windows Mobile phone.""I helped Orange launch the first Windows Mobile phone in 2002, the SPV. I worried MSFT might end up controlling mobile like they did the PC, I wanted something more open. So, sorry Bill, you're more responsible for loosing the $400B than you realize,"" Miner stated.His comments came after Gates admitted in an interview with Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz that Microsoft's failure to become the dominant non-Apple mobile platform was ""one of the greatest mistakes of all time."" Gates estimated this mistake cost Microsoft approximately $400 billion in potential market value, which instead went to Google's Android platform.The timing of market entry proved crucial in the mobile platform wars. While Apple launched the iPhone in June 2007 and Google's Android followed in September 2008, Microsoft didn't release Windows Phone 7 until October 2010.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

How to stay safe against Quick Call Trap scams

Never hand your phone to strangers

If you do, make the call yourself and put the call on speaker for them to talk

Check your phone’s setting regularly. Make sure any call forwarding is disabled

Never share OTPs with others

Zerodha recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) to raise awareness about a new type of scam that preys on people’s goodwill. The post explains how scammers approach unsuspecting individuals, requesting to borrow their phones under the pretense of an emergency call. It further states that the ‘simple act of kindness’ by lending your phone might seem harmless, but it can cause serious damage.“Have you ever handed over your phone to a stranger in need of “just one call”? This simple act of kindness could cost you your entire savings. From intercepting your OTPs to draining your bank accounts, scammers can cause serious damage without you even realizing it. In this video, we explain how these scammers operate, who they target, and most importantly, how you can protect yourself,” the post says.The post also has a video explaining how these scams work, identifying the common tactics scammers use, their target demographic, and the crucial steps people can take to protect themselves from falling victim. Called the ‘ Quick Call Trap ’, the scam begins when you hand over your smartphone to a stranger for a quick call. The stranger, who requested your smartphone on the pretext of emergency, then installs a suspicious app or accesses your payments apps like GPay, Paytm to get personal information. They can also change settings on your phone to forwards your calls and messages to their number.Initially, victims may not see any signs of tampering on their phone. But once these scammers have access to your calls and messages, they intercept OTPs, passwords or your personal information to make unauthorized transactions from your bank accounts. These fraudsters may also change passwords of your banking apps or social media accounts — all without the victim realizing it.The video further warns that typical targets of these scams are those who “are less comfortable with technology”.Some of the tips are:","Zerodha shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) to raise awareness about a new type of scam.

Successful tech billionaires are often admired not just for their business acumen but also for the disciplined routines they follow. Their morning habits, ranging from mindfulness practices to strategic decision-making, set the tone for their productivity and creativity. These rituals highlight the importance of aligning daily schedules with personal energy cycles, mental clarity, and physical health. Here's an in-depth look at how some of the biggest names in the tech industry begin their days, showcasing the unique approaches that have become integral to their success.As per reports, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk keeps his mornings simple, waking up around 7 a.m. He starts by checking his phone for business updates and occasionally indulging in a doughnut, though he often skips breakfast altogether. Musk values efficiency and splits his day into intervals to manage his time effectively. While his mornings are straightforward, they set the stage for the high-intensity demands of his day, allowing him to focus on critical tasks.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos prefers a relaxed start to his mornings. Without using an alarm clock, he begins the day by spending time with his family, sharing breakfast with his children and engaging in light activities such as reading the newspaper, as reported. Notably, Bezos avoids phones during these hours, emphasizing the importance of being fully present. Known for his culinary curiosity, his breakfast sometimes includes unconventional items like octopus with green garlic yogurt. Bezos has identified 10 a.m. as his peak cognitive time, reserving this period for critical decision-making and important meetings, thus optimizing his brain’s sharpest hours.Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg begins his day at 8 a.m. by checking Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp—platforms he created and continues to oversee. A fitness enthusiast, Zuckerberg has traded running for jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts, prioritizing physical activity to maintain energy and focus. He simplifies his wardrobe by wearing similar outfits daily, a strategy designed to conserve mental energy for important decisions. His approach reflects a balance of physical fitness and efficiency in daily life.Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his early rising habit, waking up as early as 3:45 a.m. He spends the first hour of his day reading hundreds of emails from customers and employees, ensuring he remains connected to his company’s ecosystem. Cook then heads to the gym for an hour-long workout, emphasizing the importance of physical health. Remarkably, he avoids checking his phone during his exercise routine, staying fully present.Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, is a believer in maximizing morning productivity. Starting his day with a shot of espresso, Altman spends his most alert hours tackling tasks that require focus. He uses a full-spectrum LED light for enhanced alertness, especially during his email catch-up sessions. While he doesn’t wake up early, Altman is mindful of his energy levels and adjusts his activities accordingly, switching tasks or taking breaks when his attention wanes. Afternoons are reserved for meetings, preserving his mornings for deep, uninterrupted work.Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel begins his mornings at 5 a.m. with a period of solitude, which he calls ""Evan time."" This includes meditation, stretching, and cardio exercises to center his mind and body. After showering and applying a turmeric and peppermint face mask, he sits down with his family for breakfast while catching up on financial news. Spiegel’s routine underscores the value of mindfulness and self-care in achieving a balanced and productive day."," Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, and others share their morning rituals.
