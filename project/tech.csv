PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""",Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

Detroit Pistons vs Milwaukee Bucks: Who has the upper hand?



Theare set to clash in a high-stakes NBA game, continuing their long-standing rivalry. This matchup offers an exciting contrast between the Bucks' powerhouse roster and the Pistons' young, energetic core.Historically, the Bucks have dominated the Pistons, especially in recent years. The two teams have faced each other 248 times in the regular season, with Milwaukee leading the series 141-107. The Bucks have also won the last six consecutive encounters, emphasizing their current supremacy over Detroit.Recent performances further highlight the Bucks' edge. In their last matchup on November 13, 2024, Milwaukee secured a 127-120 overtime victory, showcasing their resilience and depth. Meanwhile, Detroit has struggled to find consistency, with only two wins in their last five games compared to Milwaukee's three victories in the same stretch.Injury concerns are a key storyline heading into the Detroit Pistons vs. Milwaukee Bucks matchup. Both teams are grappling with unavailable players, though the severity differs.The Pistons' injury list is relatively short but notable. Bobi Klintman, drafted during the offseason, is ruled out indefinitely with a calf contusion. Head coach JB Bickerstaff mentioned that Klintman was initially expected to take ""a little bit of time"" off but later revealed the injury was more severe. Despite his absence, Klintman’s role in the rotation was limited, so his unavailability is unlikely to significantly impact the starting lineup.The Bucks, on the other hand, have a more extensive injury list, which could impact their performance. Key players include:- Khris Middleton: Still sidelined due to ongoing ankle issues, he won't feature against the Pistons.- Giannis Antetokounmpo : Listed as probable with a stomach illness, though his recent progression suggests he’ll likely play.- MarJon Beauchamp and Taurean Prince: Both players are day-to-day with hamstring and quadriceps injuries, respectively, making their availability uncertain.- Cade Cunningham: The team's leader in points and assists, Cunningham is pivotal for Detroit's offensive rhythm. His ability to penetrate defenses and create scoring opportunities will be critical.- Jalen Duren: As a rising star in the paint, Duren's rebounding and shot-blocking can counter Milwaukee's size advantage.- Giannis Antetokounmpo: The two-time MVP continues to dominate with his unmatched athleticism and scoring prowess. Expect him to exploit Detroit's defensive gaps.- Damian Lillard: Known for his clutch performances, Lillard's addition to Milwaukee has strengthened their backcourt. His three-point shooting could be a game-changer.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 The Pistons will need to rely on their youthful energy and disrupt Milwaukee Buck 's rhythm to pull off an upset. For the Bucks, maintaining their defensive discipline and leveraging their star duo of Giannis and Lillard will be key.This matchup isn't just a game; it’s another chapter in a storied rivalry, with the Pistons looking to break their losing streak and the Bucks aiming to assert their dominance further.

The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost. However, taxpayers must pay a nominal fee for a physical PAN card. Existing PAN cards remain valid even without the QR code. This article provides a detailed overview of PAN 2.0 and a step-by-step guide to applying for and receiving your PAN card digitally.Before proceeding, determine whether your PAN was issued by NSDL or UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Ltd. (UTIITSL). This information is located on the back of your PAN card.The inclusion of QR codes on PAN cards enhances security by providing a quick and reliable way to verify their authenticity. The encrypted data stored in the QR code allows authorities, banks, and other institutions to easily access and confirm the cardholder's details, ensuring protection against counterfeit or fraudulent PAN cards.According to experts, individuals with older white PAN cards or those lacking QR codes should switch to the newer version featuring a QR code. They believe the updated PAN card design, known as PAN 2.0, will help mitigate fraud risks by incorporating a QR code for faster and more efficient verification.","The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115808793,imgsize-78664,width-400,resizemode-4/115808793.jpg"

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.Following Lupo’s death in 2020, the Wales family adopted another cocker spaniel, Orla, bred by James Middleton.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

Russia on early Saturday launched the Soyuz-2.1a rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the country’s far east, placing the Kondor-FKA2 radar satellite into orbit.The satellite, equipped with advanced radar technology , is designed for all-weather, round-the-clock Earth observation. Unlike optical satellites, the Kondor-FKA series can penetrate cloud cover and operate in darkness, making them invaluable for tasks such as mapping, environmental monitoring, natural resource exploration, and guiding vessels through ice-covered routes like the Northern Sea Route during polar nights.“The second radar satellite Kondor-FKA has reached orbit! The launch systems worked as planned,” Russia's space agency Roskosmos announced.The Kondor-FKA2 was delivered to the Vostochny Cosmodrome on September 14, 2024. The satellite traveled by air and road before being prepared at the storage facility’s thermal chamber.Developed by the NPO Mashinostroyeniya design bureau, the Kondor series has seen consistent advancements since its inception. The initial satellites were launched in 2013 and 2014, while the first Kondor-FKA satellite entered orbit in 2023. The series is set to expand further, with two additional satellites under construction and the third Kondor-FKA launch scheduled for 2026.Weighing approximately 1,050 kilograms, each Kondor-FKA satellite has an operational lifespan of five years.","The Kondor-FKA2 radar satellite is designed for all-weather, round-the-clock Earth observation.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

‘Your death date’: This AI app claims can ‘predict’ when you will die,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/death-clock-ai-app-with-1-25-lakh-downloads-can-predict-date-of-your-death/articleshow/115885555.cms,"This is an AI-generated image



Death Clock gets 1.25 lakh downloads



How Death Clock predicts death

1)

Maintain a Healthy Weight

2) Regular Exercise

3)

Stop Smoking

4)

Balanced Diet

5)

Drink Less (or no) Alcohol

6) Good Sleep

7) Regular Check-ups

8) Manage Stress

9) Maintain Social Connections

10) Lifelong Learning

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

The Phoenix Suns could be looking to move on from $70 million star, Grayson Allen as they look to build a championship-caliber team before the deadline. The Suns are off to a slow start this season and are currently seventh in the West with a record of 11-8. Various reports suggest that the Suns are now looking to use Allen’s $15.6 million salary to get their hands on a potential upgrade.At the time of writing, Allen is averaging 10.9 points while playing a total of 23.1 minutes per game. His numbers are down and that can be attributed to the fact that Allen is now playing almost 10 minutes less than he was last season. As things stand, the Suns need another quality big to replace Nurkic who has also lost a step or two this season.The Phoenix Suns have Devin Booker , Kevin Durant , Bradley Beal, Jusuf Nurkic to carry the main load on offense. However, what they lack is quality defenders who can stop their opponents from having their way with the ball. There aren’t enough disruptors on the Suns’ roster and this has led to them being dominated by most teams.Grayson Allen isn’t the best defender out there but he does enough to merit more minutes on the court. But, now that the Suns are looking to trade him they need to ensure that they pick up a better defender in his stead. If they trade Allen for a worse defender Phoenix might come out of this trade looking worse than ever.The Suns have looked utterly lost since they made the NBA Finals in 2021. Now, If the management fails to make the right moves before the trade deadline, this season will also be branded a failure. Hopefully, this won’t be the case and the Suns will find an upgrade by trading Grayson Allen. Who do you think the Suns should trade in place of Allen? Let us know in the comments below.","The Phoenix Suns could be looking to move on from $70 million star, Grayson Allen.
