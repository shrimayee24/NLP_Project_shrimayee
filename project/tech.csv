How to Get Mending in Minecraft

How To Get MENDING In Minecraft 2025! (EASY Tutorial!)

Trading with Librarian Villagers: Locate or create a village and assign a lectern to a villager to turn them into a librarian.

Continuously replace the lectern to refresh the librarian's trade offers until Mending appears.

In versions with the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment enabled, only swamp biome librarians at the master level offer Mending books. Fishing: Use a fishing rod to fish in any body of water.

There is a small chance to catch an enchanted book with Mending, though this method is time-consuming and relies heavily on luck. Looting Chests in Generated Structures: Explore structures such as jungle temples, strongholds, and ancient cities.

These locations have chests that may contain enchanted books, including Mending. Raid Drops (Bedrock Edition only): Participate in village raids, where defeating certain enemies may yield enchanted books as drops.

Mending is a type of enchantment in Minecraft that allows players to repair their tools, weapons, and armor using experience points. When a player adds or gets a mending enchanted tool and equips it while collecting XP, then the item automatically regains health/durability, making it last longer and reducing the need for manual repairs. Mending enchantment is usually made on rare and high-tier items in Minecraft since they are very valuable.It is considered a treasure enchantment since it cannot be obtained from a regular enchanting table. Instead, players have to acquire it through various methods like trading, fishing, etc.To find and acquire the mending enchantment in Minecraft requires a strategic approach, as it is not available through easy modes and conventional ways of enchanting.Here are the following primary methods through which players can obtain mending in Minecraft:Once the player obtains a Mending book, it can be applied to the desired item through using an anvil. Combining mending books with tools, weapons, and armor pieces will add mending. It can only be used once, and it is incompatible with the Infinity enchantment. Which means both of them cannot be applied to the same item.In Minecraft there are many enchantments available, and mending is one of them. Its unique ability to repair items through collecting XP makes it very famous and a must-have enchantment in Minecraft. Finding mending requires effort through trading, fishing, or exploring specific structures, but the reward is very beneficial, which justifies the hard work behind acquiring it.","Mending is a type of enchantment in Minecraft that allows players to repair their tools, weapons, and armor using experience points.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations today for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console, offering select customers a chance to secure the device ahead of its June 5 launch. The My Nintendo Store is prioritizing invites to accounts with 12-month Nintendo Online subscriptions and at least 50 hours of playtime on the original Switch. Invitations will continue to be sent through May 12 while supplies last, with recipients given 72 hours to finalize their purchase.Pre-order access also includes exclusive accessories like the limited Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube controller , which will become available to all Nintendo Online subscribers starting May 13, if stock remains.The Demand will significantly outpace supply, with Nintendo expecting to sell 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Earlier pre-order opportunities at major retailers like GameStop, Walmart, and Best Buy sold out within minutes when they launched on April 24.Adding to consumer urgency, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently warned that the console's $449 price tag could increase due to President Trump's tariff policies. ""Our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost when determining sales prices in any country or region and to incorporate them into the price,"" Furukawa stated during an earnings call.The Switch 2 will retail for $449 for the standalone console or $499 bundled with Mario Kart World. Technical specifications include 1080p resolution in handheld mode and 4K when docked, with 256GB internal storage expandable via microSD Express cards.For those who missed retailer pre-orders, checking the My Nintendo Store regularly through May 12 is recommended, as some eligible customers may receive invitations without email notifications.","Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console today.

Sam Altman’s World Project turns Black Mirror tech into reality in six US cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altmans-world-project-turns-black-mirror-tech-into-reality-in-six-us-cities/articleshow/121022857.cms,"OpenAI's Sam Altman launched the World Project in the US on May 1, 2025, aiming to revolutionize digital identity verification using eye-scanning Orbs. This initiative seeks to create a secure, decentralized system distinguishing humans from AI. The Orb scans irises, generating encrypted IrisCodes stored on a blockchain. In exchange for participation, users receive 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens.

World ID and Match Group partner to combat online dating fraud

Addressing privacy concerns and ethical challenges

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and digital technologies has brought both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in verifying online identities. In response to this, Sam Altman , the visionary co-founder of OpenAI, has introduced his latest ambitious endeavor, the World Project , in the United States. Previously known as Worldcoin, this initiative aims to revolutionize digital identity verification using biometric data, specifically through eye-scanning technology .The project, co-developed by Tools for Humanity, seeks to create a global, secure, and decentralized identity system that can differentiate humans from AI bots in an increasingly digital world. As the World Project officially launched in six US cities on May 1, 2025, it marked a significant step toward transforming online authentication and digital trust.The World Project is driven by a bold vision: to establish a universally accessible digital identity system that safeguards individual privacy while ensuring secure interactions online. The core technology behind this initiative is the Orb, a sleek, silver sphere designed to scan and encode a user’s unique iris pattern into an encrypted IrisCode. Unlike traditional username and password systems, which are vulnerable to hacking and phishing, the World ID offers a more secure alternative by using biometric data that cannot be easily replicated.Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World Project, was co-founded by Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania. Their mission is to build a decentralized identity platform that can serve as a foundational layer for the digital economy, reducing fraud and restoring trust in online interactions. The World ID system promises to be a critical tool in combating the rise of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and bot-driven misinformation.The Orb is a key component of the World Project’s identity verification system. It captures a user’s iris pattern, transforming it into a unique IrisCode that is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. This approach offers significant security advantages:In the US, the initial rollout includes 7,500 Orbs deployed across six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The company plans to quadruple its global hardware footprint by the end of 2025, further expanding the availability of World IDs.To encourage early adoption, the World Project offers users 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for participating in the iris-scanning process. These tokens, part of the broader World ecosystem, can be used for online transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and digital identity verification.In addition to the Orb, the World Project is set to launch the World Card, a crypto-linked debit card developed in partnership with Visa. This card will allow users to spend their WLD tokens at any location that accepts Visa, bridging the gap between the digital and physical economies. This integration marks a significant step toward making digital currencies more practical and widely accepted.The US launch of the World Project comes with several high-profile partnerships aimed at integrating World ID into mainstream applications. Notably, Match Group, the parent company of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, is piloting World ID for identity verification on Tinder in Japan. This move is intended to reduce catfishing and online fraud by ensuring that users are verified humans. If successful, this technology could extend to other dating platforms, enhancing user trust and safety.Despite its ambitious goals, the World Project faces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and data security. Critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of incentivizing biometric data collection with cryptocurrency rewards. Reports of coercion by Orb operators in some regions and the emergence of a black market for iris data have further complicated the project’s public perception.To address these concerns, the World Project has emphasized its commitment to transparency and data protection. The company claims that it does not store actual iris images and that its blockchain-based approach ensures that no single entity can control or misuse the data. Nevertheless, building public trust will be a critical factor in the project’s long-term success.","OpenAI's Sam Altman launched the World Project in the US on May 1, 2025.

How Bane Elevates the Lakers’ Title Chances

After a disappointing first-round playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves, theface tough decisions this offseason. The front office may explore trades to strengthen the roster aroundand LeBron James . One potential move? A blockbuster swap sending Reaves to Memphis for sharpshooting guard Desmond Bane .(Disclaimer: The information and analysis presented in this article are based on current speculations.While the details are sourced from credible insights, it’s important to note that these are not confirmed moves or official statements. Readers are encouraged to take this analysis with a grain of salt and stay tuned for official updates as the offseason unfolds.)The Los Angeles Lakers ’ backcourt needs an upgrade, especially in scoring efficiency and defense. While Reaves is a solid playmaker, his role diminishes alongside two elite facilitators like Doncic and James.Key reasons to trade Reaves (according NBA analyst Dean Simon):- Redundant Playmaking: With Doncic and James handling most playmaking duties, Reaves’ skills aren’t fully utilized.- Defensive Limitations: Reaves struggles against elite guards, while Bane has shown defensive growth.- Need for Reliable Shooting: Desmond Bane’s elite three-point shooting (39.2% career) fits better alongside two ball-dominant stars.As Dean Simon of the Sporting News notes in the original article: ""Instead of trotting out another floor general that takes pick-and-roll possessions out of Doncic and James' hands, you replace that with a reactionary scorer that can knock down catch-and-shoot threes.""Desmond Bane, who signed a $197 million extension with Memphis, has developed into one of the league’s most efficient scorers. His 2024-25 stats showcase his all-around growth:Beyond scoring, Desmond Bane’s improved playmaking (5.3 assists per game) and defense (113 defensive rating) make him an ideal third option. His ability to play off-ball and stretch the floor would give Doncic and James more spacing.For this deal to work, the Los Angeles Lakers would likely need to include additional assets:- Desmond Bane- Austin Reaves- Rui Hachimura- Shake MiltonThis trade gives Memphis a younger core piece in Reaves, while the Lakers get a proven scorer who fits their timeline.Adding Bane would address multiple weaknesses (according to Dean Simon):- Elite Three-Point Shooting: Provides much-needed spacing for Doncic and James.- Secondary Playmaking: Can initiate offense when needed.- Defensive Upgrade: His size (6’5”) and improved steals (1.2 per game) help against elite guards.With Bane, the Lakers could realistically compete in a stacked Western Conference. His ability to score efficiently without dominating the ball makes him an ideal fit alongside two superstars.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could re-sign $18,001,011 Charlotte Hornets center, fixing Luka Doncic's biggest weakness after playoff disaster If the Los Angeles Lakers want to maximize their championship window, trading Reaves for Bane is a move worth exploring. Memphis gets a promising young guard, while Los Angeles adds a polished scorer who complements their stars perfectly. As the offseason unfolds, this could be the deal that reshapes the Lakers’ future.",The Los Angeles Lakers are considering trading Austin Reaves to the Memphis Grizzlies for Desmond Bane.

A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.he four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

A striking 12-foot bronze statue of a fictional Black woman now stands in New York’s Times Square, provoking fierce debate and widespread commentary online. Unveiled on April 29 and set to remain until June 17, the sculpture, titled Grounded in the Stars , depicts a young woman in everyday attire—braided hair, T-shirt, and trousers—with a calm yet assertive stance. Its creator, British artist Thomas J Price , says the piece aims to challenge traditional ideas of monumentality while encouraging viewers to reflect on representation, identity, and shared humanity.The piece sparked controversy almost immediately. While some praised its symbolic significance, others mocked its appearance and accused it of reinforcing negative stereotypes. Critics on social media questioned its aesthetic value and even challenged Price’s reference to Michelangelo’s David, calling the comparison exaggerated. One user described the figure as looking more like a caricature than an empowering presence.Others saw political undertones, claiming the statue served more to provoke than to inspire.Price, who also debuted animated video works from his Man Series on Times Square billboards as part of the Midnight Moment programme, has long been known for using public art to challenge dominant narratives. He insists his intention is not to glorify one figure but to broaden public understanding of whose stories deserve representation.According to his team, the work “offers a unique opportunity to experience Times Square in a new light and share a moment of personal reflection amidst the district’s hyperactivity. ”Born in 1981; lives and works in London.Studied at Chelsea College of Art and the Royal College of Art.Known for large-scale sculptures that explore representation and challenge traditional monumentality.Uses a hybrid of traditional sculpting and digital techniques to create fictional characters.Received the Arts Council England Helen Chadwick Fellowship in 2009.His work spans multiple disciplines, including sculpture, film, performance, and animation.Held solo exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery, Royal Academy of Arts, and Yorkshire Sculpture Park.Created the UK’s first permanent public sculptures to honour the Windrush generation (unveiled 2022).His sculptures feature in global collections such as the Government Art Collection (UK) and the Donum Estate (USA).","The 12-foot bronze statue of a fictional Black woman now stands in New York’s Times Square.

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Fans raise eyebrows over Julia Roberts’ animated interaction with Travis Kelce

Supporters rush to Julia Roberts’ defense, calling backlash unnecessary

Public interactions under the microscope in the age of viral media

In a surprising turn of events last year, Hollywood superstar Julia Roberts found herself at the center of controversy after a light-hearted interaction with Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce. What was meant to be a fun and friendly moment during a high-profile event quickly snowballed into a viral topic across social media, igniting a wave of backlash from fans.The moment unfolded during a public event where both Roberts and Kelce were present.In a brief clip that made its rounds on the internet, Roberts appeared cheerful and animated while engaging with Kelce, placing her hand on his chest and laughing openly. Though the exchange seemed innocent and in good spirits, it sparked an unexpected reaction online.Some fans were quick to criticize the interaction as being overly familiar, especially given Roberts’ age and Kelce’s public relationship with pop icon Taylor Swift at the time. Critics labeled the moment as “awkward” and “cringe,” with several social media users suggesting that Roberts had overstepped a boundary. One user commented, “Why is she touching him like that? This is weird,” while another wrote, “It’s giving desperate aunt energy.”While the criticism gained traction, it also stirred up a wave of support for Roberts. Many fans and fellow celebrities defended her, arguing that the backlash was overblown and rooted in ageist and sexist double standards. “Julia was just being friendly. This outrage is ridiculous,” wrote one supporter on X (formerly Twitter). Another added, “If the roles were reversed, would we even be talking about this?”Julia Roberts, known for her grace and poise, did not respond publicly to the online chatter, maintaining her reputation for staying above controversy. Likewise, Kelce remained silent, allowing the buzz to fade on its own.This incident is a clear reflection of how even seemingly harmless interactions can be misinterpreted in today’s media landscape. Celebrities are constantly under scrutiny, and spontaneous moments often become fodder for debate. The Roberts-Kelce encounter, despite its light-hearted nature, served as a reminder of the fine line public figures must walk between being personable and being perceived.Also Read: Travis and Jason Kelce could make history as the first NFL stars to win a major entertainment award While the dust has since settled, the viral moment remains a talking point about celebrity culture, public perception, and how quickly narratives can shift online.","Julia Roberts' light-hearted interaction with NFL star Travis Kelce sparked controversy.
