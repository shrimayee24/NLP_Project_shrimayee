Aaron Rodgers to Steelers? Deal Likely but Time May Be Running Out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-nears-steelers-move-but-pittsburgh-may-have-waited-too-long-to-seal-the-deal/articleshow/121528413.cms,"Aaron Rodgers ready to choose Steelers as next team but timing may ruin Pittsburgh’s chances (Getty Images)

Steelers could land Aaron Rodgers soon but a crucial delay might cost them everything

Is waiting for Aaron Rodgers setting the Pittsburgh Steelers back? | SPEAK





As NFL fans brace for what feels like a defining chapter in the twilight of Aaron Rodgers' career, all eyes are on the Pittsburgh Steelers. While no official contract has been signed, the consensus among insiders leans heavily toward one outcome—Rodgers suiting up in black and gold this season. And if Friday’s episode of The Pat McAfee Show is anything to go by, that sentiment is quickly turning into certainty.NFL insider Ian Rapoport appeared on the show and reaffirmed his belief that Aaron Rodgers' next destination is Pittsburgh. “I will say it again. I will be surprised if it’s not Aaron Rodgers... To me, that is what makes sense,” Rapoport declared, pointing out the Steelers' cautious but intentional handling of the situation. They haven’t made any splashy quarterback moves, and their silence speaks volumes.The Steelers are, by all accounts, treating Rodgers with the deference of a legend. They're giving him space, allowing him time, and offering the freedom to decide on his own terms. “There really is a ton of time before the season starts,” Rapoport added. “So, there’s some time.”That time, however, may be running out. The next milestone in the Steelers’ offseason calendar is mandatory minicamp, slated for June 10–12.While veteran quarterbacks often delay arrivals—Brett Favre famously joined the Vikings just before training camp—there’s a growing sense of urgency for a definitive answer.Rodgers himself has only vaguely acknowledged the situation, citing personal matters, including health battles within his close circle. Yet, he recently teased fans by suggesting he “might play against the Chicago Bears,” a cryptic statement that hinted more at intent than commitment.Still, his recent trajectory has left fans and franchises alike uncertain. Rodgers' last season in Green Bay ended in disappointment, followed by a Jets stint that started with a torn Achilles just four plays in. Despite the buzz, his return to elite form remains a big question mark.Tom Pelissero of NFL Network recently voiced concerns about how long the Steelers are willing to wait. “There is gonna come a time where there is so much time lost, does it make sense for the Steelers... There’s all these signs that he's coming, but he has not affirmatively said, 'Hey, June 9th, book me the ticket.'” That hesitation is starting to gnaw at a franchise not known for playing games in the offseason.At 41, Rodgers is no longer a long-term investment. But his star power, leadership, and playoff experience offer the kind of upside Pittsburgh could use to ignite a new era. The bigger question now isn’t whether Rodgers will join the Steelers—it’s whether both sides are ready to commit before the clock runs out.Also Read: Taylor Swift just bought her masters back—Travis Kelce’s reaction proves he’s her biggest supporter yet","NFL insider Ian Rapoport says he won't be surprised if Aaron Rodgers signs with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Luka Doncic's donation restores defaced 'Mambas Forever' mural





Luka Doncic showed his support by spending $5,000 to restore a vandalized mural. The mural, “Mambas Forever,” at 14th and Main streets in downtown Los Angeles was spoiled with graffiti and Doncic expressed his anger and had the artwork repaired quickly. The donation not only paid for the restoration but also showed how much he respects Bryant and wants to help the Los Angeles community.The ""Mambas Forever"" mural, crafted by artist Louie Palsino (known as Sloe Motions) back in 2020, became a beloved homage after the tragic passing of Kobe and Gianna Bryant in a helicopter crash. The piece illustrated Kobe in his Lakers uniform, tenderly holding Gianna, who was grasping a basketball, with the words ""Mambas Forever"" painted in purple and gold. The mural had been left alone until it was recently marred by black and white graffiti, covering much of the original design. In response, Palsino initiated a GoFundMe campaign to raise $5,000 for its restoration. Doncic's quick donation took care of the entire sum, allowing restoration efforts to kick off immediately.Having joined the Lakers less than three months ago from the Dallas Mavericks, Doncic voiced his strong admiration for Bryant.""Kobe is L.A. He and Gigi mean so much to this city, to the Lakers organization, and to me personally,"" Doncic stated. ""I'm happy to do anything to help make sure he and his daughter are honored.""Artist Louie Palsino showed appreciation for Doncic's backing, saying, ""I'd like to say thank you to Luka, and I'm proud he is a Laker now and representing Los Angeles. I know Kobe is proud.""Also Read: “Poor sportsmanship” — John Mellencamp criticizes Pat McAfee’s Knicks celebrity booing at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on May 27 Donating to fix the “Mambas Forever” mural, Luka Doncic shows both his respect for Kobe and Gianna Bryant and his dedication to helping LA.Because of his commitment, this tribute lives on for fans, connecting him even more closely with people in LA who treasure the Bryants’ impact.","Luka Doncic donated $5,000 to restore a vandalized mural.

She added, ""I wish to help othersusing my voice.""Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union have always backed Zaya. Love, parenting, and shared learning are topics they cover candidly. Gabrielle told Time Magazine in June 2024, ""This family rests on love. Nothing can change that.The family is aware that college life will be fresh and demanding. Still, Zaya is ready. She has had so much already. Her narrative includes more than merely handling health and attaining notoriety. Being tough, courageous, and prepared for what follows is all about it.Her path ahead is clear as Zaya enters adulthood thanks to her persistent will and the steadfast support of her family.

Understanding AC condensate water

What is AC condensate water?

Is condensate water pure?

Dust and dirt on the coils

Algae or mold in the drainage system

Metal traces from corroded components (aluminum, copper)

Air pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Why do inverter batteries need distilled water?

Free from minerals and impurities

Non-conductive, preventing short circuits

Neutral in pH, avoiding chemical imbalance in the battery

Can you use AC condensate water in inverter batteries

Theoretical possibility vs. practical risk

It has no added salts

It originates from atmospheric water vapor

It’s free and readily available

Risks of using AC condensate water in batteries

1. Presence of heavy metals and ions

Zinc, copper, and aluminum particles from AC coils

Traces of refrigerants in older or leaking systems

Corrosion by-products from drainage lines

Plate corrosion

Sediment formation

Shortened battery life

2. Microbial contamination

Increase internal resistance

Validated for pH and conductivity

With rising temperatures and increasing dependence on air conditioners, many households and businesses are noticing a side effect of cooling—the consistent dripping of water from AC discharge pipes. This water, known as condensate water, is the byproduct of the air conditioning process where moisture from humid air condenses on the evaporator coils and is expelled through a drain pipe. Given its clean appearance, many people wonder: can this water be reused—particularly for inverter batteries that require distilled water for maintenance?In a time of growing water scarcity and rising electricity needs, especially in tropical regions, reusing resources like condensate water seems like an eco-conscious choice. However, using AC condensate water in inverter batteries is not a straightforward decision. There are technical, chemical, and practical factors to consider.Air conditioners cool air by passing it over cold evaporator coils. As warm, moist air hits these coils, moisture condenses into water—much like how water forms on a cold glass on a humid day. This condensed moisture then collects in a tray and is discharged through a drain line.While condensate water originates from atmospheric moisture, it is not guaranteed to be chemically pure. Factors affecting its purity include:Therefore, although it may appear clear, AC discharge water can contain impurities, including bacteria and metal ions.Most lead-acid inverter batteries rely on electrolyte levels (a mix of sulfuric acid and water) to function correctly. Over time, water in the electrolyte evaporates, and users need to refill it periodically.Distilled water is used because it is:Using anything other than distilled water can damage the battery plates, reduce its lifespan, and even cause dangerous chemical reactions.At first glance, AC condensate water may seem like a good substitute for distilled water because:However, scientific and engineering experts warn against its direct use for several reasons.Even though it comes from air, condensate water can absorb:These contaminants can interfere with the chemical reaction inside a battery, leading to:Stagnant water in drain pipes can breed algae, bacteria, and mold, which may introduce biological contaminants into the battery.This can:Condensate water may have a slightly acidic or alkaline pH, depending on environmental factors. This imbalance can disrupt the electrochemical stability of the battery electrolyte.Distilled water sold for battery use is subject to stringent quality controls. AC discharge water, however, is not regulated, tested, or certified for battery use.If you’re interested in using AC water for other purposes, here are recommended safe uses:If you’re adamant about using it for batteries, it must be:Even then, results are not guaranteed, and risk remains high without lab-grade testing.","Air conditioners cool air by passing it over cold evaporator coils.

NYT Connections is back with another puzzle. If you are scratching your head trying to figure out today’s NYT Connections puzzle, you are not alone. The popular New York Times word game has become a daily ritual for fans of quick-thinking and pattern-spotting. Today’s challenge for 30 May 2025 comes with its own twists, but worry not – we have gathered all the clues, solutions and explanations you need to solve it. Whether you are a first-time player or on a winning streak, this guide will walk you through how to play, hints for today’s groups, the correct answers and their connections.NYT Connections is a daily word puzzle game offered by The New York Times . It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 seemingly unrelated words. The goal is to organise them into four groups of four words that are connected by a common theme or idea. These themes can range from synonyms and item categories to clever wordplay and pop culture references. The game tests not just vocabulary, but lateral thinking as well.Playing Connections is simple but tricky. You start with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to group the words into four sets of four that share a common link. These links can be literal, metaphorical, or based on word associations. Once you select a group of four words, hit the 'Submit' button. If correct, that group is removed from the board. You only get four chances to make mistakes, so choose wisely. The four categories are colour-coded by difficulty: yellow (easiest), green, blue, and purple (hardest).To help you solve today’s puzzle, here are the theme hints for each of the four groups:Yellow group – Rods: BAT, CLUB, STAFF, STICKGreen group – They’re on a roll!: FOIL, RIBBON, TAPE, TOILET PAPERBlue group – Common swag items: HAT, TEE, TOTE, WATER BOTTLEPurple group – Words before ""shack"": CADDY, LOVE, RADIO, SHAKEThe yellow group contains items that are types of rods or handheld sticks, such as a bat for baseball or a staff often used in hiking or fantasy tales.The green group are all objects that are typically rolled up. Toilet paper, foil, ribbon, and tape are all stored and dispensed from rolls, making the connection logical and physical.The blue group includes popular promotional items. If you've attended any conference or corporate event, you’ve likely come home with a hat, tee, tote bag, or water bottle emblazoned with a company logo.The purple group is a fun wordplay category. Each word can be paired with “shack” to form a well-known term or brand: Caddyshack (film), Love Shack (song by The B-52’s), RadioShack (retail chain), and Shake Shack (restaurant chain).Today’s puzzle was a satisfying mix of straightforward connections and clever wordplay. The trickiest part was arguably the purple group, but once “Radio” and “Shake” were spotted, the pattern clicked into place. Whether you solved it quickly or needed some nudges, remember each day brings a new challenge. Come back tomorrow for another round of mental gymnastics. Happy Connection!",NYT Connections is a daily word puzzle game offered by The New York Times. It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 seemingly unrelated words.

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected



iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s “About Us” page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, a report claims.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

St. Clair sues Musk over child support, alleged ghosting

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a virtual appearance during a private hearing in a paternity and custody case filed by Ashley St. Clair on Thursday, May 29. The conservative influencer, who alleged to have given birth to Musk’s child, has filed a legal petition for custody. According to a Daily Mail report, Musk appeared on-screen wearing a dark suit jacket in a Manhattan courtroom while his lawyers, Alyssa Rower and Jennifer Isaacman, were present in person. The hearing comes hours later the tech billionaire announced his exit from DOGE, making his courtroom appearance even more unexpected.St. Clair, 26, filed the lawsuit in February, claiming that Musk had asked her to keep the birth of their child a secret. She alleges that after initial talks about child support, Musk cut off contact, forcing her to seek legal action.Following Thursday’s two-and-a-half-hour hearing, St. Clair was seen smiling as she left the courtroom with her attorneys, Dror Bikel and Karen B. Rosenthal. She wore a modest navy-blue sweater with a pleated skirt and a beige coat. Her lawyers declined to comment when approached by reporters.The hearing was held in Part 44 of the New York Supreme Court before Judge Jeffrey Pearlman. Due to the sensitive nature of the case, the judge ordered the proceedings sealed — a move first granted on March 14 at the request of Musk’s legal team, limiting what St. Clair can publicly discuss about the case.As mentioned above, the court session came less than 24 hours after Musk announced he was quitting his advisory role in the Trump administration. Taking to social media platform X, Musk wrote “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”","Ashley St. Clair, a conservative influencer, alleged to have given birth to Musk’s child, has filed a legal petition for custody.

A fan project combining humor, talent, and nostalgia

""demakes,""





The fan-made endeavor is sweeping the internet with a lighthearted yet intriguing question: How would Grand Theft Auto 6 be if it was released in the PS2 era? YouTuber Foosmoke recreated the second official GTA 6 trailer using early 2000s low-resolution textures, animation, and charm of games such as San Andreas and Vice City. The outcome is an entertaining and absolutely imaginative tribute that has stoked fans online.In this demake, all scenes from GTA 6's Trailer 2 are painstakingly recreated with PS2-era assets and visual oddities. The game employs blocky character models, stiff movements, and flat shading to emulate the hallmark aesthetic of Rockstar's classics. Even vehicles and environments have been reduced to polygon-laden designs with clipping zones in plain sight, just the way fans remember games from the early 2000s.Made by YouTuber Foosmoke, the video is a complete shot-for-shot remake of the trailer, down to the music and pacing. It's not a parody, it's an homage, and the devotion to detail is what makes it stand out. From reduced-explosion greatness to vacated sidewalks, the demake highlights just how much gaming has come in terms of advancement while still pulling from a massive sense of nostalgia.The video, having gained hundreds of thousands of hits, has been praised for its humor and authenticity. One fan commented, ""This is beautiful...now all we need is some gameplay of this ps2 version.""Another,which indicates how much the project has been appreciated by the fans.This PS2-era recreation is more than a great-looking gimmick, it shows the creativity of the GTA fan base. It's also part of a larger phenomenon ofin which games or trailers are reimagined on current tech using the resources and constraints of older hardware.Foosmoke's project not only puts a smile on fans' faces, it's also honoring the legacy of Grand Theft Auto and reminding us how far the series has come, particularly in visuals, physics, and open-world detail.By making GTA 6 a PS2-era trailer, Foosmoke has caused laughter and applause. It's a playful mix of parody and tribute that will appeal to the franchise's long-time fans, demonstrating that even in a time of hyper-realism, there's always space for low-poly love.Also Read: GTA 6 screenshots recreated in Cyberpunk 2077 showcase Rockstar’s next-gen visual leap","YouTuber Foosmoke recreated the second official GTA 6 trailer using early 2000s low-resolution textures, animation, and charm of games such as San Andreas and Vice City.

No GTA 6 on Xbox store yet – Is PlayStation taking the lead?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/no-gta-6-on-xbox-store-yet-is-playstation-taking-the-lead/articleshow/121525532.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

PlayStation gets head-start as Xbox Store is empty

What it does to Xbox players and Rockstar's strategy





Rockstar Games announced that Grand Theft Auto 6 will come out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026. However, there is a visible disparity that is getting people speculating: GTA 6 is wishlistable on the PlayStation Store, but not the Xbox Store. This discrepancy has got people speculating that Sony might have got a marketing deal with Rockstar, providing PlayStation an early publicity lead.As it stands, only PlayStation customers are able to wishlist GTA 6 via their digital store. The fact that it is exclusive from Xbox's marketplace indicates that Sony could have a timed marketing deal with Rockstar Games. Such a deal doesn't influence the games release date or availability of content but does reserve Sony the right to exclusively market the title via its platform, brand, and possible early advertising rights.Backing this up, the second GTA 6 trailer was filmed entirely on a PlayStation 5, a deliberate action to present the game on Sony hardware and align it with the PlayStation brand. Xbox players may not be denied the game itself, but they are left to wait for listings and pre-order opportunities, which can affect fan attitude and momentum on that front.A lack of an Xbox Store listing does not mean a delay or exclusivity to PlayStation in gameplay.Rockstar has stated that GTA 6 will be released concurrently on both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The present state probably indicates Sony's marketing rights that will expire or dwindle as release date nears.Xbox players can look forward to the game showing up in their store in the next few months, most likely just in time for official pre-order dates. Meanwhile, Sony benefits from increased visibility, which may tip fence-sitting gamers toward its console.This pre-marketing lead showcases how promotional partnerships get to make an early impact on public opinion, particularly for a star like GTA 6.Though PlayStation seems to have the early promotional lead with GTA 6, Xbox gamers will not feel left out when the game drops. Rockstar's concurrent release strategy is not affected even as Sony leverages the present promotional highlight.Also Read: 7 micro missions we can expect to see in GTA 6","Rockstar Games announced that Grand Theft Auto 6 will come out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.

GTA 6 on PC vs console: What the ultimate experience might look like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/gta-6-on-pc-vs-console-what-the-ultimate-experience-might-look-like/articleshow/121525525.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

GTA 6’s console debut sets the tone for what’s to come

Why the PC version could become the ultimate way to play





The wait for GTA 6 has begun, and although console users are at the front of the line, PC gamers are already looking for the long haul. With Rockstar confirming console release in 2026 and a subsequent PC release later on, fans are arguing which platform will ultimately provide the most immersive experience. Will early access beat long-term flexibility or is the best version worth waiting for?When GTA 6 drops on May 26, 2026, it will be available only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. This is no shock, Rockstar has always tended to prioritize consoles for launch. The main benefit? Optimization. With built-to-spec hardware, Rockstar can optimize gameplay, graphics, and online performance to a high degree of consistency. Technologies such as HDR, ray tracing, and blindingly fast load times should shine on these platforms.Additionally, the online world should prove more stable when it launches. Staggering the PC release allows Rockstar to mitigate server load and fix initial bugs before a broader release. For those anxious to experience Vice City's neon-drenched mayhem immediately, console is the obvious choice, at least in the near future.Whereas PC gamers will have to wait, history indicates their patience will be rewarded. Rockstar's PC releases usually come out refined, with more extensive graphical settings and better performance, particularly on top-tier systems. Aside from that, the PC platform allows for custom radio stations, controller configuration, and, more critically, mods.The community of modders has already transformed GTA V into a superhero sandbox, a criminal empire simulator, and a hundred other things. GTA 6 on PC will very likely do the same, offering an infinitely customizable take on the game that grows far beyond its console incarnate.PC releases also receive community fixes, visual upgrade mods, and fan-made content that can keep the game going for years. Although it will not debut with the same bells and whistles, GTA 6 on PC could well prove to be the ultimate version.Console players will have GTA 6 first, with the benefit of Rockstar's refined release strategy. But for those patient, the PC build will offer a richer, more malleable experience fueled by fan creativity and tech advances. Whether immediacy or expertise is your priority, GTA 6 will not disappoint, the only question is when and where you play.Also Read: GTA 6 screenshots recreated in Cyberpunk 2077 showcase Rockstar’s next-gen visual leap","GTA 6 will be available only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

Whendropped in 2013, it didn’t just raise the bar, itthe bar. From dynamic gameplay to unforgettable characters, Rockstar delivered a near-perfect open-world experience. Now, as we count down to, one thing’s clear: some things fromabsolutely need to return. Here's a quick hit-list of what Rockstar nailed, and why we need more of it.Michael, Franklin, and Trevor - three wildly different personalities, three storylines, and one seamless mechanic to switch between them. This wasn't just a gimmick. It made the story richer, gave missions variety, and let players explore the world from different angles. Rockstar, please don’t leave this behind.Los Santos felt. Pedestrians had conversations, animals roamed the wild, and random events could trigger anywhere. It wasn’t more than just background, it was part of the game. Whether you were chasing a purse thief or stumbling into a cult, the world responded to you. This kind of immersive sandbox is what makes Rockstar games iconic, and it’s non-negotiable for GTA VI.Heists weren’t just about shooting your way through. You had to plan, choose your crew, pick your approach, and deal with the consequences. These multi-layered missions gave players creative freedom and replayability.Honestly, GTA V’s heists felt like mini-games inside the main game. That’s gold. Rockstar, bring them back, and make them bigger.Music in GTA has always been a vibe, but GTA V perfected it. From flying down the highway with Kendrick blasting to tuning in for hilarious talk shows, the soundtrack shaped the entire feel of the game. Rockstar knows how to mix iconic hits with hidden gems, and we need another banger playlist in GTA VI. Period.Tennis. Yoga. Golf. Stock market trading. Bounty hunting. GTA V blurred the lines between side quests and full-blown games. These weren’t throwaway extras, they were legit fun. It made the game feel endless, like there was always something to do. GTA VI shouldn’t just bring this back, it should level it up.Say what you want about GTA Online, but it’s a juggernaut. Heists, roleplaying servers, weekly events, business empires. Rockstar built an entire second life into the game. If GTA VI’s online mode learns from this and launches stronger from day one, it could be even more massive.GTA V wasn’t just successful because it was big. It wasbig, packed with details, features, and freedom that made players lose hours without even realizing it. If Rockstar carries forward these six wins into GTA VI, we're not just looking at a good sequel. We’re looking at a generational leap.","GTA V raised the bar with dynamic gameplay and unforgettable characters. Rockstar delivered a near-perfect open-world experience.

The hype aroundis. After two trailers, a confirmed 2026 release, and fan theories flooding every corner of the internet, Rockstar is officially sitting on the most anticipated game of the decade. But with sky-high expectations comes zero room for error. Here are threeRockstar simply can’t afford to make whenfinally hits shelves.Gamers are done giving free passes to buggy launches. Just ask CD Projekt Red () or Bethesda (). One game-breaking bug is all it takes for social media to turn the hype train into a meme fest.Rockstar's reputation has always leaned on polish and performance.andlaunched strong for the most part.needs to match, or better yet, exceed that bar. With over a decade of development time and delays, players expect a flawless experience on Day 1. No crashes, no rubberbanding NPCs, no disappearing cars. Just pure, immersive chaos, like it’s meant to be.Ifmade Rockstar billions, it also made players worried that story mode would take a backseat. And that’s the one thing fanswant.Lucia and Jason’s Bonnie-and-Clyde narrative has fans intrigued. But if Rockstar decides to cut corners and funnel most of its energy into the online grind, the backlash will be loud. Really loud.Players want a cinematic, choice-driven, emotionally punchy campaign, not a half-baked tutorial for Online. Rockstar needs to deliver an unforgettable story mode, or risk alienating a huge chunk of their core fanbase.Vice City isn’t just a setting. It’s a vibe. A whole mood. One drenched in neon, music, palm trees, and attitude. But nostalgia alone won’t carry. If Rockstar focuses too much on realism and forgets the signature satirical tone, wild side missions, and bizarre characters that made Vice City legendary, it’ll feel hollow.The world ofneeds personality. It needs chaos. It needs heart. A beautiful map is great. But what players really want is to feel something every time they boot up the game.isn’t just another game, it’s a cultural moment in the making. The trailers have set the tone, and now Rockstar has to. Messing up any of the above could tarnish not just a launch, but a legacy. Here’s hoping Rockstar knows what’s at stake and nails every last pixel.","With sky-high expectations comes zero room for error.
