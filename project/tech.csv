OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo sent to employees.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units. Despite Google's stock hitting all-time highs and rising over 120% since April, while Nvidia's shares dipped following the competitive news, Nvidia emphasised its leadership position, noting it remains 'a generation ahead of the industry.'","Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta.

GTA VI details from the leaked footage



GTA VI makers fires employees for leaking game data







GTA VI, Grand Theft Auto 6, in-development gameplay footage has reportedly been leaked online by a former Rockstar Games employee. The short demo reel suggests potential hints about new gameplay features and provides purported details regarding the game’s main characters ahead of its November 2026 launch. The franchise’s official trailer revealed in December 2023 broke global records, and the latest leaked footage has intensified the excitement surrounding the game.According to multiple reports online, including one from Game Rant, the leaked footage was included as part of an unnamed former employee’s demo reel. It primarily focused on showcasing new player animations, which includes bicycle rentals and truck bed riding.One clip shows a generic player character interacting with what appears to be a bike rental station, demonstrating smooth animations for both mounting and dismounting a bicycle. The second animation features one of the game's confirmed protagonists, Lucia Caminos, hopping off the roof of a truck and onto the ground.The demo reel also contained animation samples from other Rockstar titles, including Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA 5, and Max Payne 3, essentially pointing towards its authenticity as internal development material.Last month, Rockstar Games, the studio behind the GTA series, terminated over 30 employees for sharing confidential company information in public forums. The gaming giant said that the employees violated company policy by “distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.” A Rockstar spokesperson insisted the action “was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities. ”Meanwhile, the developers have pushed back the GTA VI launch date from May 2026 to November 2026. The game is set in Vice City, and will feature dual protagonists, Lucia and Jason Duval. It has been rumoured that the version of Vice City map in GTA VI will have significantly deeper environments with far more interior spaces for players to explore.","In-development gameplay footage has reportedly been leaked online by a former Rockstar Games employee.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

How to clear Gmail storage quickly and effectively

Empty the Trash and Spam folders

Delete large emails and attachments

Remove newsletters and old promotional emails

Use the Google One Storage Manager to clear space across all services

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to Trash and stay there for up to 30 days. They still count towards storage until the Trash is emptied. The same applies to the Spam folder. By opening each folder and selecting the option to permanently delete all items, users often free up space instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow.

"From hey Siri to hey Subbu? Apple hires Amar Subramanya, taking a bite out of Google via Microsoft",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-hey-siri-to-hey-subbu-apple-hires-amar-subramanya-taking-a-bite-out-of-google-via-microsoft/articleshow/125709125.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

In the predatory world of American artificial intelligence, where top engineers command salaries in the millions and signing bonuses rival small fortunes, Apple Inc has taken a big bite out of Microsoft and Google The iPhone giant on Monday announced the hiring of Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, as its new vice president of artificial intelligence, in an effort to catch up with rivals who have sped ahead. Subramanya steps into a role vacated by the retiring John Giannandrea, inheriting oversight of Apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and AI safety teams amid a high-stakes push to salvage its lagging AI ambitions.Subramanya's whirlwind journey—from Alphabet's Mountain View labs, where he helmed engineering for the Gemini AI assistant, to Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for a five-month co-piloting stint as corporate vice president of AI, and now to sickly Siri at Apple's Cupertino campus—epitomizes the escalating talent war gripping Silicon Valley and beyond.With Microsoft poaching over 20 researchers from Google's DeepMind unit earlier this year, including Subramanya in July, and now Apple counter-recruiting from its rivals, the US AI ecosystem has become a revolving door of elite minds, many of them immigrants like Subramanya.The migration isn't just about prestige; it's a battle for the intellectual capital needed to build the next generation of intelligent machines, as companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic lure defectors with million dollar windfalls, even as MAGA myopics mope about “slave labor” and “code coolies” from India and wallow in toxic gibes on X.At 46, Subramanya arrives with impeccable credentials tailored to Apple's pain points. After earning a BE in electrical, electronics, and communications engineering from Bangalore University in 2001, he completed his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle in 2009 with a dissertation on semi-supervised learning and graphical models, innovative techniques for training AI systems with limited labeled data — now a boon for privacy-obsessed Apple, which shuns vast user-data troves in favor of synthetic and licensed datasets.Subramanya's graduate work also extended to practical applications in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity analysis. As a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, he tackled multi-sensory fusion for robust speech systems and speaker verification, earning a prestigious Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship in 2007. This early exposure to Big Tech's labs foreshadowed his career, blending theory with deployment. His scholarly output includes the influential book Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning (co-authored with Partha Pratim Talukdar), a staple in machine learning curricula. His academic papers span entity resolution, multilingual Natural Language Processing, cross-document coreference, and audio-visual speech enhancement, underscoring his focus on scalable, multimodal systems.These foundations propelled Subramanya's 16-year Google tenure, starting around 2009 in research roles that evolved into engineering leadership. By 2023, he was head of engineering for Gemini, Google's multimodal powerhouse boasting up to 1.2 trillion parameters. Under his watch, teams of over 100 bridged experimental prototypes to production, integrating text, image, and video processing into Search, YouTube, and Android.Subramanya's pivot to Microsoft in July 2025 – along with a score of gearheads including engineering lead Sonal Gupta – was a cultural reset. In a LinkedIn post that raised plenty of eyebrows, he praised the software giant's ""refreshingly low-ego yet bursting with ambition"" ethos, throwing shade at Google's high-pressure environment. As corporate VP of AI, he contributed to foundation models powering Copilot, the enterprise chatbot embedded in Office and Azure.Both Microsoft and Google are led by Indian-Americans – Satya Nadella and Sundar Picha- – but Subramanya’s stint outside Seattle lasted less than six months before Tim Cook lured him back to Silicon Valley.For Apple, reeling from AI stumbles, Subramanya is a strategic antidote. The company's Apple Intelligence suite, unveiled in October 2024, has faltered: notification summaries spawned fabricated headlines, from false reports of a suspect's suicide to premature sports victories to Netanyahu’s arrest, drawing ire and lawsuits. Siri's promised overhaul—touted for contextual awareness and app control—languished after internal tests flopped, delaying rollout to spring 2026.Giannandrea, like Subramanya a Google import who once led Machine Intelligence, is said to have fostered research but struggled with product delivery. His 2024 paper on ""large-reasoning models"" critiqued AI's simulated cognition, yet Apple's outputs lagged. Now, with Giannandrea advising until spring, Subramanya will report to software SVP Craig Federighi, tasked with accelerating a 1-trillion-parameter in-house model while leaning on Apple’s upcoming $1 billion licensing deal with Gemini to revive Siri – delicious irony in the Apple-Google feud spanning maps to mobile.","Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, has been hired as Apple's new vice president of artificial intelligence.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

As a result, the Hero Mini Pekka in Clash Royale now stands as one of the most complete hero units available, providing value in nearly every situation and countering many of the most popular win conditions in the 2025 meta.At its core, the Hero Mini Pekka in Clash Royale shares the same familiar design as the original Mini Pekka but elevates its performance through its exclusive Hero Ability, Breakfast Boost. This ability sets it apart from regular troops, enabling the unit to gain temporary level-ups during battle. As Breakfast Boost charges naturally over time, activating it temporarily enhances the card’s stats with a massive +40% boost per hit to both damage and HP.These temporary level gains can stack up to +5 levels above the card’s base during a match, dramatically increasing its threat level while simultaneously restoring health after absorbing damage. This dual benefit - burst durability and rapid offensive scaling - makes the Hero Mini Pekka remarkably effective at dismantling high-HP win conditions such as Golem, Giant, and tank-based double-lane pushes. Its survivability lets it return to fights quickly, turning defensive holds into powerful counterattacks.Players have crafted several high-performance decks that capitalize on the Hero Mini Pekka’s damage scaling, defensive reliability, and counterpush strength. Among the strongest and most popular builds this season are:A staple in the current meta, this deck pairs the Hero Mini Pekka’s ability to punish tanks and support troops with the relentless pressure of the Royal Giant. When combined with spells like Rage and supporting troops such as Spirits, this setup enables quick, overwhelming sequences that shred defenses and rapidly break tower lines. The Hero’s ability to tank and heal makes counterpushes especially threatening, allowing this deck to thrive against beatdown and control archetypes.For players seeking an aggressive, cycle-oriented approach, this deck offers one of the best control strategies in the game. Hog Rider and Earthquake handle tower pressure and building counters, while the Hero Mini Pekka secures the defensive side by eliminating tanks and punishing overextensions. Its versatility gives players confidence in both cycling pressure and maintaining defensive stability, making this one of the most balanced Hero Mini Pekka deck options.This classic combination receives a powerful upgrade with the inclusion of the Hero Mini Pekka. In this deck, Giant serves as the primary tank while Graveyard applies unpredictable pressure that forces out defensive responses. The Hero Mini Pekka’s burst damage cuts through defending troops, enabling more effective Graveyard activations. With cards like Witch, Snowball, and Arrows rounding out swarm control, this deck excels at breaking through layered defenses and maintaining arena dominance.To unlock the full potential of the Hero Mini Pekka, players must understand the importance of timing and synergy. Deploying the unit during key defensive moments ensures that it absorbs damage efficiently before healing through its ability. Once stabilized, it transitions seamlessly into counterattacks, where its damage scaling becomes especially dangerous.Players are encouraged to pair the Hero Mini Pekka with support options such as Heal Spirit, Rage, or splash units to clear swarms and assist in momentum-building pushes. Adaptability also remains crucial, as many decks recommend flexible troop substitutions - including Firecracker, Dark Prince, or Witch - to better match individual playstyles or counter specific opponents. Proper timing of the Breakfast Boost ability can instantly change the outcome of a push, turning a defensive stand into a tower-breaking surge.While raw damage plays a major role in its appeal, the Hero Mini Pekka’s true strength lies in its overall flexibility. It provides unmatched balance between offense and defense, excels in multiple archetypes, and remains one of the few cards capable of both initiating fights and responding powerfully to enemy win conditions.Its in-battle healing and temporary level boosts give it enormous clutch potential, often allowing it to survive scenarios where traditional troops would fall. Whether aiming to climb trophies or take on high-stakes competitive challenges, players find that building a deck around the Hero Mini Pekka in Clash Royale opens the door to more dynamic strategies and greater opportunities to outplay opponents.Also read: Heroes in Clash Royale explained - How to unlock, Hero Slots guide, all available Heroes, best gameplay strategies, and more The Hero Mini Pekka in Clash Royale has cemented itself as one of the strongest hero cards in Clash Royale’s 2025 environment.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B





Tech billionaire Elon Musk has said there is a ""high probability"" that humanity is living inside a simulation, arguing that rapid advances in video games and AI now make the idea hard to ignore.In a recent interview with Nikhil Kamath, Musk explained his view by pointing to how games have moved from basic screens like Pong, “two rectangles and a square batting back and forth”, to today’s photo-realistic, real-time games played by millions.Musk said that if this trend continues, games will one day be impossible to distinguish from real life, with highly intelligent characters built into them. That, he argued, raises the possibility that our own reality could be a simulation.This is not the first time Musk has shared this belief. Years ago, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he made a similar argument.""If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilisation will end. One of those two things will occur,"" Musk said, adding, ""Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation, because we exist.""The idea he refers to is known as the “simulation hypothesis,” a long-running debate in philosophy and science. The concept suggests that a technologically advanced civilisation could create countless simulated worlds, and the people inside them would struggle to know what is real.","Elon Musk has said there is a ""high probability"" that humanity is living inside a simulation.

Qatar's Hayya Visa upgrade

Two months and multiple entries

Extended Stay: Residents of GCC nations (including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait) can now stay in Qatar for up to two months (60 days) on a single Hayya visa application. This extended duration provides ample time for visitors to explore cultural sites, natural attractions, and the packed calendar of year-round events.



Multiple-Entry Access: The new visa grants multiple-entry access. This means visitors can travel in and out of Qatar throughout the season without needing to reapply each time, greatly facilitating short, frequent trips for events or weekend getaways from neighboring countries.



What is the Hayya Platform?

Integrated Services: Hayya integrates visa processing with other essential travel elements, including event access, accommodation booking, transport planning, and general lifestyle services



Official Entry Document: Originally launched for the 2022 FIFA World Cup , the Hayya system successfully processed entry permits for millions of fans, and it continues to serve as the mandatory entry document for specified categories of visitors, including those utilizing the new GCC Resident Visa (A2).



Why did Qatar make the move?





From 30 November 2025, Qatar expanded the Hayya GCC Resident Visa (A2): eligible residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity. The update was announced by Qatar Tourism in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and the committee managing visitor entry as the country prepares for a busy winter of sports and cultural events.Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2), dramatically simplifying travel for expatriates living across the Gulf. These changes, which officially took effect on November 30, 2025, are specifically designed to support the expected surge in regional visitors and streamline entry during Qatar's busy season of international events.The updates, announced by Qatar Tourism in partnership with the Ministry of Interior, aim to reinforce the country’s position as a regional tourism hub. They mark a key moment for the Hayya platform, which serves as Qatar's official digital e-visa gateway, uniting visa processing with essential travel and lifestyle services into a single, comprehensive interface.The core of the Hayya update offers two major benefits that significantly improve flexibility and convenience for GCC residents:This updated system is engineered to ensure smoother entry through all ports of arrival, air, land, and sea, strengthening Qatar's operational readiness during peak visitor periods.The name ""Hayya"" (هَيّا) literally translates from Arabic to ""Let's Go!"" or ""Come On!"", perfectly reflecting its purpose as Qatar’s main facilitator for welcoming visitors.The platform is far more than just a visa application portal. It serves as Qatar's unified official digital e-visa gateway, designed to provide a seamless travel experience from the moment a visitor plans their trip:This comprehensive, digital-first approach embodies Qatar's vision to modernize its tourism sector and make entry into the country as efficient and appealing as possible.The timing of the Hayya upgrade is strategic, coinciding with a high-profile season of sports and cultural activities set to draw large crowds from the GCC region.The primary immediate driver is the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup. By simplifying access for regional fans, Qatar aims to maximize spectator numbers for this major tournament. The move also supports a vibrant line-up of surrounding cultural and entertainment events, encouraging attendees to extend their stays beyond the stadiums.Saeed Al Kuwari, Director of Hayya, emphasized that the new measures are more than just procedural tweaks. They reflect Qatar Tourism's ""broader vision to strengthen the country's openness to the region, facilitate visitor movement during major sports and cultural events, increase arrivals, and enhance tourism's contribution to the national economy.",Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2) Residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity.

The US has been an “immense beneficiary” of talent from India, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said, and voiced strong support for the H1B visa programme, cautioning that shutting it down would “actually be very bad” for America. The US tech billionaire made the remarks in an interview with investor and entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, released Sunday.“Yes, I think America has benefited immensely from talented Indians who have come to America... America has been an immense beneficiary of talent from India,” Musk said.On the H-1B visa , Musk aid, while there has been some misuse of the work visa programme, he strongly believes that it should not be shut down. “It would be accurate to say that... some of the outsourcing companies have gamed the system on the H-1B front. And we need to stop the gaming of the system. “But I’m certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B programme. That’s where some on the right are. I think they don’t realise that that would actually be very bad,” Musk said.His comments come at a time when the US has launched a massive crackdown to check abuse of the H-1B visa programme, used extensively by American technology firms to employ foreign workers.Indian professionals form one of the largest groups of H-1B visa holders.Responding to a question on whether the US “seems to have become anti-immigration”, Musk said there are different schools of thought on the issue. Musk pointed out that under the Joe Biden administration, “it was a total free-for-all, with like no border controls, which, you know, unless you’ve got border controls, you’re not a country”. Musk alleged there was “massive” illegal immigration under Biden, which created a negative selection effect.","US tech billionaire made the remarks in an interview with investor and entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath.

Why MeatCanyon was banned and unbanned on Twitch in November 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/why-meatcanyon-was-banned-and-unbanned-on-twitch-in-november-2025/articleshow/125703149.cms,"Image Via ""X""

What we know about MeatCanyon’s brief ban and quick return





Twitch viewers were left puzzled at the end of November 2025 when popular creator MeatCanyon suddenly disappeared from the platform following a brief and unexplained suspension. Fans noticed the ban late on November 29, with tracking sites confirming enforcement action against his channel. Given MeatCanyon's history of pushing boundaries through dark humor and provocative animation, speculation quickly spread about what may have triggered his sixth ban. But with no official reason provided, the incident became another example of Twitch’s opaque moderation system and how creators often learn about their suspensions at the same time as their audiences.The conversation intensified as the timeline became clearer. Enforcement logs showed the ban lasted for just over one day, and social media updates soon confirmed that MeatCanyon had been unbanned and regained access to his channel. This rapid turnaround led to even more discussion about whether the suspension was due to a specific piece of content or simply routine enforcement. Meanwhile, clips circulating on social platforms pointed to a recent joke made on CreepCast that referenced Hasan and his dog, though even fans acknowledged that this connection was speculative and not confirmed by Twitch.According to publicly available tracking data, MeatCanyon’s channel received a suspension around November 29–30, marking his sixth recorded ban on the platform. These logs later updated to show the ban as resolved, aligning with his social posts stating the suspension had been lifted. However, Twitch, consistent with its standard practice, did not reveal what specific guideline was violated. This lack of clarity has fueled ongoing debate within the community about enforcement consistency, especially when bans are issued and reversed in such a short window.Because Twitch has not provided details, the link to the CreepCast joke remains unverified, and creators have cautioned against assuming causation. What’s clear is that enforcement actions are often swift and temporary, leaving both streamers and viewers without concrete answers. The quick unban suggests the violation, if any, was minor or reconsidered internally.MeatCanyon’s short-lived suspension highlights Twitch’s ongoing challenges with transparency around enforcement. While fans continue to speculate on the possible cause, the streamer is fully reinstated and back to producing content. Until Twitch adopts clearer communication practices, moments like these will continue sparking conversation, and confusion, across the streaming community.Also Read: Twitch streamer MeltIsLIVE survives terrifying high-speed crash caught on livestream",Twitch streamer MeatCanyon was banned for just over a day on November 29.

“Why are people so quick to want to hurt and try to take down others? Come on.

Popular VTuber Zentreya's recent introduction of the “General Zentreya” model was met with a series of backlash and hatred on social media. Within hours of its reveal on November 27, 2025, the internet turned it into a controversy that she never intended in the first place. While some fans praised the updated aesthetic, haters were quick to point out the model’s military-inspired outfit of echoing extremist behaviour and intentions.The widespread criticism spread quickly when X user @daitan_kodi claimed that the design carried a “N*zi vibe,” owing to its colour palette and certain stylistic choices. The discourse turned toxic, which forced Zentreya to defend both her intentions and her community.

Zheng said the situation “smells like trying to take someone else down because it makes them feel better, makes them feel bigger.”He further called the controversy infuriating and felt that it was born more from needless nitpicking to create drama rather than sincere concerns.

Avoid using your mobile phone while driving. Follow parking rules and avoid blocking fire hydrants or reserved spaces. Be extra cautious near school zones and bus stops. Regularly check your black points through apps, SMS notifications, or official websites.





Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125635285,imgsize-1346699,width-400,resizemode-4/uae.jpg"

“Tommy just lost 50% of his supporters with this one move!”

“Nick Fuentes defends extremism abroad while aiming at the wrong targets at home.”

“People are saying the timing of his Israel trip explains everything — and it’s no coincidence.”

“Fuentes is a Qatari-backed spy-op sent to split the movement — wake up!”

“Shouldn’t you be focusing on England instead of picking fights online?”

“He’s part of the very system he claims to fight against.”

“Fuentes has answered the January 6 question countless times — stop trying to paint him as a fed.”

“America has no idea how Islamic communities operate — Tommy needs to get on US podcasts and explain it.”

“Fuentes has no clue what it’s like living near Islamic neighbourhoods — he’s speaking from a bubble.”

“Your constant alignment with Israel is hurting your own cause — this isn’t helping you.”





A new online dispute has broken out between Tommy Robinson and American commentator Nick Fuentes, after Fuentes referred to Robinson as a “Zionist tool” in a circulating clip. The video, shared widely across X, shows Fuentes accusing Robinson of being used to provoke clashes in Britain and to undermine pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

Cat Goetze, a tech founder known online as ""CatGPT,"" has turned a personal quest for nostalgia into a six-figure business, banking on a generation’s desire to disconnect. According to a report by CNBC Make It, Goetze’s startup, Physical Phones, generated $120,000 in sales in its first three days after going viral on social media in July 2025. By the end of October, the business had sold over 3,000 units, totaling $280,000 in revenue. The product—a retro-styled handset that looks like a traditional landline but connects to smartphones via Bluetooth—was born out of Goetze’s desire to reduce her own screen time without sacrificing connectivity.Two years ago, Goetze sought to replace her smartphone usage with something ""low-tech."" However, she discovered that installing a true landline in her apartment was both expensive and logistically difficult.""I was kind of just sitting around [thinking] it’d be so cute if we still had landline phones and you could twirl the cord and talk with your friends,"" Goetze told CNBC Make It. ""That just felt nostalgic and chic to me.""Taking matters into her own hands, Goetze ""hijacked"" a thrifted landline phone and engineered it to be Bluetooth compatible. For two years, the pink clamshell device served as her primary communication hub at home, allowing her to take calls and even buzz guests into her building.When she finally unveiled the device to her social media audience in July 2025, she anticipated a modest response, setting up a shop hoping for 15 to 20 pre-orders she could build manually. Instead, the demand was instantaneous.""It literally felt like we had captured lightning in a bottle,"" she told the CNBC.Physical Phones are currently available in five styles ranging from $90 to $110. While Goetze originally built them by hand, she has since partnered with an electronics manufacturer, with the first major batches shipping this December.The devices function as an extension of a user’s smartphone:Pairs with iPhone and Android via Bluetooth.The device rings for standard calls as well as audio/video calls from apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, Instagram, and Snapchat.Users can dial numbers directly or use the star key (*) to activate voice assistants (like Siri or Google Assistant) to dial contacts by name.R u reading this caption because the video started to get boring?Ur gonna check the comments next huh?It’s ok.That’s your brain looking for more rustling leaves in the Savannah.If that doesn’t make sense, you just haven’t gotten far enough in the video yet.Force 1= tech companies. They get paid more $ the longer you stay here, so they wanna hook u. Bad.Force 2= about two thousand centuries of evolution. Your brain is hardwired to reward noticing novel, unexpected things. Your feed is a FLOOD of novel, unexpected things. The rewards feel so good, it almost feels like a trance-like state.Dont feel bad. We all have monkey brains. How do u think we got here?!!!But u can protect ur monkey brain. In the next video I’ll explain 3 tricks I used to get off of social media for 5 years.I’m committed to bringing down my screen time this year but I know I need to be reachable in case of emergency. Also, living out my nostalgic 90s dream is very important to me.YES it takes FaceTime Audio and WhatsApp calls.YES it works with AndroidNO, you will not know who’s calling. Like the olden days.YES they are the coolest cutest things ever.","Cat Goetze, a tech founder known online as ""CatGPT,"" has turned a personal quest for nostalgia into a six-figure business.

The rankings are determined through blind comparisons where users vote for their preferred output without knowing which company generated the video.The results place Google's Veo 3 model in second place, and OpenAI’s Sora 2 Pro model significantly lower in seventh place.Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela framed the achievement as a David-versus-Goliath victory.“We managed to out-compete trillion-dollar companies with a team of 100 people.""You can get to frontiers just by being extremely focused and diligent,"" Valenzuela told CNBC, noting that Gen 4.5 was codenamed ""David"" internally.“It does feel like a very interesting moment in time where the era of efficiency and research is upon us,” Valenzuela said on the shifting landscape.
