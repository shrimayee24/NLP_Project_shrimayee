Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

The release of Meghan’s book could further inflame tensions between the Sussexes and the Royal Family , particularly following the mixed reception of Harry's memoir, Spare.Bower also criticized Meghan’s acting career, remarking, “The problem is, she isn’t a great actress. Her acting career ended long before she arrived in London - that’s why she came here. She couldn’t find any more work after Suits.”Speculation about Meghan’s autobiography has been circulating since Harry’s book gained attention in early 2023. Some publishing experts believe it is strategic for the couple to delay further releases, as maintaining public interest is crucial. An insider noted, “Fans are fickle. Disappoint them once, and a book can freefall into irrelevance super quickly, even with the momentum of something like Spare behind it. Their team, who are good at what they do, wants to make the angry mobs salivate for it before throwing Meghan’s story to the masses because even the bad press is good press for this couple.”","Royal expert Tom Bower has highlighted the lucrative possibilities of such a book, predicting it could significantly boost their income.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app’s impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd’s editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app’s design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk’s social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a “dating supermarket,” these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How to ‘quit’ Google Chrome’s Kiosk mode

Researchers have spotted a new way that hackers are using to steal passwords of users of Google Chrome . They install malware that locks the screen, essentially preventing users from accessing any other app on the system.According to a team of researchers at OALABS – a malware analysis services company – stealers are now using a new type of Google Chrome malware that first locks users out of their system, preventing them from accessing any other apps and then forcing them to type in login credentials like usernames and passwords and then steal them.The malware, dubbed ‘ StealC ’, uses a new technique called “AutoIt Credential Flusher” that forces victims to enter their Google account details to access the system. The researchers say that this technique has been in use since last month.The researchers claim that StealC uses Chrome’s Kiosk Mode feature, a functionality designed to restrict user access on public computers by locking them into a fullscreen Chrome window and disabling standard exit keys like F11 and Esc.Used at public places, Kiosk Mode has its elements like toolbars, navigation buttons and the address bar removed from Chrome's interface so that there is no interaction with people. The malware leverages this mode to present users with a seemingly unavoidable page that prompts them to enter their Google account credentials to regain control of their system.Once the unsuspecting individual types in their username and password, this sensitive information is immediately captured and stolen by the StealC malware, an info-stealing program first identified in February of the previous year.If you are affected by this, and are stuck in Chrome’s Kiosk mode, use keyboard shortcuts like “Alt+F4”, “Ctrl + Shift + Esc”, “Ctrl + Alt + Delete” and “Alt+Tab” to exit the mode, or go to Windows Task Manager to quit the app.If you are unable to do it, restart the PC, scan it for any virus or malware and remove them.","Researchers have spotted a new way that hackers are using to steal passwords of users of Google Chrome.

Explained: What is Pharming online scam and tips to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-pharming-online-scam-and-tips-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113547631.cms,"How does pharming work?

Compromised DNS Servers : Hackers often target Domain Name System (DNS) servers, which translate website addresses (URLs) into numerical IP addresses. By compromising these servers, attackers can manipulate the DNS records, directing users to malicious websites instead of the intended destination.

Malicious Code Injection: Attackers may also inject malicious code into legitimate websites, either through vulnerabilities in the website's content management system or by exploiting security flaws in the web server. This code can then redirect users to phishing or malware-infected sites.



Tips to stay safe from pharming:

Verify Website URLs: Always double-check the URL of the website you are visiting. Look for any unusual characters or spelling errors.

Use Reputable Browsers and Antivirus Software: Keep your web browser and antivirus software up-to-date with the latest security patches. Reputable browsers often have built-in security features to protect against phishing attacks.

Be Cautious of Phishing Emails: Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. Never click on links in emails from unknown senders.

Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help protect your privacy and security online by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your IP address.

Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks: Public Wi-Fi networks are often less secure than private networks. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping.



Pharming is a type of online scam where malicious code is secretly installed on a legitimate website or network server, redirecting unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites. This redirection often occurs without the user's knowledge or consent.Farming does not require you to click on an initial link. It works by putting malicious code into your computer or at an internet server Lebel which automatically redirects you to a fake alternate side when you try to access a legitimate one.This site would be designed to impersonate the genuine site and is aimed to trick you into sharing your credentials.By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to a pharming scam and protect your personal information online.","Pharming is a type of online scam where malicious code is secretly installed on a legitimate website or network server, redirecting unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites.

EU warns Apple to open up iOS to rivals or face fines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-warns-apple-to-open-up-ios-to-rivals-or-face-fines/articleshow/113528056.cms,"The European Union has issued a warning to Apple, demanding the tech giant open its iPhone and iPad operating systems to rival technologies or risk significant fines under new antitrust rules . The EU 's competition watchdog announced that Apple must comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) within six months or face potential penalties.EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager announced that the commission is using specification proceedings for the first time under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance.The move aims to compel Apple to re-engineer its services, allowing rival companies access to the iOS and iPadOS ecosystems.The proceedings target two main areas: iOS connectivity features for devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets, and Apple's process for addressing developers' requests for third-party interoperability with iOS and iPadOS.The commission aims to specify how Apple should provide effective interoperability, allowing non-Apple devices to easily pair and connect with iPhones and receive notifications. This move is designed to ensure fair and open digital markets, with a focus on smartphone operating systems playing a crucial role.Apple responded by saying it has created ways for developers to request additional interoperability while protecting user security. The company warned that undermining built-in protections could put European consumers at risk.""Undermining the protections we've built over time would put European consumers at risk, giving bad actors more ways to access their devices and data,"" Apple said in the statement to Reuters.This action follows a preliminary finding in June that Apple had breached DMA rules by not allowing App Store developers to freely inform users about alternative payment options outside its ecosystem.Apple has already made several changes to comply with the DMA, including opening up iOS and iPadOS to third-party app stores and allowing developers access to its NFC technology.If Apple fails to comply, the EU may launch a formal probe that could lead to fines of up to 10% of the company's global annual sales. This action comes alongside an existing investigation into Apple's App Store rules for developers.","The European Union has issued a warning to Apple, demanding the tech giant open its iPhone and iPad operating systems to rival technologies.

CHENNAI: Moments after completing a stroke-filled century against Bangladesh on the third day of the first Test here, the flamboyant Shubman Gill , in his trademark fashion, bowed to the crowd in celebration. While Gill was accorded a standing ovation, even by the players and coaches, he fully deserved an imitation of his celebratory act from the fans, who got their money's worth.The No.3 batter moved his feet like a nimble-footed ballet dancer, especially against spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Shakib Al Hasan , both of whom were treated with disdain.During the course of his unbeaten 119, Gill landed many punches on Miraz, launching the offspinner for four sixes over deep midwicket. His well-compiled knock was a fruit of the work he put in ahead of the twomatch Bangladesh assignment.""Scoring runs against any opposition gives you a lot of confidence. Playing against spin is what I have been working on. It (the innings) gives me a lot of satisfaction,"" said Gill, who scored 80 of his 119 against the visiting slow bowlers.""I trained before this series and had some plans. I think that I executed them well. It is not only about having a good defence; I must also not miss out on the opportunities that I get as a batter to score runs,"" added the 25-year-old. Gill proved to be a constant menace for the opposition attack, regularly dancing down the wicket and using his feet against the spinners.""It is something that I trained at when I was young. I have always been a tall guy, so it is easier for me to use my feet and play along the ground. Playing the ball in the air and hitting sixes came later, when I got more power (strength) in my body. It is hard for bowlers to settle on a pitch like this, where the odd one is turning but not all balls are turning.""Gill was extra keen to make it count after falling for a duck in the first essay: ""It (the duck) further motivated me to spend more time in the middle.""",Shubman Gill scores unbeaten 119 as India beat Bangladesh in first Test.
