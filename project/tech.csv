JABALPUR: Time and tide wait for none. Sometimes, not even a smartwatch. This is the lesson a passenger at Jabalpur station learned the hard way last week when his online samosa payment stalled and his train began chugging out.The passenger handed over his watch when a vendor allegedly grabbed his collar, threatening him and demanding payment for the snack and some other food items worth around Rs 180.The customer had got off a passing train briefly at Jabalpur to buy food on Oct 17. A viral video shows the vendor turning violent even as others look on. Realising he would miss his train, the passenger is seen quickly removing his smartwatch and handing it to the vendor before scampering to board his moving train. After the clip floated around, the vendor was booked under Section 145 of Railways Act, which pertains to “disorderly conduct and causing nuisance”. Police said he had been warned against repeating such misbehaviour.The episode unfolded on Platform no. 5. The passenger attempted to make the digital payment by scanning a QR code but the transaction failed. As the train began to move, he tried leaving, triggering the fracas with the vendor attached to Kanchan Restaurant on the platform.After the clip surfaced on social media, RPF took suo motu cognisance of a complaint posted on Twitter and summoned the vendor for questioning on Oct 18.","The customer had got off a passing train briefly at Jabalpur to buy food on Oct 17.

Bihar polls: Will ‘star’ power favour the political fortunes of parties?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-will-star-power-favour-the-political-fortunes-of-parties/articleshow/124703355.cms,"(From left) Pawan Singh, Maithili Thakur and Khesari Lal Yadav

Shah Avoids Naming Bihar CM Face, Says Bihar CM to Be Decided by Elected MLAs

Maithili Thakur: The Mithila pride card



Khesari Lal Yadav: RJD’s bid for the masses



The BJP-Pawan Singh reunion



The caste arithmetic



NEW DELHI: Bihar’s election stage has always had drama, but this time, the script has a cinematic twist. Folk singer Maithili Thakur , and Bhojpuri actors Khesari Lal Yadav and Pawan Singh , have all entered the political frame, turning the 2025 assembly battle into a fusion of star power and caste calculation.The BJP has fielded Maithili Thakur from Alinagar in Darbhanga, while the RJD has handed its Chapra ticket to Khesari Lal Yadav. Adding to the intrigue, Pawan Singh, who was once at odds with the BJP, has rejoined the party after months of speculation.Together, the three represent how Bihar’s two biggest parties are turning to popular faces from music and cinema to stir old loyalties and reshape caste equations.Alinagar sits in the heart of the Mithila region, where identity and language carry deep cultural pride. The BJP’s choice of Maithili Thakur is not just a nod to local sentiment but also a tactical move to expand appeal in a seat that has been closely fought.The constituency has shifted hands several times in recent years, and margins have been narrow. Maithili, a household name in the region, brings a blend of youth connect and cultural symbolism that the BJP hopes can widen its support base beyond traditional voters.Her campaign songs and folk roots are expected to draw attention across caste lines, especially among women and young voters who form a decisive chunk of the electorate.If the BJP is playing the Mithila card, the RJD has chosen to bank on Bhojpuri stardom. Khesari Lal Yadav’s candidature from Chapra in Saran district is designed to add glamour to a contest that has long been decided by caste arithmetic.Chapra has traditionally been a battleground between Yadavs and Rajputs, and the RJD’s decision to field Khesari is an attempt to consolidate the Yadav vote while energising youth and migrant workers who idolise him. The BJP won Chapra in 2020, but with thin margins. Khesari’s popularity among lower and backward castes gives the RJD a chance to turn that equation on its head.The party hopes that his folk appeal, built through music that often celebrates aspiration and struggle, will connect emotionally with voters who see politics through the lens of identity and pride rather than policy.The BJP’s patch-up with Pawan Singh was as political as it was pragmatic. A Rajput by caste and a massive name in the Bhojpuri entertainment industry, Singh had previously rebelled and flirted with contesting independently. His differences with the BJP had threatened to split the Rajput vote, especially in the Shahabad and Bhojpur regions where caste balance is delicate.His return to the party fold is a calculated move to heal that rift. BJP leaders believe Singh’s presence will help consolidate upper-caste support and attract younger, entertainment-driven voters who identify with his larger-than-life persona. The party has suffered from factionalism in parts of Shahabad, and Singh’s popularity in districts like Arrah, Buxar, and Karakat could help the BJP offset anti-incumbency and regain lost ground.According to Census data and voter surveys, the caste profile of these regions explains why the BJP and RJD chose their celebrity candidates so carefully. In Darbhanga’s Alinagar, upper castes, especially Maithil Brahmins and Rajputs, together account for about 25 to 30 per cent of the electorate, while Yadavs, Muslims, and EBC groups form the rest.Maithili Thakur’s candidature appeals directly to the Maithil Brahmin identity and to cultural pride cutting across caste lines. In Saran’s Chapra, Yadavs make up roughly 20 to 22 per cent, Rajputs and Bhumihars about 15 to 18 per cent, and EBCs and Muslims the remainder.That arithmetic explains why the RJD placed its faith in Khesari Lal Yadav to deepen Yadav consolidation while reaching EBC and lower-caste Bhojpuri voters who relate to him.Further west, in the Shahabad and Bhojpur belt, where Pawan Singh holds sway, Rajputs and Bhumihars together exceed 25 per cent, making them a crucial bloc for the BJP to retain. His re-entry aims to keep that segment united and offset the erosion seen in parts of Arrah and Karakat during 2024.While celebrity names attract attention, they do not always convert into victories. Bihar’s elections are fought at the booth level, where caste networks, local loyalty, and the ground machinery of parties still decide outcomes.Maithili’s appeal may help the BJP in Mithila, but it will need organisational muscle to translate her popularity into votes. Khesari’s fame gives the RJD visibility, but turning fans into voters requires the kind of micro-level mobilisation that only a well-oiled party machine can provide.Pawan Singh’s Rajput credentials may strengthen the BJP’s caste equation, but overreliance on charisma can backfire if local candidates fail to deliver on expectations.The entry of Maithili Thakur, Khesari Lal Yadav, and Pawan Singh has turned Bihar’s election into a curious blend of celebrity, caste, and calculation. The BJP and RJD are both using star power to energise their bases, yet beneath the glamour, it remains a story about numbers, of seats, votes, and social groups.","The BJP has fielded Maithili Thakur from Alinagar in Darbhanga.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch.He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace.

Michael Phelps reveals the surprising parenting trick helping his kids manage big emotions without chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/michael-phelps-reveals-the-surprising-parenting-trick-helping-his-kids-manage-big-emotions-without-chaos/articleshow/124712672.cms,"Michael Phelps (Image via Getty)

How Michael Phelps and his wife Nicole Johnson tackle big emotions in a busy household

The dramatic impact of small daily rituals on children’s emotional intelligence

Why talking about mental health from a young age is a game-changer in parenting

Parenting young children comes with its fair share of high-energy moments and emotional rollercoasters. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, has opened up about the ways he and his wife are helping their children handle intense feelings at home. Rather than letting emotions build up, the Phelps family has introduced simple yet effective techniques to encourage emotional expression and communication, creating a calmer, more understanding environment.With three young boys in the house, emotions often run high, leading to shouting matches, minor scuffles, and flying objects. ""Our boys, obviously, there are a lot of big emotions in the house. A lot of screaming, sometimes punches thrown, kicking, shoving, things, and objects that are thrown,"" Michael shared. To help the kids navigate these intense moments, the couple introduced a playful breathing exercise called the ‘lion breath. ’ The practice encourages children to take a deep breath, roar loudly, and then pause to reflect on the situation before reacting, giving them the space to process their emotions constructively.The results have been striking. ""At that point, they are able to take a step back and be like, 'Oh, Beckett did this, Boomer did this, Maverick did this,' and they can talk it through instead of compartmentalising it, letting it pile to the point that they explode,"" Phelps explained.The technique not only allows the children to express themselves without bottling up frustration but also helps them develop empathy by recognizing their siblings’ perspectives. This simple daily ritual is already making a lasting impact on the boys’ emotional well-being and communication skills.For Michael Phelps, teaching children to manage emotions is as important as any physical training. By making mental health a normal part of daily life, parents can foster a safe space for kids to express feelings without judgment or fear. Small steps like the lion breath can prevent outbursts and help children develop resilience, setting them up for healthier emotional habits in the long term. Phelps’ approach shows that even in a household full of energy and chaos, thoughtful parenting tools can make all the difference.Also read: Florida’s coaching search takes an intriguing turn as a surprising high-profile name quietly enters the mix","Olympian Michael Phelps and his wife Nicole Johnson have three young boys.

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has ramped up his investigation into Roblox, the hugely popular online gaming platform, issuing a criminal subpoena after evidence surfaced that sexual predators are exploiting the game to target minors.“Multiple investigations have revealed that sexual predators are using Roblox to access, communicate with, and groom minors,” Uthmeier said in a video posted on X. “Roblox profited off of our kids while exposing them to the most dangerous of harms. They enabled our kids to be abused. Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids.”The attorney general said predators have used the in-game currency, Robux, to bribe children into sending sexually explicit images. He added that victims accuse Roblox of failing to enforce adequate safety measures and of not warning parents of the risks.“These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on Roblox’ platform as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused,” Uthmeier said.Roblox responded that it shares the goal of keeping children safe and will continue to cooperate with the investigation, according to Florida Phoenix.“We have a strong record of working with law enforcement and investing in advanced safety systems to help protect our users and remove bad actors. To safeguard users, we prohibit the sharing of images and videos in the chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information, and we are working to implement age estimation for all users accessing chat features,” the company said.Uthmeier appeared on Fox & Friends First to explain the investigation, noting that Florida authorities have arrested over 1,000 child predators this year alone, many linked to Roblox. He described predators posing as children, engaging in long-term conversations, and in some cases, committing physical abuse.Roblox has previously appeared on the National Center on Sexual Exploitation’s Dirty Dozen list for 2023 and 2024, which highlights entities accused of enabling or profiting from sexual abuse.",Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has issued a criminal subpoena to Roblox.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Louvre Museum heist: Viral video shows suspect cutting glass to steal crown jewels — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/louvre-museum-heist-viral-video-shows-suspect-cutting-glass-to-steal-crown-jewels-watch/articleshow/124700066.cms,"How the thieves struck



On Cam: First Visuals Of Priceless Napoleon Jewels Robbed In Brazen Daylight Louvre Heist I Paris

What was stolen



Video sparks questions and investigation







The Louvre Museum, the world’s most-visited cultural landmark, was abruptly closed on Sunday following a daring daylight heist in the Apollon gallery, home to France’s crown jewels. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media, showing a suspect allegedly cutting through a glass display case with a mini chainsaw.According to French authorities, four balaclava-clad thieves arrived outside the museum along the Seine around 9:30 am, roughly half an hour after visitors began entering. The suspects used a truck with a basket lift and an extendable ladder to reach a second-floor balcony window. They then employed angle grinders and other power tools to smash glass displays and grab the priceless Napoleonic jewels.The robbery lasted less than 10 minutes, interior minister Laurent Nunez said, describing the culprits as “an experienced team who had clearly scouted the location.” As alarms sounded, the thieves fled on motorbikes, leaving behind some items, including Empress Eugenie’s crown and the Regent diamond, valued at more than US$60 million (£45m).The stolen items include a tiara, earrings, and a sapphire necklace from the jewellery sets of Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense, as well as pieces from the Marie-Louise set. These historic pieces were housed in the Apollon gallery, a hall built by Louis XIV in 1661, which later inspired the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.Police are now analysing the viral video obtained by BFMTV, which appears to show one of the suspects trying to access a jewellery case. Authorities are probing how the thieves bypassed museum security, and who could be the potential buyers of such priceless, historic items.","Four balaclava-clad thieves arrived outside the museum around 9:30 am, roughly half an hour after visitors began entering.

Kuwait's new rule: Mosques cannot install surveillance cameras without Ministry permission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwaits-new-rule-mosques-cannot-install-surveillance-cameras-without-ministry-permission/articleshow/124699894.cms,"Kuwait’s Awqaf Ministry issues strict new guidelines for mosque surveillance – monitoring, oversight and accountability now firmly in state hands / AI generated image for Illustration purposes only

What’s happening? Mosque surveillance rules in Kuwait

Any individual or organisation wishing to install or operate security cameras inside a mosque must first receive authorisation from the ministry.

Donations of cameras must be reported before installation: if someone offers a donation of surveillance equipment, the mosque’s imam or muezzin must notify the ministry before proceeding.

Any existing camera systems that were installed without ministry approval must be disclosed immediately.

The imams and muezzins will be held legally accountable if they fail to notify the ministry of unapproved systems.

The ministry states this is part of a broader effort to standardise mosque operations, protect mosque facilities and ensure the safety of worshippers.

Why the change?

Protection and safety of worshippers & facilities: The ministry explicitly says the aim is to safeguard the mosque premises, maintain safety, and ensure transparency.

Administrative control & oversight: By centralising supervision of camera systems, the ministry can ensure that installations comply with law and policy, rather than having ad-hoc or external parties setting up systems independently.

Standardising practices across mosques: The directive emphasises the goal of standardisation of mosque operations and functioning under governmental supervision.

Legitimacy of donations and external offers: Since mosques sometimes receive donated surveillance equipment (as happened in the past) the ministry appears to want to regulate that process tightly. For example, older reports show a corporate donation of 3,000 cameras to mosques in Kuwait from 2017.

Impacts and practical implications





On October 19, 2025, Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs issued a nationwide directive mandating that all surveillance cameras within mosques must receive prior approval from the ministry. This move places imams and muezzins under legal obligation to comply, marking a significant shift in the oversight of religious institutions across the country.Kuwait's Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has announced a new policy requiring all surveillance cameras in mosques to be approved by the ministry before installation. This directive, issued on October 19, 2025, mandates that imams and muezzins report any existing unapproved camera systems and prohibits unauthorized installations. The policy aims to standardize mosque operations, ensure transparency, and safeguard the facilities and worshippers.Key points:In short: New oversight means all surveillance inside mosques now must go through official channels.The ministry's decision comes in response to concerns over unauthorized surveillance installations and the need for centralized oversight. By requiring prior approval, the ministry seeks to maintain control over security measures in religious spaces, ensuring they align with national regulations and standards.This move also addresses potential privacy issues and aims to prevent misuse of surveillance systems.Several motivations appear behind this tightening of rules:Thus, the change reflects a move to ensure that mosque-surveillance is neither fragmented nor uncontrolled.The new rules have clear implications for mosques, imams, worshippers, and donors. Under the directive, no mosque can unilaterally accept or install surveillance cameras from external parties, including companies or donors, without prior ministry approval. Transparency is now mandatory: any offer of surveillance equipment must be reported before installation, and existing systems installed without authorization must be declared. Imams and muezzins carry legal responsibility for failing to comply, elevating the policy from mere guidance to enforceable law. All systems will fall under the ministry’s administrative oversight, which will likely regulate how cameras are installed, managed, and monitored. For donors, this means that contributions of surveillance equipment will require navigation through the approval process, replacing the previous practice of direct donations or installations. Overall, the directive establishes the ministry as the central gatekeeper for all mosque surveillance.For mosques across Kuwait, this policy means that any new surveillance installations must go through the ministry's approval process. Imams and muezzins are now legally responsible for reporting any unapproved systems and ensuring compliance with the new regulations. Donors wishing to contribute surveillance equipment must also notify the ministry before installation. This centralized approach aims to streamline security measures and maintain uniformity across religious institutions.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs issued a nationwide directive mandating that all surveillance cameras within mosques must receive prior approval from the ministry.

Behind the streams: Dr Disrespect’s wife, daughter, and family life

Balancing a streaming career and married life while maintaining family harmony





The streamer Dr Disrespect (Herschel “Guy” Beahm IV) is known for his bombastic on-screen persona, but behind the character lies a husband and father navigating life in the public eye. With a substantial streaming career, various controversies and a devoted family, he must balance the demands of his online persona with his responsibilities at home. This article looks at how he and his wife and family manage that balancing act.Dr Disrespect has been married to his wife, known online as Mrs Assassin, since around 2013. They share a daughter, affectionately referred to as Baby Disrespect or Baby Assassin, who occasionally appears in streams or is referenced. His wife maintains a very low-profile presence: she’s of mixed ethnicity with Filipino roots and resides in California.In late 2017, Dr Disrespect publicly admitted on stream to having been unfaithful to his wife and announced a break from streaming to focus on his family. During his ban from his main streaming platform, his wife remained a supportive figure behind the scenes. Although she rarely appears on camera, she’s known to support his brand, handle aspects of home life, and assist in integrating family moments into his online presence.Their ability to stay married through public scandal, shifting platforms and an evolving streaming career suggests a conscious effort to prioritise private life alongside public performance.On one hand, Dr Disrespect’s streaming persona demands spectacle: regular high-energy broadcasts, branded events, industry appearances and controversies that fuel viewership. On the other hand, maintaining a stable marriage and father-daughter relationship calls for support, privacy and personal sacrifices. His wife’s low profile plays a key role here: by choosing not to become a public figure herself, she affords the family some degree of normalcy beyond the stream. The fact that she steps in, supports his brand off-camera and helps manage home life allows him to focus part of his attention on the business side. Additionally, by occasionally featuring his daughter on stream and acknowledging his real-life roles, he fuses the public persona with the private family narrative, a move that both humanises his character and keeps his real life grounded.However, the public infidelity admission and the Twitch ban highlight how vulnerable this balance can be: personal missteps and business upheavals can bleed into the home. The couple’s decision to pause the stream and work on their relationship shows that they view their relationship as primary, with the streaming brand secondary when needed. Ultimately, balancing streaming and marriage for Dr Disrespect looks like delegating public performance to the persona while ensuring the private sphere has structure, support and trust.In conclusion, Dr Disrespect’s marriage and family life are quietly integral to the success and sustainability of his streaming career. While his on-screen character thrives on attention and controversy, his off-screen life depends on discretion, consistency and a supportive partner. The marriage to Mrs Assassin and their shared parenting of their daughter provide the anchor that allows his high-octane streaming world to continue without completely overwhelming the personal. In the streaming era, finding equilibrium between public spectacle and private stability is one of the most challenging and most revealing aspects of a creator’s life.Also Read: Who is the Dezhou man at the center of China’s viral lottery and live-streamer scandal?","Dr Disrespect has been married to his wife, known online as Mrs Assassin, since around 2013.

Veterinarian criticizes Hasan Piker for using electronic collar on dog Kaya during streams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/veterinarian-criticizes-hasan-piker-for-using-electronic-collar-on-dog-kaya-during-streams/articleshow/124710116.cms,"Image Via Hasan Piker's Instagram

Vet says Hasan Piker’s on-stream handling of Kaya amounts to

animal abuse

Wider implications and expert recommendations





A practicing veterinarian has ignited debate online after analyzing Twitch streamer Hasan Piker’s treatment of his dog, Kaya, during livestreams. The vet, known as CatalystVet, reviewed multiple clips showing the Tibetan Mastiff confined to a raised bed for extended periods while Piker streamed. In one instance, he appeared to activate a handheld remote linked to Kaya’s electronic collar, prompting concerns about animal welfare.CatalystVet published a detailed video analysis describing Piker’s handling of Kaya as animal abuse. The veterinarian argued that forcing a large-breed dog to stay motionless for hours and using an aversive collar to correct harmless behaviors, such as shifting position or standing up, constitutes a violation of basic welfare standards.The vet emphasized that the issue goes beyond whether the collar delivered a vibration or a shock. According to CatalystVet, any negative stimulus used to punish benign movement is a misuse of training tools. The analysis also pointed out that large guardian breeds like Tibetan Mastiffs need freedom of movement to avoid joint stiffness and muscle strain. Restricting such dogs for long durations, especially during hours-long broadcasts, can cause both physical discomfort and psychological stress.CatalystVet cited professional guidelines from organizations such as the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, which discourage aversive training methods and advocate for positive reinforcement techniques. These groups warn that punishment-based approaches, especially when applied to normal behavior, can increase anxiety, fear, and confusion in dogs.While Hasan Piker has mentioned Kaya’s exercise routines and care in past streams, the vet’s critique focused specifically on her enforced immobility during live sessions and the use of an electronic collar as correction. The viral video has since spread widely across social media, reigniting discussions about responsible pet training and streamer accountability.The veterinarian’s claims have added a new dimension to the ongoing controversy surrounding Hasan Piker and his dog Kaya. Though Piker maintains that the collar only vibrates and denies any abusive intent, the expert analysis has fueled renewed scrutiny over how online personalities balance content creation with the ethical treatment of their pets.",CatalystVet published a detailed video analysis describing Piker’s handling of Kaya as animal abuse.

Abu Dhabi launches new traffic Black Points and licence reinstatement campaign: Here's what every motorist must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-launches-new-traffic-black-points-and-licence-reinstatement-campaign-heres-what-every-motorist-must-know/articleshow/124688843.cms,"Abu Dhabi Police introduce a new program to reduce traffic Black Points and reinstate suspended driving licences. Image: AI Representative Image.

Black Points system: How does the new program work?

Steps to avail services

Visit the Abu Dhabi Police platform on the first floor of Mushrif Mall Centre during the program period. Choose between point reduction (if under 24 points) or licence reinstatement (if suspended). Pay the applicable fee (Dh 800 for reduction, Dh 2,400 for reinstatement). Attend the educational courses and workshops in person. Complete the program to have points reduced or licence reinstated.

Abu Dhabi's context for broader traffic safety

Quick recap

Date Time Location Eligibility Service Process Mode Fee (AED) Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with fewer than 24 black points Reduce Black Points Attend traffic safety workshops In-person only 800 Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with suspended licences (24+ points) Reinstate Licence Enroll in rehabilitation courses and complete education In-person only 2,400





Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences, running from October 20 to November 20, 2025. This one-month program operates daily between 4 pm and 10 pm at the Mushrif Mall Centre, first-floor Police platform, and aims to promote safer roads through education, making it easier for motorists to rectify violations.Black points are demerit points given out for serious traffic violations and accumulate according to how dangerous the offence is. Once a driver hits 24 points within a year, their licence usually gets suspended. This program gives drivers two clear options: lower their black points or reinstate a suspended licence.If you have fewer than 24 black points, you can attend specially designed workshops and educational courses to reduce up to eight points from your record. These sessions focus on educating drivers about traffic rules, safe driving habits, and the consequences of violations. The fee for this course is Dh800.For those whose licences have been suspended after surpassing 24 points, the route to reinstatement involves enrolling in a more comprehensive rehabilitation course. Upon successful completion and payment of Dh2,400, your driving licence can be restored. This educative approach helps ensure that reinstated drivers are better informed and more cautious moving forward.Importantly, the program is strictly an in-person affair. Motorists must physically be present at the Mushrif Mall Centre during the dates and timings because there is no online registration or virtual participation option. This ensures that participants get the full benefit of interacting with trainers and engaging in the corrective sessions.The initiative clearly reflects Abu Dhabi Police’s ongoing dedication to community safety by actively encouraging voluntary compliance and shared responsibility rather than resorting solely to fines and suspensions. It also builds on earlier successful efforts such as similar awareness programs launched at major events like the Abu Dhabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition (ADIHEX) earlier in the year.Black point penalties continue to stay on a driver’s record for one year, and avoiding violations during that time can help clear them. Drivers also have the ability to contest fines or have points transferred if the actual offender is identified. Along with various awareness campaigns, such as “A Day Without Accident,” these efforts collectively aim at fostering a safer road environment for all.In summary, Abu Dhabi aims to encourage safer driving habits, reduce accidents, and improve overall road safety. Mark your calendar, take advantage of this important initiative and get your driving record back on track.","Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences.

UAE education reform 2025-26: Schools to roll-out diagnostic assessments and new evaluation methods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-education-reform-2025-26-schools-to-roll-out-diagnostic-assessments-and-new-evaluation-methods/articleshow/124667036.cms,"UAE launches new diagnostic assessments in schools to track student progress, personalise learning, and bridge performance gaps early on / AI-generated illustration

What are these diagnostic assessments and why now?

How the assessments will work: Timing, subjects and implementation

What it means for students, parents and teachers

Challenges and what to watch for





UAE schools are stepping into the new academic year with a smarter approach to learning, introducing diagnostic assessments that spot students’ strengths and weaknesses early on. Starting this term, the Ministry of Education will roll out the new system across public schools, aiming to close learning gaps before they grow and help teachers tailor lessons to every child’s needs.Starting the 2025-26 academic year, schools across the Ministry of Education – UAE will introduce new diagnostic assessments early in the term, specifically designed to identify learning gaps and support targeted teaching. These assessments will help teachers and schools understand each child’s individual strengths and weaknesses from the outset, rather than waiting until end-term exams.This move comes amid broader education reforms in the UAE, including the rollout of an AI curriculum and revised assessment policy.The diagnostic assessments will take place during the early weeks of the term, across key subjects such as Arabic, English and Mathematics for core grades (4-11) in public schools.For example, the first phase of a standardised proficiency test covers 26,000 students in Grades 4–11. Additionally, the exam schedule is re-structured: centralised tests now occur only in the first and third semesters, while the second semester moves to school-based assessments. The aim: teachers get early feedback, adapt teaching, and support students before gaps widen.For students, the change means less waiting and more support. Teachers will receive data early on to tailor lessons and interventions. Parents will have clearer insight into how their child is performing from the start. Schools gain a data-driven foundation to allocate resources and target help where it’s most needed. For teachers, this means working with richer feedback and adjusting lesson pacing and methods. Schools say diagnostic checks help them “identify learning gaps and provide tailored support before the next phase.”For the system, it signals a shift from high-stakes, end-of-term judgments to ongoing, formative evaluation, aimed at deeper learning rather than rote memorisation.While the initiative is promising, success depends on consistent implementation. Schools will need training, reliable data systems, and clarity around how the diagnostic results are used. Teachers may need professional development to interpret the data and act on it effectively. The Ministry has already rolled out training programmes for thousands of educators ahead of the year. There is also a need to ensure equity: private and public schools alike must have access and capacity for these assessments. Monitoring how the data translates into real improvement will be key.With the launch of early diagnostic assessments in the UAE’s 2025-26 school year, the education system is moving from reactive to proactive. By spotting learning gaps at the start, supporting students from day one and giving teachers better tools, the country hopes to raise outcomes, reduce pressure and build a foundation for future-ready learning.","UAE schools are introducing diagnostic assessments that spot students’ strengths and weaknesses early on.

This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Talent exodus complicating Apple’s AI challenges further

Spring launch window for iOS 26.4 and the new Siri remains uncertain









Apple engineers testing an early version of iOS 26.4 have raised concerns about the performance of the long-awaited Siri overhaul, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter. The update, expected to launch in spring 2026, will introduce a revamped AI-powered voice assistant, but internal feedback suggests the technology may not be ready for its public debut.Gurman reported that testers are uneasy about Siri's performance in the iOS 26.4 builds, though specific details about the shortcomings remain unclear. The update was originally planned for iOS 18.4 last year before Apple delayed it, giving the company additional months to refine the technology.The technical concerns arrive amid broader turmoil within Apple's AI division, which has experienced significant departures including Ke Yang, who led the company's Answers, Knowledge and Information team. Yang departed for Meta just weeks after assuming the role following his predecessor Robby Walker's exit.The Apple Foundation Models team has lost its leader and approximately a dozen key researchers, while questions persist about AI chief John Giannandrea's future at the company.Giannandrea's responsibilities have gradually decreased, with Siri moving to the software group and robotics shifting to hardware.When Apple previewed the new Siri at WWDC 2024, the company promised three main capabilities: on-screen awareness, personal context, and in-app controls. During a post-WWDC interview, software chief Craig Federighi stated the team needed time to rearchitect Siri.Apple reportedly has two teams pursuing different approaches—one using on-device models and another using Google Gemini on Private Cloud Compute. With iOS 26.4 likely arriving in March or April, Apple has approximately five to six months to address the performance issues before the public release.The development raises questions about whether Apple can deliver a competitive AI assistant after multiple delays and internal restructuring.","Engineers testing an early version of iOS 26.4 have raised concerns about the performance of the long-awaited Siri overhaul.
