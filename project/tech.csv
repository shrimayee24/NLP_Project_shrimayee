Is Taylor Swift too ‘white bread’ for Coachella’s cool crowd? Exploring the pop queen’s place in festival culture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-taylor-swift-too-white-bread-for-coachellas-cool-crowd-exploring-the-pop-queens-place-in-festival-culture/articleshow/120382497.cms,"Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella (Image via Getty Images)

Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella’s indie vibe?

When it comes to music festivals like Coachella, image matters just as much as the music. It’s not just about who performs—it’s about who belongs. So when Taylor Swift is rumored to make an appearance or even perform, one question keeps popping up: is Taylor Swift too “white bread” for Coachella’s trend-setting, genre-bending scene?On paper, Taylor Swift has the résumé to own any stage. With record-breaking albums, a sold-out Eras Tour, and a massive global fanbase, she’s arguably the biggest pop star on the planet. But Coachella is more than just a concert—it’s a cultural moment, curated for cool. It’s where edgy, experimental, and often underground artists get their shine. It’s where alternative fashion reigns and mainstream pop can sometimes feel… out of place.So why the “white bread” label? It stems from the perception that Taylor’s music—despite its evolution—is still rooted in polished, safe storytelling. While she’s dabbled in indie folk with Folklore and Evermore, and even worked with edgy producers like Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, some still see her as the girl-next-door in a world full of rebellious misfits.Yet that assumption overlooks her savvy reinventions. Taylor has consistently pushed boundaries in her own way—whether it’s re-recording her masters to reclaim her artistry, calling out industry sexism, or subtly weaving political themes into her music. She’s clean-cut, yes, but not without edge. Maybe she’s not flipping off the crowd in a studded leather jacket—but she’s rewriting the rules in a sparkly bodysuit, and doing it on her own terms.The reality is, Coachella has changed too. The lineup now spans everything from reggaeton and K-pop to hip-hop and house. The festival has become a melting pot of genres and identities. If Blink-182, Billie Eilish, and Bad Bunny can all share the same stage, why not Taylor?Also Read: Did Taylor Swift skip Coachella 2025 to avoid being upstaged by other stars? Fans question her absence amid rising speculation Whether she ever headlines or just shows up to support friends (like boyfriend Travis Kelce or producer pals), her presence sparks conversation. And maybe that’s the point. Because if Taylor Swift isn’t Coachella enough—then maybe it’s time to ask what Coachella really stands for in 2025.After all, being too “white bread” might just be the boldest thing you can be in a world obsessed with crust.","Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella’s indie vibe?

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are keeping a low profile because they are busy taking their much-deserved and much-needed break from the Eras Tour and the NFL’s Super Bowl. Amidst their break, a photo has been circulating like wildfire on the X platform. The photo goes back to one of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour shows. Taylor Swift posed with Leanne Lucas on the backstage. Leanne Lucas is a real-life hero for many children - she helped survive a terrorist attack at Hart Spade Studio. An X user commented on the pic of Taylor Swift and Leanne Lucas, “Leanne’s courage and Taylor’s compassion together make this so inspiring.”Taylor Swift’s kind gesture of taking her time out and interacting with Leanne Lucas and wearing the friendship bracelet with Lucas swooned everyone. One X user loved the gesture adopted by the Fortnight singer, “Taylor wearing the bracelet is such a beautiful gesture of respect and support.” Another X user wrote, “Taylor showing up with heart and humility—this is the kind of kindness that truly speaks louder than words.” A third X user was surprised this photo did not come up during the Eras Tour, “and ppl leak this now 😭” A fourth X user is missing her shows, music, and everything, “i’ve never felt deeper longing than this take me back to our kingdom lights 😫”A throwback picture of billionaire pop singer Taylor Swift and a real-life hero, Leanne Lucas, takes us back to the terrifying incident that happened at Southport.

I’m an avid Taylor Swift fan, so it suited me as well.”Leanne Lucas, along with her best friend and dance teacher, Heidi, arranged a Taylor Swift-themed yoga and dance workshop on July 29, 2024. “I’d always have activities in my workshop, and, it made sense to make friendship bracelets because that’s what Taylor Swift sings about.” continued Leanne Lucas.Leanne Lucas was stabbed five times by Axel Rudakubana.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all- female space mission.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Poll Should archaeological sites be preserved for historical and religious significance? Only if funds are available Absolutely, they are vital

Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden, aligning with biblical accounts . The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

"CIA’s declassified files reveal Cold War-era plans involving condoms, mind control, fake sex tapes and psychic experiments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cias-declassified-files-reveal-cold-war-era-plans-involving-condoms-mind-control-fake-sex-tapes-and-psychic-experiments/articleshow/120367717.cms,"Recently declassified CIA documents revealed a strange and disturbing history of covert operations that veered into the surreal, according to a New York Post report. From psychological warfare using misleading condoms to failed mind control experiments and bizarre plots involving sex tapes and demonic action figures, these records expose the extremes the agency explored during and after the Cold War.One of the most unusual plans, dating back to the 1950s, involved airdropping extra-large condoms labelled “small” or “medium” over Soviet territories to intimidate enemy soldiers and lower morale. While the CIA had previously dropped propaganda pamphlets via weather balloons, this specific tactic was never implemented.In another covert attempt at psychological warfare, the CIA in 2005 commissioned GI Joe creator Donald Levine to design an Osama Bin Laden action figure with a face that would peel off in sunlight to reveal a demonic visage. “The action figure idea was proposed and rejected by the CIA before it got past the prototype stage,” the agency told the New York Post in 2014. Only three prototypes were ever made.The CIA also allegedly produced a pornographic film titled Happy Days in the mid-20th century, featuring an American actor in a mask portraying Indonesian President Achmed Sukarno. The goal was to frame it as a Soviet blackmail ploy to embarrass the leader. But, according to reports, Sukarno was unbothered — even amused — and reportedly arranged for the film’s distribution in Indonesia.Among the most notorious CIA initiatives was Project MKUltra , launched in 1953, which aimed to explore mind control through 149 secret experiments. Some of these were conducted without subjects' consent. In one extreme case, a Kentucky patient was allegedly given LSD for 179 consecutive days. Another experiment involved hypnotising women to commit acts of violence, with no memory of the events afterwards. Most MKUltra files were destroyed in 1973, but the surviving records paint a grim picture of unethical and at times criminal behaviour.The CIA’s interest in controlling living beings wasn’t limited to humans. In 1963, it carried out mind control experiments on dogs by implanting electrodes into their brains, allowing handlers to direct their movements remotely. Declassified files cited by The Black Vault show dogs being steered to run, stop or turn using electrical signals. The programme was eventually discontinued.The bizarre didn’t stop there. In the 1970s, the CIA backed Project Stargate, which investigated the military use of psychic powers. Uri Geller, a self-proclaimed psychic, was tested under controlled conditions and reportedly guessed concealed drawings and words with eerie precision. “[Geller’s] almost immediate response was that he saw a ‘cylinder with noise coming out of it’,” CIA documentation noted. Despite years of funding, the agency eventually concluded the project offered no strategic benefit.One of the CIA’s most controversial programmes was Operation Paperclip , launched after World War II. It brought over 1,600 former Nazi scientists — including SS officers — into the United States to help counter Soviet advances. Figures like Wernher von Braun and Kurt Debus were instrumental in the US space programme, despite their Nazi affiliations. Their recruitment caused unrest among American scientists, as described in Star Bound by Emily Carney and Bruce McCandless III.","Newly declassified CIA documents reveal bizarre and disturbing history of covert operations that veered into the surreal.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Walmart’s online store is back up and running after a major outage left thousands of customers unable to browse products or complete purchases. The disruption, which began around 3:00 p.m. ET, affected both the Walmart website and mobile app, preventing users from searching for items or adding them to their carts.Reports from Downdetector showed over 3,600 outage complaints at the peak of the incident. Customers took to social media platforms like X to express frustration, with many encountering error messages such as “We’re having technical issues , but we’ll be back in a flash.”While Walmart has not officially commented on the cause of the outage, some experts speculate that it may have been server-related or linked to routine maintenance issues.By 6:45 p.m. ET, reports of outages had dropped significantly, with most users able to search for products, access category pages, and complete transactions. Some customers noted that functionality was restored gradually, with certain features coming back online before others.The outage follows similar disruptions experienced by Zoom and Spotify earlier this week, raising concerns about widespread technical failures across major platforms.As Walmart continues to monitor its systems, customers are advised to refresh their browsers or update their apps if they still encounter issues.","Walmart's online store is back up and running after a major outage left thousands of customers unable to browse products or complete purchases.

Facebook parent Meta has escalated its rivalry with Apple, a report claims. The Mark Zuckerberg-led social media major is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The report claims that users are unable to access Apple’s AI features, such as Writing Tools and Genmoji, on Meta apps. The decision follows Apple’s announcement that developers could opt in or out of AI integration with iOS 18 and its subsequent rollout in October 2024. Users have reported that even basic functions like text rewriting and AI‑generated custom emoji no longer appear in Meta’s apps, despite being enabled in the app settings.According to a report by the Brazilian blog Sorcererhat Tech, the lack of access was confirmed through testing on Instagram, where these features could not be accessed even with Apple Intelligence settings enabled within the app. Apple Intelligence first became available with ios 18.1 last October, offering built‑in tools across most iPhone apps by default. The block also extends to keyboard stickers and Memoji in Instagram Stories—features that were previously accessible within the app.The move aligns with reports that Meta is steering users toward its own AI suite, Meta AI , which is integrated across its platforms. Meta AI offers similar text‑editing and image‑generation tools directly within its apps, including caption suggestions on Instagram. The company’s refusal to adopt Apple Intelligence highlights a growing divide between the two tech ecosystems over control of AI‑driven user experiences.A Wall Street Journal report from June 2024 reveals that Apple and Meta explored integrating Facebook’s AI model into iOS 18 as part of Apple Intelligence, but Apple declined the proposal over privacy concerns and instead struck a deal with OpenAI to offer optional ChatGPT responses via Siri.Given their history of clashes—from device‑interoperability demands to App Store disputes—it follows that Meta would opt to exclude Apple’s AI tools from its apps. Meta has since rolled out its suite of AI features across its platforms.Earlier this year, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that Apple has fallen short on innovation and relies too much on the enduring success of the iPhone.""Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,"" Zuckerberg said, pointing to a slowdown in iPhone upgrades, as many users no longer see enough improvements in each new model to justify buying the latest device.","Facebook parent Meta is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments.

To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.
