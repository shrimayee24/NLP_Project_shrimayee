Winnipeg Jets are willing to make a serious commitment

Where could Jonathan Toews end up next season? | OverDrive Clips | 06/11/25

Colorado Avalanche still strongly in the mix



Jonathan Toews is expected to decide soon as negotiations begin.







Jonathan Toews is inching closer to a highly anticipated NHL comeback. Once eyed by four teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning, he has reportedly cut his list in half. Now, all eyes are on two Western Conference teams, the Winnipeg Jets and Colorado Avalanche, as Toews prepares to negotiate a deal.Toews returning to his hometown is more than just a feel-good narrative; it’s now a serious possibility. For Winnipeg, bringing in Toews would not only boost leadership and experience but also serve as a powerful symbol for the franchise. With the team looking to re-establish itself as a strong postseason contender, Toews could be the missing piece that stabilizes the locker room and adds playoff grit.While the Jets offer sentiment and hometown appeal, the Colorado Avalanche bring title ambitions. Despite earlier assumptions that the Avalanche had moved on after acquiring Brock Nelson, Dreger clarified that his Colorado sources insisted they remain very, very interested in Toews. The front office views him as a cultural fit who can strengthen their leadership group.The Avalanche are still hunting another deep playoff run, and a healthy Toews could add the veteran savvy they lacked last season.With uncertainty around their bottom six and leadership depth, Toews’ return could round out their roster.Toews’ comeback story has moved from speculation to strategy. With a decision reportedly between just two teams, negotiations are expected to begin in earnest. The timing suggests he wants a deal wrapped up before the July 1 free agency window, allowing him to integrate into his new team early.Read more: Who is Quinn Hughes girlfriend?

NHL insider reveals NHL and NHLPA are talking about new cap rules for playoffs





Why NHL teams and fans are paying close attention to this salary cap talk

Every NHL season brings intense playoff battles, but behind the scenes, there’s growing talk about something else, money rules. A recent report reveals that the league and the players’ union are in early talks to change how playoff salaries work. While nothing is final, one key insider has now explained the possible changes. And if approved, it could affect how teams are built for the postseason.On June 17, 2025, sports journalist Chris Johnston discussed a new topic on The Chris Johnston Show that has caught the attention of hockey fans. He shared that both the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) are now in talks about setting some kind of “playoff salary cap.”Right now, the salary cap only applies during the regular season. But once the playoffs begin, teams are free to use players coming off long-term injuries, even if that pushes their total salary far above the usual limit. This has created what many call a “loophole,” and some teams have been criticized for using it to their advantage.Johnston said, “This is something that’s at the discussion stage… but there is a desire to at least look at changes.”No rule has been passed yet, but if the idea moves forward, it could stop teams from using certain tricks to get stronger just in time for playoffs.In recent years when clubs such the Tampa Bay Lightning employed the existing method to include star players during the postseason, this issue grew front and center. Many thought it was unjust even though the rules permitted what they did. Some fans believe this gives an advantage to rich or smart teams that can work around the cap.Also Read: NHL Salary Cap Loophole Gives Teams Like Dallas And Florida Extra Leverage: Report The NHL and NHLPA have not confirmed any changes, but sources from Sportsnet and TSN confirm that these talks are real. If a playoff cap is created, it would mean teams can only spend up to a set amount during the postseason, just like in the regular season.So far, there’s no word on when a final decision will come. But as next season draws near, several think the league should move swiftly to prevent more controversy. Everybody is now waiting to see if the NHL and NHLPA agree on a new playoff salary restriction.","NHL insider reveals NHL and NHLPA are talking about new cap rules for playoffs.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, “This Is Not My Business” - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that’s ‘one habit’ you shouldn’t copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs’ decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs’ legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn’t just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. “He would call — especially the producers — at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Docter revealed. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”This intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. “That’s what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,” he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. “Who wouldn’t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?” Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter’s reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn’t about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn’t just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.",Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million.

Dating apps turn into free food platforms with 'foodie calls' on the rise



Social media reacts to new dating trend ‘foodie call’



Is it being smart or just selfish? What the research suggests



When dating becomes a strategy for surviving city life



Also Read |

Dating in the digital age is evolving fast, and not always in the way you’d expect. Forget candlelit connections and heartfelt chats with today’s new dating ritual, swiping right with one thing in mind: food. With inflation tightening wallets and brunch prices soaring, a cheeky new trend called the “foodie call” is taking over dating apps . Instead of searching for love, many are hunting for their next free meal. Popular on TikTok and beyond, users openly admit to going on dates just to enjoy a good restaurant and no matching or compatibility required. It’s dating with a side of strategy, and the internet can’t stop talking about a new dating trend or a new foodie strategy?These apps that were once meant to bring about romantic relationships are being comparably joked about as DoorDash by those who use them to fill their bellies, rather than their hearts. A "" foodie call "" is when a person will accept a date for the purpose of getting a free meal, but with no plans to take things further in terms of a relationship, or even a second date.According to the New York Post reports, South Carolina graphic designer Katheryne Slack admitted in an interview on MarketWatch that she asked a Hinge match out for coffee not due to interest, but because she was out at home. They hadn't talked in days, but when she could make it work, she met him at a coffee shop. ""As soon as I met him, I knew I wasn't into him. But I was already there and needed my coffee,"" she said.Social media has escalated the trend. Hilarious videos under hashtags such as #datingfordinner or #foodiecall feature young women ostentatiously documenting their dating lives, highlighting the number of free dinners they have received in a week.In one of the viral videos, @jocelynaleenaa posted, ""When you keep going on dates for the free food & drinks,"" while others cracked jokes about not having to do grocery shopping at all by making back-to-back dates a meal prep. In another video, a lady was dancing to the caption: ""Off on my second date this week 'cause I can't be bothered to meal prep.""To others, it's a ""budget hack"" in times of economic uncertainty, even when it's a bit of a gray area morally.Although ""foodie calls"" may look like and feel like cheeky behavior, researchers contend there could be darker psychological tendencies involved. The journal Society for Personality and Social Psychology published a study in 2019 that reported that as many as 1 in 3 women acknowledged going out on dates for free food alone. More significantly, persons who habitually make such calls ranked higher in the ""dark triad"" traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. These are persons who usually take advantage of social situations and have no guilt for being deceitful.With rents that are through the roof and an endless roster of hip restaurants, urban areas such as New York have become breeding ground for ""dinner dating."" East Village resident Olivia Balsinger described dining on a five-course meal at the pricey Catch restaurant in the Meatpacking District that is all on her date's bill. ""If I had had to pay,"" she confessed, ""I probably wouldn't have been able to eat for weeks afterwards. Though the ritual may seem innocent or even sly in the view of some, others see it as emotional manipulation. The unaware date not only pays the bill but often ends up confused or disappointed, unaware they were never a romantic player in the first place.","Dating apps that were once meant to bring about romantic relationships are being joked about as DoorDash by those who use them to fill their bellies, rather than their hearts.

Why Trump’s America-made T1 Mobile is a far-fetched reality



President Donald Trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, Trump Mobile, just weeks after threatening Apple and Samsung with steep tariffs unless they move production to the United States. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his ""America First"" manufacturing rhetoric while offering consumers a domestic alternative to foreign-made devices.Donald Trump's flagship device, the T1 Phone 8002 (Gold version), carries a $499 price tag and can be reserved with a $100 down payment for September delivery. The phone is marketed as ""designed and built in the USA,"" positioning it as the patriotic choice Trump has been demanding from major manufacturers.The launch comes after Trump's May threat to impose ""at least 25 percent"" tariffs on iPhones and similar devices manufactured overseas. He specifically targeted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating that iPhones sold in America must be manufactured domestically, not in India or elsewhere. Trump extended the tariff threat to ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product,"" as he told White House reporters, with implementation potentially beginning at the end of June. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his broader commitment to reshoring technology manufacturing.The T1 Phone 8002 boasts some impressive hardware for its price, including a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, 256GB storage, 12GB RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery. The device features three rear cameras led by a 50MP main sensor, Android 15, and notably includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rarity among modern smartphones.However, the Trump Mobile website doesn't tell much about the smartphone, and displays what appears to be heavily manipulated product images. No processor is listed despite a dedicated section on the specifications page, a critical omission for any smartphone launch.Industry observers note that the September delivery timeline seems optimistic given the typical 12-18 month development cycle for new smartphones. The Trump Mobile venture requires customers to place $100 deposits for pre-orders, with the remainder due upon delivery.Trump's assertion that the phone is manufactured domestically contradicts industry consensus about smartphone production capabilities in the United States. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that domestic iPhone production faces significant infrastructure and supply chain challenges.Currently, virtually no smartphone manufacturers, including those based in the US, produce their devices on American soil. The complex supply chains and specialized manufacturing capabilities required for modern smartphones remain concentrated in Asia, particularly China, despite ongoing efforts by companies like Apple to diversify production to countries like India.","Donald Trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, Trump Mobile.

AI Godfather’s urgent warning: Want job security? Learn plumbing

A personal warning from the AI Godfather

Office jobs face AI pressure, says ‘Godfather of AI’

Growing inequality could be the real problem

A future that’s still unwritten

In a world moving quickly toward automation, one of the creators of modern artificial intelligence is raising serious concerns about what happens next. Geoffrey Hinton , the British-Canadian computer scientist often called the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk—and which ones might survive.Hinton, who helped lay the foundation for AI systems that now power everything from chatbots to medical tools, left his role at Google in 2023. Since then, he’s been speaking more freely about the risks of the technology he helped create. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett, Hinton discussed the future of work in a world shaped by powerful machines. And in a surprising turn, he said there’s one career path that may be safer than most: plumbing.While talking about the risks of AI, Hinton made a simple point: machines are good at thinking, not at fixing pipes. “It’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us,” he said. “A good bet would be to be a plumber.”Plumbing is hard to automate. It involves manual skill, real-world judgment, and problem-solving in unpredictable settings. A plumber might need to crawl under a sink, deal with unusual water pressure, or fix something without a manual. These aren’t tasks AI systems are built to handle.According to Hinton, jobs that rely on hands-on skills are less likely to be taken over by AI anytime soon. While machines can handle large amounts of data and even draft documents, they still can’t climb ladders or tighten valves. That gives trade jobs—especially ones like plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry—an edge in the AI era.Now 77, Hinton didn’t try to hide how conflicted he feels. He admitted that he’s still processing the full consequences of his work. “Intellectually, you can see the threat,” he said. “But it’s very hard to come to terms with it emotionally.”He said he worries about the future his children and grandchildren might face. In the interview, he painted a picture that was both realistic and unsettling. He talked about a world where AI systems could eventually control power plants and critical infrastructure. If these systems become fully independent, they may not need people at all.“If AI ever decided to take over,” he warned, “it would need people for a while to run the power stations—until it designed better analog machines… There are so many ways it could get rid of people, all of which would, of course, be very nasty.”Hinton didn’t say this will happen. But he made it clear that it could. And in his view, that’s reason enough to take it seriously.While plumbers may be safe for now, Hinton believes many office jobs won’t be. He pointed to legal assistants and paralegals as some of the first roles being reshaped by AI.These jobs often involve reviewing contracts, analyzing documents, or summarizing information—all tasks that large language models can already handle. With AI tools now able to draft legal text and even predict case outcomes, the need for human support roles in law firms could shrink.Hinton wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He was simply stating what the data shows. “In a society which shared out things fairly, everybody should be better off,” he said. “But if you can replace lots of people by AIs, then the people who get replaced will be worse off.”In other words, the shift may boost productivity, but it might not help everyone equally.Beyond the risks of job loss, Hinton pointed to a deeper issue: inequality. As companies adopt AI, many workers may be pushed out, while only a small group—those who own or run these companies—stand to benefit.If not managed carefully, this could lead to a wider gap between rich and poor. People in manual jobs may still find work, but others—especially those in mid-level white-collar roles—may struggle to adapt.And while AI might create new jobs, Hinton warned that the pace of change could be too fast for many to keep up.Hinton’s message wasn’t meant to scare people. It was meant to make them think. He didn’t claim to know how the future will unfold. But he said it’s time to have an honest conversation about what’s coming.For now, the most valuable skills may not be digital ones—but physical ones. Fixing a leak, rewiring a switchboard, or installing a water heater might be harder to replace than people think.And that’s something worth remembering.","Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk.

"APIs used to connect systems digitally, now AI agents will",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/apis-used-to-connect-systems-digitally-now-ai-agents-will/articleshow/121921869.cms,"CHANGING SKILL SETS



For decades, the humble API has been the plumbing that lets far-flung digital services speak to one another. A clean endpoint, a crisp schema, and the world’s software snapped together like Lego. It’s how your Whatsapp account connects to your Gmail service, and how most websites and applications talk to each other. Now that tidy requestresponse universe is being rattled by autonomous AI agents—programmes that do not merely answer a call but decide, reason and negotiate on our behalf. As the old choreography frays, software engineers now need to update their skills to help these agentic systems communicate effectively with each other.“We’re already seeing this shift building software at Katalon. Instead of rigid API contracts, we’re designing how AI agents negotiate with each other—how they handle failures, share context, and maintain consistency across workflows,” says Coty Rosenblath, chief technology officer at the low-code testing specialist. “Traditional APIs assume you control both endpoints, but with AI agents making independent decisions, protocols need to handle that uncertainty.”Microsoft’s India innovation hub CTO Sandeep Alur agrees that APIs are ceding the stage. “As AI agents become the new building blocks of software, the future of engineering is shifting from designing APIs to orchestrating intelligent agents,” he remarks, pointing to emerging standards such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication that redefine how systems communicate, collaborate and scale.“MCP provides a standardised way for AI models to interact with external tools, enabling real-time data access, tool integration, and reasoning across services. A2A enables structured collaboration between agents across platforms, clouds, and organisations, using shared goals, secure state management, and observable actions.”Essentially, A2A allows agents to talk to each other while MCP allows agents to talk to other software.Prompt engineering, once the darling skill of the ChatGPT boom, is already becoming passé. “Prompt engineering was just the start,” observes Rosenblath. “The challenge now is getting multiple AI agents to work together reliably.”Santosh Singh, president & global head of marketing & business excellence at Tata Technologies, puts it more lyrically: “Prompt engineering is the spark—but agent orchestration is the symphony. The engineer of tomorrow will design conversations between intelligent collaborators.”From the vantage point of big tech companies, orchestrating an endless multitude of AI agents hinges on secure, multi-protocol integration, something software developers of all stripes should keep in mind during their next job interview.“Future engineers must excel in designing multi-protocol integrations that are secure and adhere to boundaries or frameworks, preventing information leakage,” says Vishal Chahal, vice-president at IBM India Software Labs. He expects prompt templates, formulated by small language models, to direct agents towards task completion, shifting the engineer’s craft from writing prompts to fine-tuning specialist models and weaving them into enterprise architecture.If the tools are changing, so too is the tool-box. Rosenblath believes success will belong to those who can break complex objectives into smaller tasks that agents can pursue independently but still align with an overall objective, designing how they share context, remember past interactions, and evaluate each other’s outputs. Validation steps and feedback loops—long the preserve of quality assurance—become central to day-to-day engineering.IBM’s Chahal unfurls a similar skills list: “A solid understanding of how to automate tasks and processes, an understanding of machine-learning algorithms, the ability to craft effective prompts for AI models and APIs are crucial. Also, familiarity with integration tools is necessary for seamlessly combining AI capabilities with existing systems.” Vision, too, matters. “Intuitive or imaginative skills to envision how the agent will respond in various scenarios is important.”Pavan Gurazada, adjunct lecturer at Northwestern University and senior faculty at Great Learning, divides tomorrow’s workforce into tool builders and agent builders. The former will expose services as tools using standardised protocols like MCP. The latter will compose and orchestrate these tools to create agents that automate end-to-end workflows. Engineers, he predicts, will need to map complex business processes into agentbased workflows and ensure they align with evolving corporate goals.Sameer Goyal, head of engineering at Acuity Knowledge Partners, thinks systems thinking will be essential to understand how local interactions can produce emergent, sophisticated behaviors at scale. “All things considered, organising agents is a confluence of distributed computing, cognitive science, and systems design rather than just an extension of current AI activities. Engineers who master this intersection will be highly sought after in the years to come.”And as much as this is still an evolving field, companies are already looking for these skills today. PaySprint’s founder and CEO S Anand says they are actively on the lookout for these skill sets in potential hires for the company. “We’re looking for individuals that can function across evolving fronts — from AI logic and machine learning to business-aligned strategy and orchestration.”","Software engineers need to update their skills to help these agentic systems communicate effectively with each other.

What Microsoft has to say



The Better Business Bureau 's National Advertising Division has called out Microsoft for its confusing overuse of "" Copilot "" branding across AI products, recommending the company modify its advertising claims and clarify product functionality differences. Microsoft disagrees with the findings but says it will comply with the watchdog's recommendations.The NAD reviewed Microsoft's Copilot advertising and found that the company's ""universal use of the product description as 'Copilot'"" creates consumer confusion, as customers ""would not necessarily understand the difference"" between various AI tools bearing the same name. The watchdog specifically criticized Microsoft's claim that Copilot works ""seamlessly across all your data,"" noting that Business Chat requires manual copying and pasting to achieve the same functionality as Copilot in individual Office applications.NAD also challenged Microsoft's productivity statistics, recommending the company discontinue or modify claims that ""67%, 70%, and 75% of users say they are more productive"" after using Copilot for extended periods. The watchdog determined that while the study demonstrates perceived productivity improvements, it doesn't provide objective evidence of actual productivity gains.The criticism comes amid Microsoft's years-long branding confusion around Copilot products. The company has repeatedly rebranded its AI tools, with Business Chat evolving from a Teams chatbot to Business Chat for Microsoft 365 Copilot, while Bing Chat Enterprise became simply ""Copilot"" before further rebranding.Microsoft's AI at Work chief marketing officer Jared Spataro defended the company's approach, stating they ""take seriously our responsibility to provide clear, transparent, and accurate information to our customers."" He highlighted customer success stories, including Barclays deploying Copilot to 100,000 employees and Dow identifying millions in potential savings.A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the company disagrees with NAD's conclusions about advertising implications but will follow the recommendations. This latest scrutiny adds to Microsoft's long history of product naming challenges, with employees previously joking that the company would have called Apple's iPod the ""Microsoft I-pod Pro 2005 XP Human Ear Professional Edition with Subscription.""","The Better Business Bureau has called out Microsoft for its confusing overuse of "" Copilot "" branding across AI products.

Barak Magen makes debut: Israel deploys new air defence system against Iranian strikes — How does it work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/barak-magen-makes-debut-israel-deploys-new-air-defence-system-against-iranian-strikes-how-does-it-work/articleshow/121880391.cms,"Iran Executes Mossad's Spy, Arrests Two More As War With Israel Rages

What is the Barak Magen defense system?

Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)

Key capabilities:





Multi-layered protection: Capable of neutralising drones, cruise missiles, sea-skimming missiles, ballistic threats, and even enemy aircraft.





Long-range interception: Utilises the LRAD (Long-Range Active Defense) interceptor missile, which can engage targets at distances exceeding 150 km.





Advanced detection: Integrated with the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR radar, providing 360-degree threat detection and tracking, supported by electro-optical sensors for precision targeting.





Modular architecture: Can be adapted to various platforms, currently deployed on Sa’ar 6-class corvettes, which safeguard Israel’s Exclusive Economic Zone and offshore energy assets.





The Israeli Navy for the first time, successfully west asian countries deployed its Barak Magen air defense system to intercept drones launched from Iran, marking a significant milestone in Israel’s maritime security capabilities amid rising regional tensions.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), eight Iranian drones were intercepted overnight by Sa’ar 6-class missile corvettes patrolling Israel's coastal waters. The interception marked the first operational use of the Barak Magen system and its long-range LRAD interceptor, with all threats neutralised before any damage occurred. “The Navy's missile boat flotilla intercepted eight drones launched from Iran,” the IDF said. “This was the first operational use of the 'Barak Magen' air defense system and the long-range interceptor 'LRAD'.”The engagement unfolded amid an escalation in hostilities between Israel and Iran, with the IDF claiming to have intercepted at least 25 drones since the conflict intensified. The use of drone swarms by Iran reflects a broader strategic shift towards low-cost, expendable unmanned systems to probe and challenge Israeli defences.Deployed aboard the Israeli Navy’s newest Sa’ar 6-class corvettes, the Barak Magen system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to counter a wide spectrum of threats — including drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic projectiles — with high precision and rapid response capabilities.Barak Magen is an advanced naval air defense system developed byto defend warships against a variety of aerial threats in complex maritime environments. Its first public use came in June 2025, when it intercepted Iranian drones targeting Israel.Barak Magen was built to address the rising threat of asymmetric aerial attacks, particularly drone swarms and precision munitions launched by adversaries like Iran and its proxies. Unlike land-based systems such as Iron Dome or David’s Sling, Barak Magen is tailored for naval operations, providing rapid-response defense against incoming threats from both air and sea.The system’s debut signals a doctrinal shift in Israeli defence, prioritising maritime air superiority to secure strategic interests at sea. As offshore gas production grows in importance, systems like Barak Magen offer a critical shield for Israel’s economic infrastructure.Its integration with compact yet heavily armed Sa’ar 6-class warships illustrates a modern naval approach — using agile, multi-role vessels equipped with cutting-edge technology to counter increasingly complex threats.","Barak Magen is an advanced naval air defense system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Its first public use came in June 2025, when it intercepted Iranian drones targeting Israel.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

LaMelo Ball turns heads with massive ink project and a powerful message







Charlotte Hornets star LaMelo Ball is making headlines off the court during the NBA offseason. Ball has dramatically expanded his body art collection. Already known for his bold fashion choices and a distinct personal brand, the 2021-22 All-Star added an eye-popping array of tattoos that has quickly gone viral. The transformation, which reportedly involved multiple sessions and several artists, shows how Ball continues to shape his public image beyond basketball.This offseason, LaMelo Ball took it to another level with a dramatic full-body tattoo expansion. Fans first noticed Ball’s heavily inked arms and chest, but the reveal of his neck and chest piece took social media by storm. He added, ""God Soldier"" with red ink.Tattoo artist Herchell L Carrasco, a Los Angeles-based inker who has worked with Ball for years, shared the latest work on Instagram with the caption: ""Hardest Tattoos in the NBA? @Melo came in for 2 Sessions with my team."" But those sessions were just part of a much larger project. According to Complex, last year, the massive back tattoo— featuring the phrase ""Rare One"" in two different fonts, a UFO, an alien head, and multiple spiritual symbols— took a dedicated crew of six artists to complete.Carrasco revealed that completing the work was a feat in itself. Alongside him were Jorge Garibay, Niz Carillo, Elvis Ramos, Juan Nambo, and Jonas Aguila. The team spent three consecutive days, each with a grueling six-hour session, working on Ball’s back, though he wouldn't disclose the total price tag, only saying it was around $20,000.The symbolism behind the tattoos is personal for Ball. The ""RARE ONE"" phrase across his back stands as a signature mantra he's used throughout his career. A UFO near his neck includes a nod to his LaFrance brand, while spiritual symbols like crosses on his elbows and an alien head further emphasize his eccentric style.Also Read: Family pride fuels Caitlin Clark as she celebrates Italian roots before game with her grandfather in the stands From sharing viral clips to building a clothing empire, LaMelo Ball knows how to generate buzz.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

"Completely Impossible ..., say analysts on claims that Donald Trump's T1 smartphone will be made in America; add: Where are ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/completely-impossible-say-analysts-on-claims-that-donald-trumps-t1-smartphone-will-be-made-in-america-add-where-are-/articleshow/121915210.cms,"The Trump Organization says that the entire device, which costs $499 is assembled in the US, but there is no information on when it will hit stores.

How and where to get the components



Earlier this week, the Trump Organization, owned by the US President Donald Trump, announced the launch of the T1, a gold-colored smartphone priced at $499. The smartphone, which will run on Google’s Android operating system, is being promoted as “built in the United States.” However, industry experts have cast doubt on these claims, suggesting the phone is likely designed and manufactured by a Chinese company. The announcement comes as President Trump has intensified scrutiny on global smartphone supply chains, particularly targeting companies like Apple to move manufacturing to the U.S. amid threats of tariffs on imported devices.Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at International Data Corp. told CNBC that it is “completely impossible” for the T1 to be fully designed and manufactured in the U.S. He and other analysts, including Blake Przesmicki of Counterpoint Research, believe the phone is likely produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM), which designs and builds products to the specifications of other companies. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint, added that the U.S. lacks readily available local manufacturing capabilities for smartphones.Experts also warn that the US-based smartphone production would be a costly and time-intensive endeavor, likely increasing prices significantly.The T1’s specifications further highlight its reliance on global supply chains. The device features a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, likely sourced from South Korean companies Samsung or LG, or Chinese manufacturer BOE. Its 50-megapixel camera is expected to use image sensors from Japan’s Sony, a dominant player in the market. The phone’s processor is likely to come from Taiwan’s MediaTek or Qualcomm, with manufacturing based in Taiwan. While US-based Micron could supply memory components, other suppliers like Samsung may also be involved.“Even with local manufacturing, the T1 will rely on imported components,” Fieldhack noted, underscoring the global nature of smartphone production.","The Trump Organization, owned by the US President Donald Trump, announced the launch of the T1, a gold-colored smartphone priced at $499.

Over 50% meetings are ad-hoc calls: Report

LAVA SHARK 5G: 5 reasons to buy!

Microsoft's latest research paints a troubling picture of modern work life: employees are caught in what the tech giant calls an "" infinite workday "" that starts before dawn and stretches well into the evening. The company's June Work Trend Index Special Report, released on June 17, reveals how digital communication has created an ""always on"" environment that's fragmenting focus time and blurring the boundaries between work and personal life. Based on analysis of trillions of productivity signals from Microsoft 365 users worldwide, the study shows workers are experiencing constant interruptions, with the average employee being pinged every two minutes during work hours.From early morning email triage to late-night meetings, the traditional 9-to-5 workday has evolved into something far more demanding and chaotic. The findings suggest that without a fundamental rethink of how work gets done, artificial intelligence could end up accelerating an already broken system rather than fixing it. Microsoft argues that organizations need to become ""Frontier Firms"" that redesign their processes around AI and human-agent teams to break free from this cycle.The research reveals how dramatically the workday has expanded beyond traditional hours. By 6 am, 40% of early risers are already sorting through their email inboxes, trying to get ahead of the day's demands. The average worker now receives 117 emails and 153 Teams messages daily, creating a constant stream of notifications and interruptions.The problem intensifies as the day progresses. Peak productivity hours between 9-11 am and 1-3 pm – when research shows people naturally have energy spikes – are now dominated by meetings rather than focused work. Tuesday has become the heaviest meeting day, carrying 23% of the week's scheduled calls.Even more concerning is the evening surge. Meetings after 8 pm have jumped 16% year-over-year, and nearly 30% of workers are back in their email by 10 pm. Weekend work is also on the rise, with 20% of employees checking email before noon on weekends.The study highlights how fragmented modern work has become. More than half of all meetings (57%) are now ad-hoc calls without calendar invites, and one in 10 scheduled meetings are booked at the last minute. Large meetings with 65 or more attendees are growing fastest, reflecting increasingly complex cross-functional teams.The coordination challenge is global – nearly a third of meetings now span multiple time zones, up 35% since 2021. This has created what Microsoft calls ""the most overloaded hour of the day"" at 11 am, when messages, meetings, and app switching converge to make focused work nearly impossible.The stress shows in employee behaviour: PowerPoint edits spike 122% in the final 10 minutes before meetings, resembling digital cramming before an exam. Nearly half of employees (48%) say their work feels chaotic and fragmented, with leaders feeling even more overwhelmed at 52%.","Microsoft's June Work Trend Index Special Report, released on June 17, reveals how digital communication has created an ""always on"" environment.

Apple announced the iOS 26 update at WWDC 2025, revealing the "" Liquid Glass "" design. The new look of the OS sparked immediate debate and some playful jabs from tech rivals, particularly Samsung and Microsoft. Google has now entered into the fray by releasing a funny ad that shows a humorous exchange between Google Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro.In the latest ad released by Google, a ""Pixel"" phone persona playfully questions an ""iPhone"" persona about its newly announced iOS 26 features . The ""iPhone"" excitedly describes ""live translation for text messages,"" ""Hold Assist,"" and ""call screening."" Each time, the ""Pixel"" responds by noting it had these features ""four years ago,"" ""five years ago,"" and ""seven years ago,"" respectively.The ""iPhone"" dismisses these resemblances as ""crazy coincidences"" and ""so wild,"" culminating in the ""iPhone"" innocently asking what the ""Pixel"" is working on for its upcoming Pixel 10. The exchange underlines how several of iOS 26's innovations have been staples on Android devices for years.Samsung was the first to subtly mock iOS 26's redesigned user interface. Samsung shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that referenced the iPhone's new glass-like UI, stating, ""Customizable apps? Floating bars? That sleek glass UI? Looks… familiar"", subtly highlighting resemblances to Samsung's own previous One UI redesigns.Samsung also took a jab at Apple's new AI-powered Live Translation feature for Messages, FaceTime and Phone. Pointing out its own established presence in real-time translation, a feature launched last year with the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung's post declared, ""New to live translations? Welcome aboard! We’ve been translating text and speech in real-time for a while now.""Microsoft also mocked Apple's ""Liquid Glass"" interface for macOS Tahoe 26. Microsoft posted a montage of Windows Vista screenshots on its Instagram account, complete with nostalgic boot-up sounds from 2007.

Watch young Elon Musk pitch his space dream before SpaceX took off



The Economic Times

“E-L-O-N M-U-S-K”: From unknown engineer to global mogul

A rare look at the person behind the persona

In 2025, Elon Musk is a name most people recognise. He runs companies like SpaceX , Tesla , and X (formerly Twitter). His net worth is well over $400 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes. He’s often in the news whether for launching rockets, commenting on politics, or reshaping social media. But it wasn’t always this way.A resurfaced video from around 2002, now featured by The Economic Times (June 2025), shows Musk at a time when few knew who he was. In the short clip, Musk is seen introducing himself in a calm, straightforward tone. He says,He even explains what his company does, calling it “Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX.” This early footage shows a very different side of someone who would go on to become the richest person on the planet.The video captures Musk during the early days of SpaceX, the rocket company he founded in 2002. At the time, he had just sold PayPal and used $100 million of his own money to start the space venture. The clip, shared in, is a rare look into Musk’s early efforts to explain his mission and gain public interest in space exploration.Back then, SpaceX was a small, unknown startup. It had no major launches, no contracts with NASA, and no working rocket. Musk believed humans needed to become a “multi-planetary species,” and SpaceX was his bet on that future. In the clip, he talks about how using telescopes isn’t enough: ""You have to actually go there."" That simple belief would guide SpaceX through multiple failed launches before its first major success in 2008.The video may seem minor, but it captures a time before the fame. Musk wasn’t a household name. He was an entrepreneur introducing himself on camera because almost no one knew how to pronounce his name, let alone what his company did.That moment is now hard to imagine. As of 2025, Musk runs multiple high-profile ventures. SpaceX is regularly launching rockets to the International Space Station. Tesla leads in electric vehicle production. Neuralink is developing brain-machine interfaces. X (formerly Twitter) is being rebuilt into what Musk calls an “everything app.”He’s also behind xAI, an artificial intelligence company aiming to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. His influence extends into global politics, defense contracts, cryptocurrency, and infrastructure.What stands out in the 2002 clip is Musk’s tone—measured, even quiet. He didn’t talk about colonizing Mars or merging humans with AI. He just explained who he was and what his new company planned to do. It’s a rare reminder that even the most powerful people start out explaining themselves, sometimes letter by letter.The resurfacing of this video, shared widely on platforms like X and Reddit in June 2025, struck a chord online. Many users pointed out how far Musk has come from spelling out his name to influencing everything from global space policy to the direction of AI research.Others noted that the clip reflects how much of his early vision has remained unchanged. He still talks about space. He still speaks about building a future worth living in. But now, billions of dollars, hundreds of launches, and millions of followers later, far more people are listening.","A resurfaced video from around 2002, now featured by The Economic Times (June 2025), shows Musk at a time when few knew who he was.

OpenAI, the creator of the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, has expanded the capabilities of its experimental WhatsApp service, 1-800-ChatGPT, to include image generation. This new feature, likely powered by OpenAI 's DALL-E model , is now available to all users, making AI-generated visuals more accessible than ever through the popular messaging platform.“ChatGPT image generation is now available in WhatsApp via 1-800-ChatGPT,” the company said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“Now available to everyone. https://wa.me/18002428478,” it added.OpenAI emphasizes that linking a ChatGPT account to the 1-800-ChatGPT service on WhatsApp will provide users with more image generations.“Don't forget to link your ChatGPT account to 1-800-ChatGPT in WhatsApp to get more image generations,” OpenAI added.This move follows OpenAI's initial integration of its chatbot into WhatsApp last December, an initiative aimed at making ChatGPT more accessible without requiring users to download a dedicated app or create a separate account.To begin generating images via ChatGPT on WhatsApp, users simply need to save the number +1 (800) 242-8478 on their smartphone.Once saved, a conversation can be initiated by sending a simple ""Hi"" message on WhatsApp.The bot will then guide users through prompts to link their existing ChatGPT account, directing them to a secure login page.After linking, users can immediately begin generating images by providing text prompts, such as ""Create an image of a doberman running in a field of sunflowers during sunset."" The bot will respond with AI-generated images in a few moments.However, if you are unable to link a ChatGPT account with the WhatsApp chatbot, you can try again after some time because there is likely that the functionality is not yet operational on your phone, indicating that OpenAI may still be working on the full integration.","OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of its experimental WhatsApp service, 1-800-ChatGPT, to include image generation.
