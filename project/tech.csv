You can love Taylor Swift's music whilst criticising her actions and the systemic issues she perpetuates whole ALSO criticising this bs”Another user posted, “okay and? both aren’t any good. doesn’t matter who it is either way they’re both billionaires emitting a sh*t ton of harmful emissions. just because katy’s done so by a larger amount doesn’t mean taylor’s isn’t also still an insanely large amount.”A fifth fan noted, “reminder that we should get on all rich people for doing this!!”Taylor Swift taking her private jet for short trips, has constantly been criticised for a few years now, but the pop star has remained silent about it.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Miami, meanwhile, could benefit from Hield’s shooting if they retool their roster.Potential Trade Package- Warriors Receive: Bam Adebayo- Heat Receive: Buddy Hield, future draft picks, and/or young playersAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles predicted to acquire 6-foot-8 Brooklyn Nets forward to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic Although Golden State's urgency will depend on their postseason run, switching from Hield to Adebayo makes sense.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995. The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters. The gift came shortly after this week’s all-women Blue Origin space flight, which Sánchez helped organise alongside Bezos through his Blue Origin initiative.Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian traveled to Van Horn, Texas, earlier this week to support Lauren Sánchez as she took part in an all-female Blue Origin space flight.Jenner said about Sánchez.Khloé Kardashian also shared her thoughts, saying the family is proud of “all of the female astronauts,” referring to the rest of the crew that included: Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn.Ahead of her Blue Origin flight, Sánchez emphasized the importance of designing better-fitting spacesuits for women. Collaborating with designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, Sánchez helped develop a suit specifically designed for women, addressing a long-standing issue where space suits were originally made for men and later adapted.Her efforts align with Blue Origin’s focus on inclusive design and follow a 2019 incident where NASA cancelled an all-female spacewalk due to a lack of properly fitting suits.","Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian gave Lauren Sánchez a $6,995 handbag shaped like an UFO.

"‘Veeraswamy’, oldest Indian restaurant in Britain, under threat of closure as Crown Estate refuses to renew lease",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/veeraswamy-oldest-indian-restaurant-in-britain-under-threat-of-closure-as-crown-estate-refuses-to-renew-lease/articleshow/120288756.cms,"Veeraswamy Restaurant in London (Image Credit: X/@theveeraswamy)

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This Saturday, history was created in Beijing when twenty-one humanoid robots raced in the Yizhuang half-marathon . It was the first event where robots shared the stage with human runners in a 21-kilometre racetrack, a monumental leap in the development of robots and artificial intelligence. The competition attracted extensive coverage, showcasing advancements in humanoid robots and providing glimpses of future applications in other industries.The robots that participated were made by different Chinese robot makers, including well-known firms like DroidVP and Noetix Robotics. The robots varied in size and shape, offering a great range of designs for the public to view. Some of the robots stood at just 1.2 meters, while others reached a height of 1.8 meters. This difference in height and build illustrates the versatility of humanoid robots, indicating that there is no one formula for designing robots.Certain manufacturers advanced their design of robots a notch higher in terms of more human-like features. For example, one such manufacturer had a robot with a female face that was able to mimic similar human facial expressions such as smiling and winking. Customization for the robots also did not limit itself to looks since many also spent weeks preparing their robots in an attempt to give them flawless performance in the race.The race was not merely a race but also an exhibition of the technical and engineering advancement in the field of robotics. Beijing officials described the race as a motor race, referencing the pivotal role that was played by the engineering teams and navigation experts who piloted the robots through the competition. As a high-performance racing team is attached to each robot, there was a technical team attached to each robot that could manage its technical aspect so that the robot performed uniformly throughout the race.Witnesses were able to witness the sophistication and precision it requires for the robots to master the challenging 21kilometers route. He Sishu, an observer who works in the artificial intelligence field, commented, ""The robots are running well, very stable… I feel I am seeing the upgrading of robots and AI."" This was a reflection on the general mood and perspective that this was a turning point for the advancement of humanoid robots and AI technology.Even though the robots were meant to run on their own, the majority of them continued to require trainers for support. Some of therobots required physical assistance, particularly when there was a technical issue, and the trainers had to intervene to help them stay on track. In some cases, trainers physically supported the robots in order to avoid them falling behind or getting stranded during the competition.Both in appearance and in gear, some of the robots had sneakers on their arms, others distinct accessories that continued to make them look better aesthetically. Some of the robots even sported boxing gloves, indicating a ""fighting attitude,"" another a red strap worn on the head with phrases printed on it, ""Bound to Win,"" which was Chinese as well. These lighthearted additions gave the robots character and showed how companies were trying to make the robots more human-like in order to appeal more powerfully to individuals. The Winner: Tiangong UltraTiangong Ultra, a robot that was built and designed by the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, took part in the marathon. Tiangong Ultra won the race by coming in first to complete the 21kilometers within a mind-boggling 2 hours and 40 minutes. This is an extraordinary feat for a humanoid robot. Nonetheless, the human marathon champion took the race to completion in 1 hour and 2 minutes, which only further illustrated the disparity between robots and humans as far as running long distances is concerned.The Beijing Human Robotics Innovation Centre is a joint venture, with two state-owned companies owning 43% of its shares, and the robotics arm of tech titan Xiaomi and leader in humanoid robotics UBTech owning the remaining shares. The center's participation in this event is also an indication that China is investing heavily in robotics and aims to be a leader in the industry.Tiangong Ultra's victory can be attributed to several factors, such as its superior design and superior technology. Tang Jian, the chief technology officer at Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, attributes Tiangong Ultra's long legs as a key factor in its superb performance during the competition. Additionally, the robot possessed an advanced algorithm that allowed it to mimic the way humans run a marathon, enhancing its performance along the distance.Tang claimed, ""I don't boast but no other robot companies in the West have matched Tiangong's success on the sporting field."" He also explained that the batteries in the robot had to be changed three times while competing to ensure that it functioned for the entire 21kilometers.Despite the triumph, not every robot performed well. Some had mechanical issues from the start. One robot, for example, broke down at the start line and had to remain lying there for a number of minutes before it was able to start running again. Another robot had a crash early on in the event, which crashed into a railing and caused its human operator to lose balance and fall over. These problems were indicative of the teething issues that humanoid robots face as they are forced to operate in real-world environments. While the robots were impressive, it was clear that a lot of work was required to enhance reliability and performance under unpredictable conditions.","Twenty-one humanoid robots raced in the Yizhuang half-marathon.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Travis Kelce’s influence: Is he reshaping Taylor Swift’s inner circle?



In recent weeks, fans and media alike have speculated about Taylor Swift ’s noticeably cooled relationship with long-time friend Blake Lively , particularly during the ongoing legal battle involving Blake and actor Justin Baldoni . As the lawsuit unfolds, whispers have emerged questioning whether Swift’s romantic partner, NFL star Travis Kelce , may have played a role in the growing distance between the once-tight duo.Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have been close for years, often seen vacationing together, attending events, and celebrating birthdays. Their bond extended to family moments, with Swift often sharing sweet interactions with Lively’s children.

Kelce’s charismatic, outspoken persona has made headlines, and some insiders suggest he may be playing a bigger role in Swift’s social decisions than previously thought. Could Kelce have encouraged Swift to maintain distance during Blake’s lawsuit to avoid negative press or distractions?While there’s no public statement from either party confirming this, sources close to Swift hint at her increasing focus on maintaining a drama-free environment as she prepares for upcoming music releases and tour dates. Kelce, known for his protective nature, may have simply been looking out for Swift’s best interests.Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s lawsuit has drawn significant media attention, with fans dissecting every detail.

How to tame Cats in Minecraft



How to Tame a CAT Easily in Minecraft - TUTORIAL

Crouch or sneak as you are going slower to the cat. You must do this so that they don’t run away.

As the next step, you must hold the raw fish in your hand and wait for the cat to come closer to you.

After the cat gets close enough, you must right-click to feed it.

Upon repeating the feeding process several times, you will find heart symbols on top of the cat. This indicates that you have successfully tamed a cat.

Breeding Cats



There are several passive mobs in Minecraft, one of the most adorable ones being cats. They are wonderful companions to have in your journey, and they also serve a useful purpose of keeping creepers and phantoms away.These agile animals are generally seen roaming freely in places like villages. To make them follow you, the cats have to be tamed. If you want to know the exact details about taming a cat in Minecraft, you can follow the simple step-by-step guide that has been provided below.To start with the process of taming cats in Minecraft , you will have to locate one. Essentially, the particular mob spawns in villages that have at least one villager and one bed. The more beds you find in a village, the higher the chance you have of finding cats. Besides this, you can also end up finding black cats inside swamp huts, which spawn with witches.As specified above, cats roam freely and are pretty agile.
