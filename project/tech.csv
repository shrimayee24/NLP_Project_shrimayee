"Isro attempts & succeeds in 'rolling' SpaDeX satellites, learning key for future docking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-attempts-succeeds-in-rolling-spadex-satellites-learning-key-for-future-docking/articleshow/119613052.cms,"What was done

Why it’s important

BENGALURU: Isro, which recently undocked the two satellites part of its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission on March 13, has successfully completed another experiment — the “rolling” or “rotating” experiment — which involved circumnavigation of one of the satellites and bringing it back to the same spot.This experiment, being likened to the Chandrayaan-3 “hop” experiment the space agency conducted on Moon in terms of learning it provides for future missions, would help Isro validate multiple softwares, ground station control and more.Isro chairman V Narayanan confirmed to TOI that the experiment was carried out last week, and said: “We’ve completed the rolling experiment. The satellites have a lot of propellant… I have only told [the teams] one thing, please do everything [on] simulation on ground [first]. Let us be very careful. Let us not make any mistakes as a wealth of data can be generated [through various experiments].So, what exactly did Isro do? Imagine you and your friend outside a coffee shop on Church Street (Bengaluru).After a long hug (docking), your friend has taken a few steps away (undocking) from you while still in your line of sight. Now, your friend either does a somersault or runs around making a circle, returning to her/his original position. That’s what happened with the satellite in the latest experiment.During the whole time, the satellite performing the experiment was in the line of vision of the other satellite. The experiment was to help Isro validate its control over satellite manoeuvring from ground — that means a slew of softwares, sensors, positioning tech etc. There is no immediate confirmation if the satellite did the circumnavigation (do the full circle) horizontally or vertically (somersault).As reported by TOI earlier, Isro’s first docking on Jan 16, was only the first step towards Isro mastering this technology that is critical for several future missions, including the Chandrayaan-4 sample return mission to the Moon and human spaceflight missions part of the extended Gaganyaan programme Isro will need to dock in various conditions, some of which will be attempted as part of the current mission. Isro will conduct more docking as part of SpaDeX. “The next slot is only next month. We are planning many things,” Narayanan said.Last week’s experiment will help Isro understand what it takes to bring an object to a desired spot from different orientations for docking. It will also help Isro learn whether docking could be done vertically and so on.With a lot of fuel left in the satellite, Isro is expected to carry out more experiments. Afterall, SpaDex is an experimental mission and Isro is hoping to make the most of it. Also, once the next docking is complete, there will be another attempt to do power transfer between the satellites, learning from which — some lessons have already been learnt from the first attempt — will be crucial for future mission design and development.",Isro chairman V Narayanan confirmed to TOI that the experiment was carried out last week.

Shaunie Henderson and her husband Pastor Keion Henderson explain their successful marriage



Shaquille O'Neal ’s ex, Shaunie Henderson is happily married to Pastor Keion Henderson . The couple, who lead Houston’s Lighthouse Church and Ministries, have built a strong foundation by prioritizing their relationship amidst their busy lives. In a recent chat with Madame Noire, Shaunie, and Keion shared intricate details of their marriage and how they keep their relationship afloat with certain key pointers.As Pastor Keion Henderson explains, managing multiple responsibilities is essential. “We all have to manage multiple things,” he told Madame Noire. “You must manage yourself; if you have a significant other, you must manage that... Everybody has to be multi-faceted.”Outside influences don’t define their marriage. “We recognize that the Internet is not our relationship. The church is not our relationship. People’s opinions, they are not our relationship. We met each other. We chose this journey together and did what we had to stay on the original ship. We don’t let water in the ship,” Keion explains, adding that constant communication and grace are key to their success. Shaunie Henderson values advice from a trusted mentor who told her, “One of the things that I hold dear is that she says not to meet anyone’s expectations. Because once you meet one, there’ll be another one, and there’ll be another one after that, and you will never meet it and just be disappointing yourself and performing.”Defining marriage on their terms is crucial to the Hendersons. “Just because I’m a pastor and just because she’s a First Lady, that doesn’t mean that your faith isn’t tested,” Keion shares. “My definition of marriage is the collision of two histories… And sometimes compatibility isn’t the outcome.” They believe that open communication is essential. “We try to have a designated day that we sit down and talk, but with our life, travel, and schedule, that day and time can change,” Shaunie added.Knowing when to step away is another lesson they’ve learned in their marriage. “Our approach has been twofold. No. 1, communicate. No. 2, step away,” Keion reveals. “We’ll give each other some time to think about it and then come and talk.” Keion, author of Lazy Love: Recognizing and Reversing the 4 Threats to Any Successful Relationship, explains, “As I understand you, you understand me. I trust the outcomes that we both come away with… We always come together stronger than ever.”Faith remains the core of their union. “It is a must,” Shaunie asserts. “As women, we need to feel safe, and once you feel safe, you’re OK with being vulnerable… Having a spiritual component in your marriage is another layer of safety.” Keion adds that faith offers reassurance, saying, “I want folks to feel like they are overcomers… that they can manage their children and their businesses and their relationships.”Also Read: ""It's less physical"": Shaquille O'Neal weighs in on LeBron James' career amid injury controversy Shaunie was previously married to NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal.

With ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest GPT-4o update sparking a viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style portraits , social media is buzzing with ethereal, anime-inspired images. However, this feature, rolled out on Tuesday, March 25, is currently limited to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Select subscription tiers, leaving free-tier users out of the fun—at least for now. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced Wednesday that overwhelming demand has delayed the feature's rollout to free users, meaning those on the basic plan can't tap into the native image-generation capabilities of GPT-4o or Sora. But don't worry: you don't need ChatGPT Plus to join the Ghibli fest.AI models like Gemini or Grok can also create Studio Ghibli-style visuals—think lush greenery, soft lighting, and expressive characters—provided you're precise with your prompts, such as ""a serene Ghibli-style girl with flowing hair under a cherry blossom tree.""However, the output might differ from ChatGPT's GPT-4o creations, as each model interprets styles uniquely due to differences in training data and algorithms. While ChatGPT's images lean toward photorealistic finesse, Gemini, Grok, or trial-based platforms might produce a slightly more abstract or varied take on Ghibli's charm, requiring some experimentation to nail the vibe.You can still transform your photos or ideas into Studio Ghibli-inspired art without a ChatGPT subscription. Free platforms like Craiyon, DeepAI, and Playground AI offer AI image generation with varying levels of customization. Simply upload a photo or type a prompt like ""portrait in Studio Ghibli style, lush forest background, soft colors,"" and let the AI work its magic.Again, these tools may not match GPT-4o's photorealistic precision, but they can mimic Ghibli's whimsical aesthetic—think flowing hair, vibrant landscapes, and gentle expressions. For better control, try Artbreeder, which lets you blend images and tweak styles, though some features require a paid upgrade.If you're aiming for higher quality, platforms like Runway ML, Leonardo AI, or Mage.space offer free trials that rival ChatGPT's capabilities. Sign up, upload your image, and use prompts to emulate Ghibli's signature look—dreamy lighting, hand-drawn textures, and nature-infused scenes. These tools often provide more advanced editing options, letting you refine details like Totoro-esque fluffiness or Spirited Away-inspired hues.While ChatGPT Plus users revel in OpenAI's loosened style restrictions, these workarounds prove you don't need a subscription to create Ghibli magic. Experiment, share your results, and join the trend—subscription or not.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest GPT-4o update sparked a viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style portraits.

Watch the viral clip here:

A recent wave of AI-generated images in Studio Ghibli style has taken over social media, with thousands of users generating whimsical and painterly visuals using OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also joined the trend by updating his profile picture to an AI-generated Ghibli-style avatar. As the AI-driven trend gained momentum, an old video of Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki resurfaced online. In the clip, Miyazaki criticizes AI-generated animation , calling it “an insult to life itself.”The video, originally recorded during a meeting at Studio Ghibli, features Miyazaki reacting to an AI-generated animation presented to him and producer Toshio Suzuki . The animation depicted a zombie-like figure moving in an unnatural way. The AI development team presenting the clip explained that artificial intelligence could create movements that would not be possible for humans to conceive.One of the presenters explained (translated from Japanese), ""It looks like it's dancing. It's moving by using its head. It doesn't feel any pain and has no concept of protecting its head. It uses its head like a leg. This movement is so creepy and could be applied to a zombie video game. Artificial intelligence could present us with grotesque movements that we humans can't imagine.""Miyazaki did not share their enthusiasm. Instead of praising the AI's capabilities, he reacted with visible discomfort.He compared the AI-generated movements to the struggles of a disabled friend, saying, ""I can't watch this stuff and find [it] interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is whatsoever. I am utterly disgusted. If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it. I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.""He concluded with the statement: ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.""Following Miyazaki’s response, one of the AI developers defended their experiment, stating, ""This is just our experiment and we don't intend to do anything by showing it to the world."" Suzuki, the producer, also questioned the team about their ultimate goal. The developers explained that their aim was to build a machine capable of drawing pictures like humans.","An old video of Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has resurfaced online.

Skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts are in for a spectacular celestial event as a partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025. This breathtaking phenomenon will follow a total lunar eclipse that took place just weeks earlier, adding to the excitement for stargazers. The eclipse will be particularly visible across parts of the northeastern United States and Canada, where observers will witness the moon partially obscuring the sun at sunrise, creating a stunning crescent-like effect.Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon completely blocks the sun, a partial eclipse leaves a portion of the sun visible, offering a unique viewing experience. This event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. With proper precautions and the right viewing locations, this solar eclipse promises to be a memorable spectacle.According to Space.com, the March 29, 2025, solar eclipse will occur between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The event will be best visible at sunrise across several states in the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada.The following states will have some of the best views of the partial solar eclipse, as reported by USA Today:Additionally, the eclipse will be visible across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. However, visibility will depend on local weather conditions, so clear skies will be essential for an optimal viewing experience.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, but its alignment is not perfect, causing only a portion of the sun to be obscured. The extent to which the sun is covered depends on the observer's location. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.Although partial eclipses do not create the dramatic darkness of a total eclipse, they remain fascinating astronomical events. Observers will notice shadows appearing sharper, temperature drops, and changes in animal behavior during the peak of the eclipse.The March 29, 2025, eclipse is part of a series of solar eclipses that occur as the Earth, moon, and sun align at specific intervals. The moon’s orbital tilt prevents solar eclipses from occurring every month, making them relatively rare events.During a partial solar eclipse, the sun is never fully covered, and the extent of the obscuration depends on the observer's position on Earth. The phenomenon is a reminder of the intricate mechanics of celestial bodies and their predictable yet mesmerizing movements.At sunrise, when the eclipse reaches its peak in North America, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, giving the impression that a large portion of it has been ""bitten off."" As the moon moves along its orbit, the sun will gradually regain its full shape, marking the end of the event.Unlike lunar eclipses, which are safe to view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require special protective measures. Looking directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse, can cause severe retinal damage, often referred to as ""eclipse blindness.""To safely observe the eclipse, experts recommend using:Standard sunglasses are not sufficient for protection and should not be used. Organizations such as NASA and the American Astronomical Society provide guidelines on purchasing certified eclipse glasses to ensure safe viewing.The partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). It will be best visible at sunrise across the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Some of the key locations for optimal viewing include New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia, among others.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun but does not fully cover it. This results in a portion of the sun remaining visible, creating a crescent-like effect. In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely obscures the sun, briefly turning day into night.Viewing a solar eclipse requires proper eye protection. Experts recommend using eclipse glasses that meet ISO 12312-2 safety standards, solar viewing filters, or indirect viewing methods such as pinhole projectors. Standard sunglasses are not safe for eclipse viewing, as they do not provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays.Solar eclipses are rare because the moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon, Earth, and sun do not always align perfectly. Eclipses only occur when their orbits intersect at specific points, leading to either partial or total solar eclipses.Yes, during the peak of the eclipse, observers may notice subtle environmental changes such as a slight drop in temperature, sharper shadows, and altered animal behavior. These effects occur because the reduced sunlight affects both the atmosphere and the natural world.","A partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025.

The Mirror We Love



The Illusion of Becoming



The Ethical Question



Reality Reasserts Itself



What does Donald Trump being shot at have in common with Shah Rukh Khan spreading his arms wide in a mustard field? What unites a lone protester at Tiananmen Square and a wedding in Kolkata? They have all been turned into Ghibli portraits—at least for a moment.Yes, that Ghibli. The hand-drawn dreamscape of Hayao Miyazaki . The soft-lit realm of spirits, forests, flying castles, and girls with wind-tousled hair—now transposed onto our memories and icons, courtesy of artificial intelligence. A new filter that harks back to the cartoons we grew up with, as social media user @Gabbbar pointed out. But is it something more?InJean-Paul Sartre argued that human existence is not defined by what we are, but by what we project ourselves toward. We are not fixed beings—we are always becoming, shaping our identities through imagined futures, chosen selves, and ideal versions of who we might be. In this sense, every Ghibli-style portrait is more than stylised nostalgia; it’s existential projection—a quiet act of longing. AI does not merely render an image; it renders a desire—like what we might see in the Mirror of Erised from the Harry Potter universe, which shows our deepest wants.Protest, romance, childhood, catastrophe—all reimagined in the palette of, andNot painted by human hands, but summoned by code—each frame a whispered wish for the world to have been gentler, softer, more beautiful than it was.With OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT update, the Ghiblification of memory began—and ended, just as abruptly.On March 26, 2025, OpenAI rolled out one of the most emotionally resonant updates in recent memory. ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4o, briefly allowed paid users to generate and edit images natively. Upload a selfie, a wedding photo, a political moment—and the model, built on DALL·E 3, reimagines it in a painterly, melancholic style unmistakably Ghibli-esque.Shah Rukh Khan’s outstretched arms become a frame from a Japanese love story. A scene of violence becomes strangely tender. Even war zones take on the quiet sorrow of a Miyazaki landscape.OpenAI’s model may not say “Ghibli” aloud—but it doesn’t have to.There’s something extraordinary about the speed with which this trend spread. It wasn’t just selfies being transformed—it was history. Moments once captured through the harsh clarity of journalism were suddenly stylised into soft, glowing pastels where even suffering seemed to pause and exhale.Studio Ghibli’s aesthetic has never been about fantasy in the Western sense. It’s about intimacy. Founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki , the studio’s films brought a radical softness to the screen. They showed us that wonder exists in quietness, that beauty hides in overlooked places—a bowl of ramen, a walk to school, a forest spirit watching silently.That aesthetic has returned—this time through artificial intelligence—as a kind of cultural balm. And people responded in kind.Part of the enchantment lies in what these Ghibli-style portraits gently erase. Hair appears fuller, skin smoother, eyes brighter. The small imperfections that define us are softened or omitted entirely. Our faces are lit in warm hues and golden light. We don’t just look better—we look loved.In a society obsessed with harsh clarity, these portraits offer a version of ourselves that feels timeless and quietly transcendent. Not necessarily perfect, but poetic.It’s like seeing your reflection in the Mirror of Erised—not as you are, but as you hope to be.But beauty, when too easily granted, can also lull us into forgetting the responsibility that comes with being real.Jean-Paul Sartre taught that we are not what happens to us—we are what we do with what happens to us. We are condemned to be free. And there is no freedom in looking at idealised versions of ourselves, over and over again.To project ourselves into better light is not inherently false—but it becomes dangerous when we begin to believe in those images more than in the difficult, often unglamorous work of becoming.That’s where the Ghibli-style images, for all their charm and warmth, quietly betray us.They give us the illusion of transformation without requiring action. They offer beauty without process, intimacy without vulnerability, nostalgia without memory. They turn projection—a necessary part of growth—into a screen we hide behind.Sartre warned that when we use projection to escape rather than engage, we fall into bad faith—a denial of our freedom, a refusal to take ownership of the self we are constantly creating. In that sense, these AI-crafted dreams, however lovely, risk becoming a form of self-deception.The Ghibli-style image is both a gift and a mirror. It reflects not what we are—but what we wish the world would make of us. Whether that is art or artifice, memory or fantasy depends on whether we still choose to live in the reality that lies just beyond the frame.Because in the end, the most beautiful image is not the one that flatters us—but the one we are still free to change.Then there’s the ethical issue. Critics have accused the trend of aestheticising pain, trivialising culture, and flattening an artistic tradition that was never meant to be a filter. In fact, it’s arguably an intellectual property violation—borrowing years of painstaking craftsmanship without permission or compensation.As illustrator Robbie Shilstone wrote on X: “Miyazaki spent his entire life building one of the most expansive and imaginative bodies of work, all so you could rip it off and use it as a filter for your vacation photos. Not into this one bit. Protect artists.”He added: “I can't think of a worse artist to do it to. He is notorious for his attention to detail, his painstaking revisions, his uncompromising dedication to his craft. Now it's just viewed as content... it's a real shame.”Ghibli is not just a style. It is the result of decades of devotion, slowness, and care. To distil it into a look, reproduced in seconds, feels to many like a betrayal of what the studio stands for.Even Hayao Miyazaki himself was vocally disgusted by the concept of AI-generated animation. When shown a prototype of AI-generated movement in 2023, he called it “an insult to life itself.”Legally, there’s little recourse. Ghibli’s characters and trademarks are protected, but its tone, colour palette, and emotional cadence are not. A machine can copy the look, even if it can’t understand the soul behind it. After all, ChatGPT itself was ostensibly trained on the work of countless creators. But for those who believe art is sacred, that distinction still matters.As quickly as the Ghibli wave arrived, it began to recede. The latest message now reads: “I couldn’t generate the Ghibli-style image from your latest upload due to content policy restrictions around generating images based on real individuals.” Of course, this could simply be a feature of an overload and there are other options that c an be used to create these images. The restriction seems to be OpenAI’s response to the sheer volume of uploads involving real people—celebrities, political figures, loved ones. As AI-generated likenesses of public and private lives flooded social media, OpenAI likely reinforced its content policy prohibiting visual recreations of identifiable individuals without consent.Though stylised and abstract, these portraits tread dangerously close to real likeness. The restriction isn’t just a technical adjustment—it’s a reminder: even dreams drawn in pastel must reckon with the rules of reality. Freedom, after all, is what we do with what’s been done to us. For a brief moment, that meant reimagining ourselves as Ghibli. But like all things, that too must pass.","OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT update, the Ghiblification of memory began—and ended, just as abruptly.

The personal information, like mobile numbers, email addresses, and certain passwords of senior US President Donald Trump 's security advisers, is accessible on the internet, according to a Wednesday report by German news magazine Der Spiegel.After the Signal chat controversy, this is another case of sensitive information being leaked from the Trump administration.The publication revealed that sensitive details, including mobile numbers, email addresses and certain passwords belonging to national security advisor Mike Waltz , director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and defence secretary Pete Hegseth , are found through commercial data-search platforms and leaked online databases.These contact details, which remain largely current, were associated with various digital platforms including Instagram, LinkedIn, Dropbox and location-tracking applications.The report indicated that Gabbard and Waltz's contact information was connected to their WhatsApp and Signal messaging accounts.According to the German publication, most of these numbers and email addresses are still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn.And these data were were used to create Dropbox accounts and profiles in apps that track running data. There are also WhatsApp profiles for the respective phone numbers and even Signal accounts in some cases.Spiegel found some of the contact information for Gabbard, Hegseth and Waltz in commercial databases, while other information was in so-called password leaks, which are hardly a rarity on the internet.The German media outlet found it relatively straightforward to obtain Hegseth's contact details. They utilised a commercial database service, typically employed by businesses for sales and recruitment purposes.By submitting Hegseth's LinkedIn profile link to the database provider, they received his Gmail address, mobile number and additional information. Further investigation of data breaches showed his email address and password appeared in more than 20 public leaks. They confirmed the email address remained active through publicly accessible information.Director of National Intelligence Gabbard demonstrated greater digital security awareness compared to her two colleagues. Whilst she managed to restrict her information on commercial contact databases used to find Hegseth and Waltz, her email address appeared on both WikiLeaks and Reddit platforms.Records indicated Gabbard's email address featured in over 10 data breaches. One breach contained a partial phone number that, once completed, connected to active WhatsApp and Signal accounts.""Exposed data from top politicians can be used by hackers to launch convincing phishing attacks and gain access to devices and various services such as email, chat tools and PayPal,"" says Donald Ortmann, a specialist in information security, information procurement and social engineering.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
