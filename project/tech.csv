Mason Rudolph rejoins Steelers on two-year deal



BREAKING: STEELERS BRING BACK MASON RUDOLPH

Why Mason Rudolph’s return matter for Pittsburgh?

The Pittsburgh Steelers are making moves ahead of the 2025 season, and one of their latest decisions brings back a familiar name to their quarterback lineup. As the team looks to solidify its depth under center, reports confirm that a former Steelers signal-caller is set to return to the black and gold.In a move that has caught the attention of fans and analysts alike, quarterback Mason Rudolph is officially making his way back to Pittsburgh. According to ESPN, the veteran quarterback has agreed to a two-year contract worth $8 million, with $4.5 million guaranteed.Rudolph, who previously spent several seasons with the Steelers, was a reliable backup and occasional starter during his first stint with the team. Last season, he explored his options in free agency and had interest from multiple teams, including the Tennessee Titans. However, after considering his opportunities, he ultimately decided to reunite with the Steelers.Also Read: Buccaneers sign ex-Lions CB Kindle Vildor in new deal The return of Mason Rudolph provides Pittsburgh with stability at the quarterback position, particularly as the team looks to navigate the challenges of the upcoming season. Having spent years learning the Steelers' system, he brings familiarity and experience that could prove invaluable in a supporting role or in the event of an unexpected shake-up at the position.While Mason Rudolph’s past performances in Pittsburgh had their ups and downs, his experience and understanding of the franchise make him a logical fit. With the Steelers aiming to build a strong roster for the 2025 campaign, bringing back a quarterback who knows the system inside and out could be a strategic move in ensuring depth and reliability at the position.As the new season approaches, all eyes will be on how Mason Rudolph integrates back into the team’s plans. Whether as a backup or a potential starter, his presence ensures that the Steelers have an experienced option in place should the need arise. The return of a familiar face under center might just be what Pittsburgh needs to stay competitive in a demanding AFC landscape.","Mason Rudolph has agreed to a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to reports.

Total lunar eclipse in the US: Timings and how to watch

What not to do during Blood Moon and Total Lunar Eclipse

Don’t Expect Instant Color Changes – The Moon won’t turn red all at once. The shift happens gradually as Earth's shadow covers it, so be patient.

Avoid Bright Lights – Streetlights, phone screens, and indoor lighting can make it harder to see the eclipse clearly. Try watching from a dark location for the best view.

Don’t Use Solar Eclipse Glasses – Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye. You don’t need any protective eyewear.

Don’t Rely Only on the Naked Eye – While you can see the eclipse without equipment, using binoculars or a telescope will enhance the experience by revealing more details.

Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute – Lunar eclipses last for hours, but the total eclipse phase is shorter. Know the exact timing so you don’t miss the Blood Moon at its peak.



Next lunar eclipse in 2025

A total lunar eclipse is set to light up the night sky late Thursday and early Friday, giving skywatchers a rare chance to witness a Blood Moon . This is the only lunar eclipse visible from the US this year and the first total lunar eclipse since November 2022. The entire event will last around six hours, with the best views expected across North and South America, though it will be visible throughout the Western Hemisphere.A total lunar eclipse happens when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align, causing the Moon to pass through Earth's darkest shadow. During this, the Moon takes on a reddish or copper hue, earning the name Blood Moon. This color change happens because sunlight filters through Earth's atmosphere, projecting the colors of sunrises and sunsets onto the Moon.The eclipse begins with a penumbral phase at 11:57 PM EDT (8:57 PM PDT) Thursday. The partial eclipse starts at 1:09 AM EDT (10:09 PM PDT) Friday, making it look like a ""bite"" is taken out of the Moon. The most dramatic phase, totality, occurs at 2:26 AM EDT (11:26 PM PDT) Friday, when the Moon will glow red. Totality ends at 3:31 AM EDT (12:31 AM PDT), and the eclipse fully concludes by sunrise.Unlike a solar eclipse, this event doesn’t require special glasses—just step outside and look up. A dark location away from city lights will offer the best view, and using binoculars or a telescope can enhance the experience. If the weather isn’t ideal, websites like Timeanddate.com will livestream the event starting at 1 AM EDT Friday.This month's full Moon, called the Worm Moon, will reach peak illumination at 2:55 AM EDT Friday and will appear full for three nights. The name comes from the Maine Farmers' Almanac, which documented Native American names for full moons in the 1930s.The next total lunar eclipse will happen on September 7, 2025, visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The U.S. won’t see another total lunar eclipse until March 3, 2026.Looking ahead, the next solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, as a partial eclipse visible from multiple continents, followed by another on September 21, 2025.","A total lunar eclipse is set to light up the night sky late Thursday and early Friday, giving skywatchers a rare chance to witness a Blood Moon.

Did it take off without a wheel?

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen? Although unlikely, investigators are leaving no stone unturned.One thing’s for sure—this flight gave ""landing on your last leg"" a whole new meaning!","Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore.

Trump's 'DEATH STARE' At Reporter Caught On Camera | US Prez Microphone Moment Goes Viral

A brief but unusual moment involving US President Donald Trump and a reporter has gone viral after a video clip captured an accidental microphone mishap. The clip, shared by BNO News Live on social media, shows Trump listening intently to a question about Gaza when a microphone suddenly bumped into his face. His reaction—raising an eyebrow and giving the reporter a sharp look—quickly caught the internet’s attention.The incident took place while Trump was surrounded by reporters, answering questions. As one journalist asked about Gaza, another person’s microphone unexpectedly touched Trump’s face. While the contact appeared accidental, reactions online were divided.Some X users speculated whether it was intentional. “That looked deliberate to me unless the person can prove they tripped. It also shows how easily Trump can be assaulted. As a minimum, the Secret Service needs to have a full report on it. Safety first!” one person tweeted. Others dismissed it as typical media behaviour, with one user writing, “Classic media, always desperate to get in Trump’s space. He handles it like a champ every time!”Donald Trump also has long had a contentious relationship with the media, often branding journalists as the ""enemy of the people"" and dismissing some coverage as ""fake news."" During his presidency, his administration repeatedly clashed with reporters, from barring certain journalists including the Associated Press from covering White House events to revoking press credentials.","A video clip captured an accidental microphone mishap involving US President Donald Trump and a reporter.

NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 Mission: Liftoff from NASA's Kennedy Space Center! - Second Attempt

The first stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket has successfully completed its descent as its booster made a precise landing at the company’s Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This marks another milestone in SpaceX’s reusable rocket program, following the launch of the Crew-10 mission .The space agency had launched a fresh crew to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday night. The mission is key to the much awaited return of stranded Nasa astronauts Sunita ""Suni"" Williams and Butch Wilmore back to Earth after spending nine months on the International Space Station (ISS).Earlier, the crew access arm retracted, and the Dragon spacecraft’s launch escape system was momentarily armed. This system ensured that the Crew-10 astronauts can escape safely in case of an anomaly from liftoff until they reach orbit.The rocket passed through Max-Q, the point of highest pressure, before its first and second stages separated. The first stage then returned to Earth, landing smoothly at SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1, as per space agency Nasa.The new crew has been sent to replace Wilmore and Williams, who have spent more time on the ISS than originally planned. Their replacements are expected to arrive late on Saturday.The new team Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov—blasted off from Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX capsule as part of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program.The overlap will allow the astronauts to hand over duties before Wilmore and Williams return home.Wilmore and Williams were originally launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner capsule last June for a short test mission. However, technical issues like helium leaks and thruster failures, forced Nasa to delay their return, eventually deciding to bring them back on a SpaceX mission. Their return was further postponed due to battery repairs on a new SpaceX capsule, prompting the agency to use a refurbished one to speed up the process.The duo is expected to undock next week and splash down off the Florida coast, depending on the weather circumstances.","The first stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket has successfully completed its descent as its booster made a precise landing at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘more proud of a…’ than ChatGPT maker’s team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-more-proud-of-a-than-chatgpt-makers-team/articleshow/118749816.cms,"Sam Altman gives update on GPT-4.5

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.
