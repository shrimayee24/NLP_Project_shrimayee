Vande Bharat Sleeper: Top Features

Vande Bharat sleeper prototype will have 16 coaches, including 11 AC 3 tier coaches, 4 AC 2 tier coaches, and one AC 1st coach.

The total berth capacity of the train will be 823 passengers, with 611 in AC 3 tier, 188 in AC 2 tier, and 24 in AC 1st.

The berths will have extra cushioning, better than Rajdhani Express trains. The side of each berth will be well-cushioned to ensure a comfortable travel experience.

The interior of the new Vande Bharat sleeper will feature a soothing color scheme, with shades of cream, yellow, and wood creating a pleasant ambiance.

Passengers will find it easier to access the upper and middle berths, thanks to a better-designed ladder.

Sensor-based lighting will be installed in common areas, while energy-efficient overhead lighting will provide adequate illumination.

The aisle areas will have strips on the floor to facilitate easier movement during the night.

Vande Bharat sleeper will have sensor-based inter communication doors, noise insulation and mitigation measures for silent saloon space, special berths and toilets for differently abled, automatic entry/exit passenger doors

To ensure a smooth and comfortable ride, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will use semi-permanent couplers, similar to those used in the existing Vande Bharat chair car trains. This technology will minimize jerks and provide a more pleasant travel experience for passengers.

The Vande Bharat sleeper train will feature fully sealed gangways, allowing for easy movement between coaches. Passengers can expect a well-regulated air-conditioning system that maintains a comfortable temperature and a dust-free environment, much like the Vande Bharat chair car trains.

The exterior design of the Vande Bharat sleeper train will be inspired by the ""prowess of eagles"", incorporating sleek lines and a ""fierce aura"".

As a semi-high-speed offering, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will be capable of reaching speeds of up to 160 kmph, with the prototype being tested at even higher speeds of up to 180 kmph.

Vande Metro: Top Features

Vande Metro is a self-propelled train set, similar to the Vande Bharat Express, which means it does not require a locomotive to pull it. The main goal behind the development of the Vande Metro is to replace Mainline EMU trains and provide passengers with quicker and more comfortable travel option.

Vande Metro trains will utilize rapid acceleration and deceleration technology to reach a top operational speed of 130 kmph, which is much higher than the speed of current Mainline EMUs.

The Vande Metro trains will be fitted with contemporary designed lightweight cushioned seats, accommodating 100 seated passengers per coach, with additional standing room for 200 individuals. The lightweight car body will contribute to the train's overall efficiency and performance.

To begin with Vande Metro trains will have fully air-conditioned coaches. The Vande Metro trains will be equipped with modern amenities to ensure a comfortable and efficient journey for passengers seeking a premium short-distance travel experience.

The trains will also feature fully sealed gangways, allowing for easier movement between coaches and a dust-free environment, similar to the Vande Bharat Express.

Vande Metro will have lightweight aluminium luggage racks and Passenger Information Systems with LCD displays. Passengers will enjoy automatic entry and exit doors, mobile charging sockets, diffused lighting, route indicator displays, and wider panoramic sealed windows with roller blinds.

From a safety aspect, Vande Metro trains will come equipped with the KAVACH train anti-collision system, CCTV cameras, emergency talk-back units and automatic fire detection and alarm systems. The trains will also have modular toilets with bio-vacuum systems.

The number of coaches in each Vande Metro train will be either 12 or 16, depending on the demand of the specific route. According to a TOI report, railway officials have indicated that Vande Metro trains are expected to operate on various routes, including Agra-Mathura, Delhi-Rewari, Lucknow-Kanpur, Tirupati-Chennai, and Bhubaneswar-Balasore.

In February 2023, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw first announced the Vande Metro. Currently, two prototypes are being built at RCF Kapurthala and ICF Chennai. These prototypes will now undergo extensive testing.

Vande Bharat sleeper , Vande Metro update: Indian Railways is all set to roll out two new trains for passengers in the coming days. Vande Bharat sleeper, a train expected to be much better than Rajdhani Express trains, is expected to be out for trial runs by August 15, railway officials told TOI. In the meantime, Vande Metro, another new train by Indian Railways, this time for short-distance intercity travel is ready and its trial runs will start soon, officials said.Indian Railways is currently developing a sleeper version of the Vande Bharat train, following the successful introduction of the chair car variant. The sleeper train is expected to offer superior features compared to the current premium overnight travel options, such as the Rajdhani Express and Tejas Express. BEML is manufacturing the first prototype,.On the other hand, Vande Metro, also known as the Vande Bharat Metro, is inspired by the semi-high speed Vande Bharat Express and aims to transform train travel for shorter distances.","Vande Bharat sleeper prototype will have 16 coaches, including 11 AC 3 tier coaches, and one AC 2 tier coaches.

Francis brought his moral authority to bear on the G7 , invited by host Italy to address a special session on the perils and promises of AI. In doing so, he became the first pope to attend the G7. ""The benefits and the damages it causes will depend on the way it is used,"" he declared, warning of the risks of AI 's uncontrolled development. He called for lethal autonomous weapons, which are unmanned and uncontrolled by a human hand, to be banned. ""No machine should ever decide whether to take the life of a human being away.""

Francis called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically. He himself has been a victim of AI when manipulated images of him clad in a white puffer jacket and a jewel-encrusted crucifix went viral last year.

The pope's appearance was the emotional highlight of theday. Italy PM Giorgia Meloni guided the pope, in a wheelchair, around a circular table to meet the leaders, he was greeted by a visibly moved Prez Biden and got an enthusiastic hug from Argentina's flamboyant prez Javier Milei.

",Pope Francis calls for an end to the use of artificial intelligence. He says it could lead to the loss of human life. The pope is in Rome for the G7 summit.

'Mouse jiggling': How employees are fooling employers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/mouse-jiggling-how-employees-are-fooling-employers/articleshow/111017215.cms,"NEW DELHI: US Bank Wells Fargo recently fired over a dozen remote employees found to be "" mouse jiggling "" to simulate work activity. Most of them were working in the wealth and investment management unit of the lender.

Mouse jigglers are devices or software applications that became popular during the pandemic. They create an illusion of regular activity by simulating small, automatic, and random movements of the mouse cursor at set intervals. It prevents a computer from entering sleep mode or triggering its screensaver when inactive.

These are often used by employees while working from home to ensure that the computer does not mark them as inactive or enter sleep mode.

Mouse jigglers are also useful when employees need uninterrupted access to documents or files for reading or completing tasks without the screen going into sleep mode.

(With agency inputs)

A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max experienced a "" Dutch roll "" during a flight from Phoenix to Oakland , California, on May 25, causing damage to the plane's structure, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The incident occurred while the aircraft was cruising at an altitude of 34,000 feet but the airlines did not report the roll or the damage to the NTSB until June 7.""Following the event, SWA performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components,"" the safety board said.The extent and severity of the damage are not yet clear but a Southwest spokesperson confirmed the airline's participation in the investigation.A Dutch roll is an aerodynamic phenomenon characterised by a combination of yaw and rolling motions, causing the plane to sway rhythmically.Pilots are trained to recover from Dutch rolls, and modern aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers to correct the condition by adjusting the rudder.According to a preliminary report by the Federal Aviation Administration, damage was found in a unit that controls backup power to the rudder after the Southwest plane landed. The damage was described as ""substantial.""The NTSB has downloaded data from the Boeing 737 Max 8 to help determine the duration and severity of the incident. However, the cockpit voice recorder was overwritten after two hours, limiting the available information about the pilots' conversations. The pilots successfully regained control and landed the plane in Oakland without any reported injuries among the 175 passengers and six crew members.The NTSB will release a preliminary report on the incident within approximately 30 days.","A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max experienced a "" Dutch roll "" during a flight from Phoenix to Oakland, California, on May 25.

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

adaptive audio feature

Google Meet has just unveiled an update that significantly enhances the quality of recorded meetings . Previously capped at 720p, Google Meet recordings can now boast a crisp and clear 1080p resolution .This update addresses a common pain point for users who rely on recorded meetings for future reference or presentations. The improved resolution ensures sharper visuals and better readability of text and presentations shared during the meeting.Along with this, the update also brings full HD video support for meeting participants on devices equipped with 1080p cameras. While previously limited to 720p, participants can now leverage their high-definition cameras for clearer video calls . However, it's important to note that this feature is enabled by default and requires users to opt-in through the settings menu.Additionally, full HD video transmission only occurs when recording is enabled or if another participant has pinned a 1080p user's feed on a large enough screen.Recently, the video conferencing app from Google got adaptive audio feature. Adaptive audio addresses this issue by intelligently managing audio streams. Google Meet automatically detects when multiple devices in the same location are joining a meeting and synchronizes their microphones and speakers to ensure clear, echo-free audio for all participants.This allows users to collaborate seamlessly using Google Meet in conference rooms or huddle spaces with multiple laptops, without worrying about disruptive audio problems. Additionally, the adaptive audio feature eliminates the need for everyone to crowd around a single laptop for optimal audio pickup.","Google Meet has just unveiled an update that significantly enhances the quality of recorded meetings.

A man in England is suing Apple for $6.3 million, blaming the iPhone maker for his costly divorce. First reported by UK-based publication, The Times, the anonymous individual claims that his wife discovered his infidelity with sex workers through their shared iMac, where his iMessages remained despite being deleted from his iPhone. Unaware that Apple’s sync feature keeps messages across devices with the same Apple ID, he was caught off-guard when his wife stumbled upon the evidence and subsequently filed for divorce.The man has reportedly called upon London-based law firm Rosenblatt to take legal action against Apple.The lawsuit centers on the argument that iMessage’s functionality lacks clarity regarding message deletion across devices. The man believes that had the discovery been less shocking, there might have been a chance to salvage the marriage. He argues that for his wife ""it was a very brutal way of finding out. My thoughts are that if I had been able to talk to her rationally and she had not had such a brutal realisation of it, I might still be married.""""If you are told a message is deleted you are entitled to believe it's deleted,"" the man told The Times. ""If the message had said: These messages are deleted on this device,' that would have been a clue,"" Richard added. ""These messages are deleted on this device only"" would have been a much clearer indicator,” he continued.He is now seeking legal action to hold Apple accountable and is considering a class-action lawsuit to represent others who may have faced similar situations due to technological misunderstandings. He wants to establish a class-action lawsuit for other men who don't know how to work their phones.Apple device users who may not want to share their messages with the entire household should either not sync their texts across devices, or make sure iCloud for Messages is turned on, which will delete messages across devices.

What Apple has to say about the possible charges



Apple and Meta Platforms may likely face charges in the European Union . According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the tech majors may face these charges for failing to comply with the EU ’s tech rules, the Digital Markets Act, ( DMA ) which are expected to be implemented in the coming days.In March, the EU’s regulatory watchdog, the European Commission , launched investigations into Apple, Meta and Alphabet's Google under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).The report claims that the regulator sees Apple and Meta as priority cases.The DMA requires major tech companies to help smaller rivals compete and make it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores.As per the report, the EU regulators are expected to issue preliminary findings which are similar to antitrust charges before the summer break in August. The report also added that Apple may be the first to be charged, followed by Meta.With this investigation, the EU is aiming at Apple's App Store rules. Regulators claim Apple restricts developers from telling users about cheaper options outside the App Store, and they're also looking into Apple's new developer fees. Additionally, the EU is also investigating Meta's new subscription model for ad-free Facebook and Instagram.In a statement to Reuters, Apple referred to its March statement where it said that it was confident that its plan complies with the DMA and noted that it continues to constructively engage with the Commission.Companies can offer remedies to address concerns laid out in the findings before a final decision is expected before EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager leaves office in November. This may include fines up to 10% of a company's global annual turnover for breaches.Facebook-parent Meta also recently announced its plans to train its generative artificial intelligence (AI) models with content shared publicly on social media by users in Europe.After receiving backlash on the same, the company detailed how it will use the publically available content on its social media platforms.Meta also pointed out that it is not the first company to do it and directed towards Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI.","Apple and Meta Platforms may likely face charges in the European Union.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
