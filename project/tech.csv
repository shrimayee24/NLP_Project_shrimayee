Dubai Fountain to finally reopen after 5 months of renovation: Emaar reveals official date and exciting upgrades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-fountain-to-finally-reopen-after-5-months-of-renovation-emaar-reveals-official-date-and-exciting-upgrades/articleshow/123971178.cms,"While the official reopening is October 1, Dubai Fountain performances won’t resume until early October to allow final preparations/ Instagram: EmaarDubai





Dubai Fountain reopening set for early October

What’s new at the Dubai Fountain





Here’s what’s changed:





A brand-new flooring system now replaces the old foundation, which was known to crack over time. The new base is made of shiny, reinforced concrete designed to better insulate and retain water, solving a recurring maintenance issue.





Beneath that floor lies a carefully engineered waterproofing layer and an insulation system, topped with glowing blue tiles. These tiles aren’t just for looks, they reflect beautifully through the water and are visible from any vantage point around the lake.





The fountain’s choreography now relies on a new generation of robotic systems, each designed for precision:



Choreography bots guide the movement of the water itself

Lighting bots match visual effects to musical cues

Fixed water jets, dozens of them, are reprogrammed to spray in perfect rhythm with each show’s score







The scale and legacy of the Dubai Fountain





Its jets can launch water up to 150 metres high



It features 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors



Performances are choreographed to a diverse mix of classical, Arabic, and contemporary music





What to expect from the upgraded Dubai Fountain experience









After five months of silence, drained waters, and behind-the-scenes upgrades, the Dubai Fountain, the towering spectacle at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, is ready for its return. Emaar has officially announced that the world-famous attraction will be fully operational by October 1, 2025, marking the end of a massive redevelopment that touches nearly every element of the fountain’s structure and show. From state-of-the-art robotics to a brand-new underwater floor, this isn’t just maintenance, it’s a full-scale reinvention of one of Dubai’s most iconic landmarks.Dubai’s most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive upgrade that saw the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake drained, exposing the massive infrastructure beneath the surface. Now, with the waters refilled and the giant digital display screens removed, the space is beginning to take its familiar shape once again. In a recent Instagram post, Emaar stated that the Dubai Fountain is expected to be fully operational by Wednesday, October 1, although the developer noted that the attraction will not resume performances until “early October.”The developer first broke the news via Instagram, noting that while work is nearly complete, operations will resume only once the team is confident that all systems, both technical and visual, are ready for a seamless experience. So while the date is marked, there’s still a margin for final tweaks before the relaunch.This was never just a cosmetic refresh. Emaar’s redevelopment focused on the structural foundation and performance technology — rethinking the fountain from the inside out.Every movement, every beam of light, every rise and fall of the fountain is programmed, and just a single song in the show takes several weeks of fine-tuning to execute correctly. The accompanying playlist, featuring over 48 carefully selected tracks, blends classical, pop, and traditional Arabic music to reflect Dubai’s cosmopolitan spirit and cultural heritage, enhancing the fountain’s grandeur and global appeal.The result is a completely rebuilt platform that still looks like the Dubai Fountain, but performs with a new level of power, elegance, and reliability.To appreciate the effort behind this upgrade, it’s worth revisiting what the Dubai Fountain actually is, not just in reputation, but in scale.Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, the Dubai Fountain made its official debut on May 8, 2009, alongside the opening of The Dubai Mall. Spanning 275 metres across the manmade Burj Khalifa Lake, it is the largest choreographed fountain in the world.With each show, the fountain has drawn millions of visitors, becoming a staple of Downtown Dubai and one of the most recognisable water performances on the planet.And despite the closure over the past few months, Emaar ensured that the space didn’t go quiet. During redevelopment, the site was fenced off, but not hidden. The barriers were embedded with digital screens, looping archival footage of previous shows in sync with the Burj Khalifa light display, allowing visitors to still engage with the spirit of the fountain even while it was offline.Once the Dubai Fountain resumes operations in October, visitors can expect a performance that feels both familiar and entirely refreshed.The sound and light systems have been enhanced, the choreography is sharper, and the integration of robotics promises smoother, more spectacular motion than ever before. The changes aren’t just technical, they’re immersive. These upgrades were built with both performance and maintenance in mind, ensuring the fountain can continue to run spectacular shows with fewer interruptions and less wear over time.And while the core elements, the music, the light, the water, will remain central to the experience, the visual clarity, dynamic precision, and overall grandeur of the show will reflect five months of engineering and design at the highest level.","Dubai's most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive upgrade that saw the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake drained.

Meta's smart glasses now have a screen you can control with your wrist—plus two more new models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-launch-with-built-in-screen-and-wrist-controlsplus-two-more-new-models/articleshow/123962103.cms,"Can These AI Glasses Replace Your Phone? Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Tested

Poll Which feature of the Meta Ray-Ban Display excites you the most? Built-in screen Gesture controls

Second-generation Ray-Bans get major battery and camera upgrades

Athletes get their own Oakley AI Glasses with Garmin and Strava integration





Meta unveiled its most advanced smart glasses yet at its Connect conference, introducing the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display with a built-in screen and gesture controls, alongside updated versions of its popular Ray-Ban collaboration and new sports-focused Oakley frames.As the name implies, the Meta Ray-Ban Display features a full-colour, high-resolution display built into the right lens that activates only when needed, remaining invisible during regular use to avoid obstruction. Each pair includes the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that reads muscle signals from subtle finger movements and converts them into commands for controlling the glasses.CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the glasses live on stage, showing how users can check messages, preview photos, see translations, get help from Meta AI, and navigate through content using simple hand gestures detected by the wristband. The Neural Band allows users to scroll by sliding their thumb across their gripped hand, select items by pinching thumb and index finger together, and adjust volume by rotating their wrist.The display glasses offer six hours of mixed-use battery life, with the charging case providing an additional 30 hours. The wristband itself delivers 18 hours of battery life and features an IPX7 water rating. Meta built the band with Vectran, the same material used on Mars Rover crash pads, making it strong as steel when pulled yet soft enough to bend comfortably.Meta’s Ray-Ban Display can do visual responses with Meta AI, messaging and video calling through WhatsApp and Messenger, real-time camera viewfinder with zoom, pedestrian navigation with turn-by-turn directions, live captions and translation, and music playback controls.Despite some technical hiccups during the live demonstration—including failed attempts at recipe requests and video calls—Zuckerberg emphasized that these are production-ready devices, not prototypes. ""This isn't a prototype. This is here, it's ready to go and you're going to be able to buy it in a couple of weeks,"" he stated.The glasses will be available September 30th at select retailers including Best Buy, LensCrafters, and Ray-Ban stores, with expansion to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK planned for early 2026.Meta also announced the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, an improved version of its bestselling AI glasses that have sold millions of units worldwide. The updated glasses nearly double the battery life of the original model, offering up to eight hours of use compared to the previous four-hour capacity.The Gen 2 model features significant camera improvements, including 3K Ultra HD video capture with ultrawide HDR and the ability to record at up to 60 frames per second. The charging case now provides 48 hours of additional power, up from 36 hours in the original version. New software features include ""conversation focus,"" which amplifies the voice of the person you're speaking with while filtering out background noise, and expanded live translation supporting German and Portuguese alongside existing languages. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 starts at $379 and is available immediately in Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles.The Oakley Meta Vanguard targets high-intensity sports enthusiasts with specialised features for athletic performance. These $499 glasses integrate directly with Garmin devices and Strava, allowing users to ask Meta AI about heart rate, pace, and other fitness metrics in real-time without looking at their wrist or phone.The Vanguard features a wraparound design optimised for cycling helmets and hats, with IP67 dust and water resistance rating. The glasses include Meta's most powerful speakers yet—six decibels louder than previous Oakley models—and a five-microphone array designed to reduce wind noise. An autocapture feature works with Garmin to automatically record video clips when hitting distance milestones or ramping up heart rate and speed. The glasses offer nine hours of battery life and will be available October 21st, with pre-orders starting now.","The Meta Ray-Ban Display features a full-colour, high-resolution display built into the right lens that activates only when needed.

Dubai also offers competitive pricing, making it an attractive option for travelers or those considering international purchases. In contrast, countries like China, Hong Kong, and India tend to have higher prices due to local taxation and import duties. For Indian buyers, understanding these variations is essential for making informed purchase decisions, whether through local Apple stores or international channels. Overall, while the iPhone 17 series offers cutting-edge technology and premium features worldwide, the final price heavily depends on the local market’s fiscal policies and currency exchange rates.The iPhone 17, released in September 2025, marks a significant advancement in Apple's smartphone lineup.

This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and niche markets, rather than appealing to a broad mainstream consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky, heavier than expected, and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers, encouraging innovative apps, and paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event.

eam lead, India Operation Centre, ABB GISPLDuring my student days, when I was overwhelmed with thousands of lines of code or debugging for hours, I frequently wished for an invisible friend who could write code for me and correct errors instantly without straining my eyes and back. That dream has now become a reality with GitHub Copilot. For the last nine years, I have focused on C# .NET development. AI has genuinely brought my childhood dream to life; it operates beyond my expectations. Using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio feels like magic. It understands my instructions, generates hundreds of lines of code within seconds, and helps resolve both compile-time and runtime errors, allowing me to get more creative with my work. Traditional coding skills, such as manually writing and debugging thousands of lines of code from scratch, are becoming less central. AI can assist us in creating design specification documents and user manuals, becoming an indispensable part of my daily development workflow.enior cloud expert, Data Analytics, HPE IndiaThe most tangible way AI has transformed my work is by becoming an on-demand thought partner, completely redefining how I design and build.The biggest shift I’ve noticed is in the skills I lean on. I’ve moved away from memorising every detail of code syntax towards more strategic thinking. Older skills, like remembering obscure syntax, are less central now. Instead, the ability to validate and refine AI-generated code has become crucial for quality and reliability. My most eye-opening experience has been watching AI generate creative solutions that I might not have considered myself. For instance, using tools like Optuna for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning or LucidCharts AI for architectural diagrams has shown me how AI can explore vast solution spaces in seconds. It’s like having a team of brilliant minds to brainstorm with, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and helping me deliver more innovative and robust solutions.Programme Director, Data and AI, IBM India Software LabsIn my current role, I have seen how AI is reshaping how software is designed, built, and maintained. Today, instead of spending time on low-level coding tasks like boilerplate writing and syntax, I now focus more on framing clear prompts, validating AI outputs, and effectively engaging in pair programming with AI. AI tools and techniques also enhance productivity. Testing automation is a great example. Earlier, I would spend hours defining inputs, outputs, and edge scenarios. Now, AI generates a baseline suite almost instantly and suggests positive, negative, and boundary cases that I refine with business logic. AI can also analyse project requirements, design documentation, and user behaviours to align tests with realworld scenarios, allowing my team to focus on complex cases and innovation. With emerging self-healing capabilities, test cases can evolve continuously, reducing maintenance overhead and automating tasks from end to end. The result – I see faster cycles, stronger coverage, higher accuracy, and greater team productivity and engagement.Senior Director, Software Engineering, Epsilon IndiaIf you’re still debating AI adoption, you’re already falling behind — this is the next industrial revolution. Much like past technology revolutions, AI is redefining the future of engineering and embracing it is no longer optional if you want to lead rather than follow. One of the most eye-opening experiences I’ve had in AI comes from its combined impact on creativity and business processes. At Epsilon’s AI CoE, we’re witnessing how AI’s ability to generate visuals, videos, and creative content is revolutionising how ideas are expressed and products are designed. On the technical side, generative AI and large language models have amazed me with their power to reverse-engineer legacy code, effortlessly produce detailed documentation, and convert workshop call transcripts into comprehensive Business Requirement Documents. We’re also automating test case generation, load testing, and producing contextual code by understanding product documentation’s complexities — all through intuitive prompts. This fusion of creative and technical enhancement is transforming what engineers can achieve and pushing innovation at unprecedented speeds.ssociate director, center for advanced AI, advanced technology centers global network, AccentureI’ve witnessed the transformational impact of AI in a project aimed at enhancing personalised treatment options for cancer patients. By leveraging AI and image analytics to analyse cell distribution and correlate it with genomic data, we’ve gained valuable insights into diverse patient responses to similar treatments. To me, this project exemplifies the powerful fusion of human ingenuity and AI capabilities to drive meaningful innovation. With Gen AI agents contributing to tasks or portions of tasks such as design, coding, and documentation, I spend more time on strategic work such as devising innovative solution approaches, growing the practice, and upskilling my team. The human-inthe-loop is indispensable for guiding and validating AI outcomes, contextualising them to the business challenge, and ensuring highquality outcomes. To stay ahead, I advise young professionals to develop foundational skills like machine learning, programming skills like Python, and expertise in cloud AI services, while cultivating critical thinking. Following tech blogs and podcasts, GitHub projects, and experimenting with new model releases are great ways to stay updated with the latest in applied AI research.Engineering Lead, WhatfixAI is fundamentally reshaping the engineering skillset. Older skills like memorising syntax or manually searching for solutions across the web are becoming less central. The new critical abilities are problem decomposition—breaking a task into smart, strategic prompts—and the skills to critically evaluate the AI’s output for logical errors or inefficiencies. This has transformed my daily work. I now use AI as a pair programmer for everything from evaluating different technologies, writing unit tests, identifying edge case scenarios, to refactoring code. AI helps build smarter systems. We were able to move our PII detection mechanism from fragile, rule-based systems to highly effective AI models. The most eyeopening moment was seeing AI in action on a quick PoC for one of my ideas. The AI provided the entire roadmap and prototype code almost instantly, acting like an expert engineering consultant. It’s clear that the role of engineers is evolving from just writing code to architecting and directing AI-driven solutions. I’m excited for the times ahead.Manager, LatentView AnalyticsOne clear example where AI saves time is writing test cases from requirements. Earlier, I would manually read through feature requirements or user stories, identify edge cases, and write out each test case line by line. This was time-consuming and often prone to human error or missed scenarios. Now, I can paste the user story or requirement into an AI tool, and it generates a comprehensive list of test scenarios, including edge cases like invalid inputs, timeout handling, or multi-device logins. All I need to do is review, validate, and refine — saving nearly 60–70% of the time compared to manual creation. My most surprising experience using AI at work was realising just how much it can accelerate creativity and problemsolving—not just automating repetitive tasks. For example, early on, I used AI tools mainly to speed up routine coding or generate test cases. But what really opened my eyes was when I started leveraging AI as a collaborative partner during brainstorming sessions and solution design.Director of IT IS & CISO, HughesAI has completely transformed our workflow, especially in our CI/CD pipelines. The old way was a time-consuming, reactive cycle: a build would fail from a simple error, and a developer would have to manually find and fix it. Today, our AI-powered pipeline is different. It acts as a smart assistant, catching and auto-resolving many of these common issues before the build is complete.We’re also using AI in our cybersecurity team to drastically reduce false positives in our security alerts. This means our team can spend their time on genuine threats, making our work more efficient and accurate than ever before. What has surprised me most is how AI helps us learn things outside our usual IT responsibilities. It acts like a knowledge connector. As an IT engineer, my world was once limited to technical issues. Today, AI allows me to link my work to other departments, giving me a much broader view of the business. It’s an eye-opening shift.Project Manager in Generative AI Centre of Competence, Siemens Healthineers Development CentreUse of AI tools and solutions has helped to save time but it varies depending on the context. One of the biggest time-savers for me has been managing requirements and test cases. Earlier, the process of creating user stories, acceptance criteria, and test cases was slow and tedious. It involved multiple discussions with stakeholders to understand highlevel requirements, breaking them into features, and testers going back and forth to clarify details. The entire process was simplified with the help of an AIassisted requirement and test management tool. It generates user stories with proper acceptance criteria from high-level requirements. Once the user is satisfied with the generated output, with a single click, the work item is created in the repository. This is helping requirement engineers, developers, and testers get faster access to complete the development and testing activities.Principal Solutions Architect, AntStackClaude Code has transformed how I build serverless solutions. When developing proof of concepts or adding features to existing codebases, it creates intelligent feedback loops that identify and fix issues before I even run the code. Previously, integrating new platforms into our tech stack meant hours of documentation reading and debugging. Now, Claude Code understands architectural patterns and suggests fixes in real time. My most eye-opening experience has been discovering how AI accelerates learning itself – not just coding, but understanding new technological concepts and architectural patterns. When constantly evaluating new serverless technologies, I engage in real-time conversations with Claude and ChatGPT that help me connect dots I might miss. It’s like having a senior engineer available 24/7 who explains concepts from multiple angles. The most surprising moment was when Claude Code helped me understand complex serverless orchestration by walking through underlying architectural principles – not just solving my immediate problem, but expanding my mental model of how these systems work together. This changed how I approach learning.Software Developer, Advanced Analytics R&D, SAS R&D IndiaWhat has surprised me the most about using AI is how it supports so many parts of my daily work. Whether I am designing APIs, generating mock data, writing unit tests, or brainstorming UI layouts, AI speeds up tasks in ways I never expected. Sometimes it helps me catch tricky bugs. Other times, it suggests cleaner code or points out edge cases I might have missed. It has even helped me draft documentation, write clearer emails, or take accurate meeting minutes, saving me time and mental energy. AI has not replaced my role. If anything, it has made me faster, sharper, and more focused on solving the big-picture problems. It feels like having a super-helpful pair programmer who never gets tired or judges my weird 3 a.m. questions. Honestly, the biggest lesson I have learnt is not to be afraid of AI. It is a powerful tool and by embracing it, I have more time and energy to focus on the creative and challenging parts of building great products.Senior Architect, CognizantMy journey in IT began with pair programming where I huddled over a single monitor with my buddy. We learned, debugged, and grew together. Coffee breaks were a crucial part of the process. Today, my co-pilot is an AI. It lives in my workspace, a tireless partner that generates code with a well-crafted prompt. While it can’t join me for coffee, its impact is just as profound. As a Senior Architect, my days were filled with understanding complex systems and creating diagrams, often slowed by scheduled meetings across time zones to gather insights from each team. Now, instead of reaching out to multiple teams for understanding, I simply ask a chatbot (powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation) for a diagram, and it delivers in seconds, trained on a mountain of client documentation. The most valuable skill I’ve gained isn’t a new programming language, but the art of collaboration with my virtual partner, making our teamwork more efficient and focused than ever before.","AI is revolutionising how ideas are expressed and products are designed.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet officially confirmed the exact status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will likely follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways. This year’s celebrations are also expected to set new records in tourism and retail spending, reflecting the growing impact of National Day on the UAE’s economy.","The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2.

Google Pay in Saudi Arabia





What Google Pay offers: Core features

Card Support Across Networks: Users can add and manage Mada debit cards as well as digital credit and prepaid cards from Visa and Mastercard.



Contactless Payments (Tap to Pay): Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals.



(Tap to Pay): Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals. In-App and Online Transactions: Soon, the service will also enable purchases within apps and on websites.



Google Wallet Integration: The Google Wallet app, which powers the Google Pay experience, also allows users to store loyalty cards, event tickets, boarding passes, and other digital items in one centralized location for easy access.



Security Architecture: A key strength of the platform is its multi-layered security. Instead of transmitting real card data during transactions, it uses tokenization, creating a device-specific virtual card number with a dynamic security code that refreshes with every payment. This ensures that actual card details remain protected throughout the transaction process.



Ease of Use: Activation is streamlined. Users only need to download the Google Wallet or Google Pay app, sign in with their Google account, add a bank card, and complete a quick security verification. Once set up, the phone is ready for tap-to-pay functionality.





Limitations and drawbacks: What users should consider

Restricted Bank Support at Launch: Only Riyad Bank and Al Rajhi Bank cards are supported at present. Cards issued by other banks may not yet be functional with Google Pay, though wider support is planned in upcoming phases.



Android-Only Compatibility: The service is not available to iPhone users, which confines access to users of Android smartphones or Wear OS smartwatches.



Point-of-Sale Gaps: While major retailers and e-commerce platforms already accept Google Pay, some smaller vendors may lack the necessary infrastructure or awareness to support it. This is expected to improve over time but may be an obstacle during the early adoption phase.



Dependence on Internet Connectivity: A stable internet connection is essential for initiating and verifying some transactions, especially during card addition or initial setups. In areas with poor network access, users may face interruptions or failed transactions.

How to get started: Step-by-step activation

Download the Google Wallet (or Google Pay) app from the Google Play Store.

Sign in using the Google account associated with the device.

Tap “Add Card” in the app interface.

Scan or manually enter your card details.

Complete the security verification process via your bank’s authentication method.

Once verified, your device is ready for contactless transactions.

Market impact: Google Pay enters a crowded field





Google Pay is now officially available to Android users in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant step in the Kingdom’s digital transformation efforts. Launched on September 15, 2025, in collaboration with the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), the service brings contactless, secure payments through Android devices, with full integration into the national payment infrastructure, Mada. Here’s a detailed look at how it works, who can use it, what it offers, and what it doesn’t.The formal rollout of Google Pay in Saudi Arabia was announced during the Money20/20 Middle East event, held at the Riyadh International Convention and Exhibition Center in Mulham. This initiative, developed jointly by Google and SAMA, represents a major addition to the local digital payments ecosystem.The service operates through Mada, the national payment network, and is part of the broader push under Vision 2030 to reduce reliance on cash and enhance the Kingdom’s financial infrastructure. It also aligns with the Financial Sector Development Program, which encourages adoption of modern financial technologies and a shift toward a cashless society.Currently, Al Rajhi Bank and Riyad Bank support the service, with additional banks set to join in phases.

Each of these services brings its own features and integrations, but Google Pay’s tight integration with Android systems and its global brand familiarity could offer it a distinct edge.Its introduction is expected to drive further adoption of digital wallets, especially across retail outlets, restaurants, transportation services, and e-commerce platforms, contributing to a more digitized and efficient consumer economy.",Google Pay is now officially available to Android users in Saudi Arabia.

UPI's global expansion strategy: A vision for the future









The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has rapidly gained global attention for revolutionizing digital payments in India, and its expansion is now making waves in the Middle East, especially across the GCC nations. UPI, which allows for instant and secure transactions across multiple bank accounts, has been rolled out in countries like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, providing both Indian nationals and tourists with a seamless payment experience.UPI, a system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has become one of the most successful fintech innovations, boasting over ₹20 trillion in transactions by September 2024. Initially launched in India in 2016, UPI has enabled users to send and receive money in real time without sharing sensitive bank account details. As part of its ambitious internationalization strategy, NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL) has been driving UPI's expansion globally, with the goal of making the payment system available in 20 countries by FY29.So far, UPI has been rolled out in 12 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, France, and others.In the GCC, UPI is currently available in four countries: the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. As more banks provide support, additional countries are expected to join the UPI network soon.Since 2022, UPI has expanded beyond India, initially reaching select Middle Eastern countries. With recent launches in Qatar and Oman, the GCC region is now a key player in UPI’s international growth, offering significant benefits to millions of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Indian tourists.The UAE became the first country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to roll out UPI payments. In 2022, UPI became available via the NeoPay app, enabling Indian expats to link their international mobile numbers and perform transactions without the need for an Indian SIM card. Recently, in 2025, an important update was made, allowing Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in the UAE to access UPI without the necessity of having an Indian mobile number. This milestone significantly improved the digital payment experience for the Indian diaspora and tourists in the UAE, offering familiar and convenient payment methods.Notably, UPI payments are accepted across retail outlets, supermarkets, transportation services, and tourist spots like Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates. Indian tourists—who make up a significant portion of the UAE's visitors—are expected to reach 5.29 million in 2024 alone. For them, UPI brings an instant and secure payment solution without the need for cash or international cards, streamlining cross-border transactions.In 2023, Oman became the seventh country to embrace UPI and RuPay, following Singapore, Nepal, the UAE, Bhutan, Malaysia, and France. The launch in Oman was marked by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between NPCI, NIPL, and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) on October 4, 2022. This collaboration allows for real-time cross-border payments and the use of RuPay cards across Oman's ATM networks, POS terminals, and e-commerce platforms.With a significant number of Indian nationals living and working in Oman, UPI's introduction offers an efficient, cost-effective way for remittances to flow between India and Oman, a crucial feature for Indian expatriates.Qatar started integrating UPI payments in 2023, making it easier for Indian tourists and residents to pay at retail outlets, tourist spots, and other businesses using popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm . Then, in July 2024, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) teamed up with Qatar National Bank (QNB), a major milestone in expanding UPI acceptance across QNB’s merchant network. This partnership ensures that Indian visitors to Qatar now have a seamless and familiar payment experience.Qatar’s tourism industry, which sees a lot of Indian visitors, is about to get even more convenient with UPI payments. On September 16, 2025, Commercial Bank of Qatar teamed up with NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) to bring UPI QR code payments to its merchants. This makes paying easier for Indian tourists and strengthens Qatar’s push for a cashless economy.Saudi Arabia has been another important addition to the UPI network, with NRIs in the kingdom already able to link Saudi (+966) mobile numbers to their Indian bank accounts. This system facilitates cross-border remittances and everyday transactions through the UPI platform. Additionally, Indian expats living in Saudi Arabia can link their international mobile numbers to their NRE/NRO accounts, making it easier for them to use UPI apps such as PhonePe and Google Pay.One of the most appealing aspects of UPI for NRIs in the GCC is that it enables them to make transactions without needing an Indian mobile number. By linking an international mobile number to their NRE or NRO account, users can transfer funds to and from their Indian bank accounts through a variety of UPI-enabled apps, including PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and BHIM.Here’s how you can set up UPI with an international mobile number:AU Small Finance Bank, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, City Union Bank, DBS Bank Ltd, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank.NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), is driving the global expansion of UPI and RuPay. As of September 2025, UPI is live in 12 countries, including major trading partners like Singapore, Australia, the USA, and the UK. NIPL’s partnerships with institutions like QNB and Network International in the Middle East are pushing UPI deeper into global payment systems.With a focus on cross-border remittances and smoother experiences for international travelers, UPI is quickly becoming a key player in global fintech. These collaborations are helping promote India’s digital payments while supporting the growth of real-time payment systems worldwide.","Since 2022, UPI has expanded beyond India, initially reaching select Middle Eastern countries.

No more paper!

Digital IDs and driver’s licenses gain full legal status in Oman





Flexibility introduced with new expat residence cards in Oman





Renewal rules and compliance in Oman





Impact on citizens and residents: Digital identity in Oman





The Royal Oman Police (ROP) has made a significant stride in digital transformation by legally recognizing certified electronic versions of national ID cards and driver’s licenses. This new measure allows citizens and residents to access and use these documents online with the same legal validity as physical copies, simplifying daily procedures and aligning with Oman’s broader goals for government modernization and convenience.The Royal Oman Police has officially announced that certified electronic copies of the national ID card and driver’s license are now legally valid throughout Oman. These digital documents can be accessed directly via the ROP’s official website, eliminating the need to carry physical versions or visit service centers for many transactions. First Lieutenant Salem bin Saeed Al-Farsi, Project Manager for Digital Identity at ROP, confirmed that electronic documents hold equal legal weight as their hardcopy counterparts and can be used in all official situations, including when presenting identification to government authorities or police officers.This move marks an important milestone in Oman’s commitment to digital government services, enhancing convenience for both citizens and residents. The shift reduces paperwork, speeds up verification processes, and supports a streamlined approach to identity management.In parallel with the digital ID rollout, the Royal Oman Police recently introduced flexible residence cards for expatriates with validity periods ranging from one to three years. This update aims to provide greater flexibility and ease in the renewal process for the diverse expatriate population living in Oman.The introduction of these flexible residence permits comes alongside changes to the validity period of Omani citizens’ personal identity cards, which has been extended from the previous 10 years to match the duration of the Omani passport.Despite the extended validity and new formats, all residents and citizens must renew their residence cards and ID documents within 30 days of their expiration date to remain compliant with legal requirements. These renewal protocols are part of Oman’s broader efforts to modernize civil status laws and improve the efficiency of residency management.The government’s focus on updating these systems benefits Oman’s population by making document management more convenient and cost-effective, reflecting the ongoing commitment to digital transformation and public service improvement.With these updates, Oman’s residents and citizens are set to experience smoother administrative processes and greater ease in proving identity across the country. The move toward digital certified documents not only facilitates day-to-day interactions with government entities but also supports Oman’s vision for a fully digital, efficient, and modern public service infrastructure. The adoption of digital IDs empowers users with instant, secure access to essential documents, reducing wait times and enhancing overall service efficiency across Oman.In summary, Oman’s recognition of digital national IDs and driver’s licenses, along with the new flexible residence cards and extended validity periods, represent key steps toward a more accessible, secure, and user-friendly identity system for all who live in the Sultanate.","The Royal Oman Police (ROP) has made a significant stride in digital transformation by legally recognizing certified electronic versions of national ID cards and driver’s licenses.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

Why DeepSeek and its model made waves in US tech industry



iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Series Mega Unboxing





Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals. After launch, the DeepSeek R1 model stood out for its cost-efficient development and its open-source nature, offering unlimited free usage to a wide audience. Its emergence as a direct competitor to models from industry leaders such as OpenAI Google , and Anthropic has brought new scrutiny to the financial investments required for AI development.According to a report by Reuters, DeepSeek revealed that the company spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train its R1 model. This figure was published in a peer-reviewed article in the academic journal Nature.The company’s disclosure may reignite a debate in the tech industry over why US giants are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train large language models (LLMs).DeepSeek's release of what it claimed were lower-cost AI systems in January caused investors to sell off tech stocks, as they worried the new models could threaten the dominance of companies like Nvidia. The update, which is the first cost estimate the Hangzhou-based company has released for its R1 model, appeared in a paper co-authored by its founder, Liang Wenfeng.The paper specified that the reasoning-focused model was trained using 512 Nvidia H800 chips.By comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2023 that ""foundational model training"" had cost ""much more"" than $100 million, though his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported.Some of DeepSeek's previous claims about its development costs and technology have been questioned by US companies and officials. The company’s use of H800 chips comes after the US in October 2022 made it illegal for Nvidia to export its more powerful H100 and A100 AI chips to China.In a supplementary document to the Nature article, DeepSeek acknowledged for the first time that it does own A100 chips and used them in the “preparatory stages of development” for R1.US officials claimed in June that DeepSeek had access to “large volumes” of H100 chips procured after export controls were in place, a claim Nvidia has denied, stating that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 chips.","Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals.

At Meta's annual Connect event, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was left red-faced after a live demonstration of the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and accompanying neural wristband suffered a technical glitch. During the presentation, Zuckerberg successfully demonstrated the wristband's subtle gesture-based typing but the system failed to respond when he tried to initiate a video call using hand motions. The failed demo quickly went viral, with some observers drawing comparisons to the infamous on-stage ""armor glass"" shattering incident at the Tesla Cybertruck launch that shocked Elon Musk The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses feature a heads-up display on the right lens to show notifications and directions, a major upgrade from previous models. The accompanying neural wristband is designed to allow users to control the glasses with subtle hand gestures.During the demo, Zuckerberg successfully used the wristband to send text messages to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth. However, when he attempted to initiate a video call using a hand gesture, the system failed to respond. This happened even after several attempts.“That’s too bad,” Zuckerberg said, adding, “ I don’t know what happened.”Bosworth eventually joined him on stage, commenting on the poor Wi-Fi connection. Zuckerberg admitted the moment was unexpected, saying, “We'll debug that later. You practice these things like 100 times, and then you never know what's going to happen.”The video of the failed demo quickly spread on social media like Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), prompting a range of reactions from X users.One user commented that the Wi-Fi excuse was ""not really believable,"" while another joked about seeing the ""raw uncut footage"" of Zuckerberg's reaction afterward.In 2019, Musk was presenting the Cybertruck and during the live demo, lead designer Franz von Holzhausen smashed two of the vehicle's “armor glass” windows on stage with a metal ball. The unexpected failure left Musk visibly stunned but handled the situation by saying, “It didn’t go through”.Following the incident, Musk took to Twitter to explain what went wrong. He said that a prior test, where the door was hit with a sledgehammer, had ""cracked the base of the glass."" This initial impact, according to Musk, weakened the windows and caused them to shatter when subsequently hit with the metal ball.",Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and accompanying neural wristband suffered a technical glitch.
