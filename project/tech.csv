MUMBAI: A friendly female dog, Nemo, who lives in and around Pil Court building in Churchgate, recently underwent a misadventure when she nervously jumped into a train at Churchgate station to escape the loud bursting of crackers. The train carried her all the way to the suburbs, and she was finally found 17 days later at Kandivli West.Worried residents launched a search through online networks. Theatre personality Anahita Uberoi told TOI, “Nemo is a popular dog here, so we were all sad when she ran away on the last day of Ganpati immersions due to the loud crackers. Many searched across south Mumbai but couldn’t find her.”Few imagined Nemo had travelled ticketless by train. A breakthrough came after 10 days when a dog feeder, Jenny, spotted her in Kandivli. A railway canteen boy and a local hawker also reported sightings and even fed her to keep her around. Finally, on Day 17, the canteen boy called to say Nemo was with him. “Her main caregiver, Ram Singh, was the happiest,” Uberoi said.","Nemo the dog jumped into a train at Churchgate station to escape the loud bursting of crackers.

After nearly six months of silence, the Dubai Fountain made its long-awaited return with a newly upgraded showcase that drew thousands to the heart of Downtown. According to local media, by late afternoon, the edges of Burj Lake were packed with visitors families, tourists, and residents, many raising their phones to capture photos and videos. People rushed to secure prime spots along the promenade and boardwalk, eager for the best views as the crowd grew steadily ahead of the 6:30 PM performance.Ahead of the relaunch, the enhanced sound system at Dubai Mall reportedly began playing music across the waterfront. Boats were observed preparing the lake’s surface for the evening show, contributing to a growing sense of anticipation as the start time neared.The inaugural performance featured “Emsaha Dubai” by Coral Al Emarat, a four-minute patriotic anthem whose title translates to “The name is Dubai.” The song is dedicated to the city’s leadership, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the late Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, celebrating their vision and steadfast support. This was followed by a second display, choreographed to “Time to Say Goodbye” by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman , a classic orchestral piece that has become a staple in large-scale musical events.Subsequent shows continued through the evening at 30-minute intervals, including a composition by Grammy-winning artist Christopher Tin, a Mandarin pop song that resonated with visiting tour groups from China, and Adele’s “Skyfall”, a crowd favourite from past fountain playlists. The return program was designed to offer a renewed but familiar experience, blending emotional resonance with technical brilliance.According to Khaleej Times, large numbers of spectators stayed on to watch multiple rounds of the show, capturing photos and videos of the returning spectacle. Each performance, though built on the same upgraded systems, varied in music and choreography, adding to the draw for those who stayed to watch more than once.The fountain's return comes after a five-month closure, announced in February by Emaar Properties, to allow for a full-scale overhaul. The goal was not just cosmetic enhancement, but a reengineering of its foundational systems for better durability and performance.These enhancements aim to improve show reliability, reduce maintenance needs, and offer a smoother experience to spectators while preserving the fountain’s original identity.Originally unveiled on 8 May 2009 during The Dubai Mall’s grand opening, the Dubai Fountain was designed by WET Design — the creators of the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas. It quickly became the world's largest choreographed (Dancing) fountain, stretching 275 metres across the manmade Burj Lake and capable of shooting 22,000 gallons of water up to 150 metres in the air. The project cost approximately AED 800 million (about ₹18 billion at the time).Powered by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, the fountain has mesmerised over 14 million visitors annually, weaving stories through movement, light, and sound. Music choices over the years have included global names like Adele, Pavarotti, Edith Piaf, Lionel Richie, and K-pop group EXO, among others.During the shutdown, Emaar maintained public engagement by installing 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the Dubai Mall promenade, looping archival footage of past shows in sync with Burj Khalifa’s LED displays — preserving a sense of connection to the fountain, even as physical shows paused.With its return, the Dubai Fountain is now operating on new show timings:","Dubai Fountain made its long-awaited return with a newly upgraded showcase that drew thousands to the heart of Downtown.

Always back up existing worlds, since snapshots can potentially corrupt saves.

Aravind Srinivas has debuted on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025. With a net worth of Rs 21,190 crore, the 31-year-old co-founder and CEO of Perplexity AI has become the country’s youngest billionaire. The Chennai-born entrepreneur's entry into the rankings sets a new record for Indian wealth. The Hurun report highlighted Srinivas's rise as a sign of India’s economic transition, marking a shift from a services-centric economy toward a deep-tech, product-led powerhouse. His fortune was built by creating a foundational AI model that competes with global technology giants, rather than inheriting wealth or coming from traditional industries.Srinivas’ journey reflects the rise of India’s new-age tech entrepreneurs. Born in Chennai in 1994, he showed a strong interest in science from an early age. He pursued dual degrees in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras, where he also taught reinforcement learning, and later earned a PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. His research focused on reinforcement learning, image generation, and vision models.Srinivas gained formative experience at leading AI labs, including OpenAI Google , and DeepMind, contributing to projects such as DALL-E 2, HaloNet, and ResNet-RS.These stints gave him the expertise to launch his own venture.In August 2022, he co-founded Perplexity AI with Denis Yarats and Andy Konwinski. The startup’s vision was simple yet powerful: a chat-based search engine offering fast, accurate, and trustworthy answers. Perplexity quickly scaled, attracting marquee investors like Jeff Bezos , while also drawing buyout interest from Apple and Meta. However, Srinivas has emphasised that the company will remain independent, with plans for an IPO after 2028.According to the M3M Hurun Rich List, his wealth is estimated at ₹21,190 crore, surpassing peers such as Zepto founders Kaivalya Vohra and Aadit Palicha, OYO’s Ritesh Agarwal, BharatPe’s Shashvat Nakrani, and TAC Security’s Trishneet Arora. This new generation of Indian entrepreneurs is notably younger, globally minded, and product-driven.India also plays a central role in Perplexity’s future. With the country emerging as its most extensive user base, Srinivas has signalled plans to launch a Perplexity fund to support Indian AI startups, while continuing to back ventures like ElevenLabs and Suno.","Aravind Srinivas has debuted on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025.

The service is open to most residents and visitors (with a key exception for Muslim UAE nationals) and is designed to be fast, internationally recognised and simple to navigate. If you’re planning to marry in Abu Dhabi, here’s a clear, practical guide to who can apply, what to prepare, how the ceremony works, the fees and why the reform matters for expatriates.Abu Dhabi’s civil-marriage scheme is governed by Abu Dhabi Law No. 14 of 2021 and applies to people regardless of religion or nationality, except for UAE nationals who are Muslims they remain subject to Sharia-based family law. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, give mutual consent, must not be married to someone else, and must not be related within the first or second degree. Tourists and non-residents can apply online and must travel to Abu Dhabi for the ceremony once approved. The move to allow civil marriage grew from wider UAE reforms introduced since 2021 to provide non-religious personal-status options and align with international norms.Couples can submit applications through the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department’s online portal or at authorised typing centres. The core documents are passports (and Emirates ID if resident), a completed application form, and proof that any prior marriage has been legally dissolved (divorce decree or death certificate).A prenuptial agreement is optional. There are two service tracks: the standard service (about AED 300, processed within roughly 10 working days) and an express option (around AED 2,500) that can be processed in one working day and lets couples choose the ceremony date. After approval, the court schedules the ceremony at its Civil Family Court.On the ceremony day both parties attend the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court with IDs; no external witnesses are required because the civil marriage officer serves as the legal witness. Vows are played via a pre-recorded audio available in multiple languages, though couples can exchange rings, recite their own vows and bring guests or a photographer. After signing, the marriage certificate is legally binding; many couples choose to have the certificate attested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for overseas use and embassy recognition. The process is intentionally straightforward to ensure the marriage is widely accepted by foreign authorities.Abu Dhabi has emerged as a preferred destination for non-Muslim expatriates and mixed-nationality couples seeking to formalize their unions legally. For many, coming from countries with strict marriage laws, religious restrictions, or cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Abu Dhabi offers a simpler, faster, and transparent system. Unlike traditional procedures that may require approval from multiple authorities or religious institutions, the civil marriage framework in Abu Dhabi allows couples to complete the process efficiently through a single legal channel.The system is particularly appealing for couples who previously faced hurdles due to differences in religion or nationality. Expats report that the process is streamlined, well-documented, and predictable, reducing both time and administrative stress. By providing a legally recognized, state-backed platform, Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for couples who want their marriage to be valid, hassle-free, and compliant with international legal standards.One of the biggest draws of Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage system is its legal robustness and international recognition. Marriage certificates issued here are accepted in most countries worldwide, making them highly valuable for practical purposes such as visa applications, bank accounts, inheritance rights, and other family law matters.This global validity ensures that couples do not face disputes or complications when moving, working, or studying abroad. The civil certificate also acts as a formal proof of marital status, recognized by governments and institutions alike, which can simplify processes like sponsorship for spouses, property ownership, and social benefits. For expatriates, having a legally enforceable marriage document from Abu Dhabi provides peace of mind, ensuring that their rights and obligations are protected both locally and internationally.","Abu Dhabi’s civil marriage service lets couples solemnize a legally recognized, secular marriage at the Abu Dhabi Civil Family Court.

Viral photo of Princess Elisabeth of Belgium and Prince Georg of Liechtenstein





A photo claiming to show Princess Elisabeth of Belgium with Prince Georg of Liechtenstein has been declared fake by royal officials, who confirmed it was generated using artificial intelligence. The image, which spread widely on social media this week, sparked speculation of a budding romance between two European royal houses for the first time in decades.The picture appeared to show Princess Elisabeth, heir to the Belgian throne, standing close to Prince Georg during a supposed private outing. It quickly went viral, with tabloids and social media users suggesting it hinted at a relationship between the two young royals. For many observers, the image represented what could have been the first link between Belgium’s royal family and Liechtenstein’s princely house in more than 50 years.Belgium’s royal household swiftly dismissed the photo, clarifying that it had never taken place and was “entirely artificial.” Officials stressed that Elisabeth, currently studying at Oxford University, was focused on her education and future royal responsibilities.The Liechtenstein family has not issued an official comment but sources close to the household echoed the Belgian palace’s position that the photo was fabricated.Experts noted that the image bore hallmarks of AI generation, including inconsistencies in background details. Digital forensics analysts highlighted how advances in artificial intelligence make it increasingly difficult for casual viewers to distinguish between authentic and fabricated images. The incident has reignited debates about AI misinformation, especially concerning public figures and young royals who may be targeted by viral but false narratives.Social media platforms lit up with a mix of humor, disappointment, and criticism once the photo was debunked. Some fans expressed amusement at how believable the AI-generated image looked, while others warned of the dangers of spreading misinformation, especially when it affects the reputation of young royals. A few users voiced disappointment, saying they had briefly enjoyed the idea of a “royal love story.”The fake photo of Princess Elisabeth and Prince Georg shows how quickly AI-generated content can spread, shaping public perception before facts catch up. For the Belgian royal family, the incident was not just about quashing romance rumors but also about highlighting the growing challenge of digital misinformation in an era where truth and fabrication are increasingly hard to separate.","Photo of Princess Elisabeth of Belgium with Prince Georg of Liechtenstein declared fake.

The Dubai Fountain: Largest choreographed fountain in the world









After five months of intensive redevelopment, the Dubai Fountain is set to officially reopen on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. Emaar has confirmed the date and shared details about a thorough two-phase upgrade designed to boost the fountain’s performance, technology, and overall visitor experience. With a revamped infrastructure, state-of-the-art robotics, and refreshed visuals, the iconic Downtown Dubai attraction is ready to return bigger and better than ever. Visitors can look forward to smoother, more precise shows featuring enhanced lighting, sharper choreography, and stunning water displays that promise to captivate both longtime fans and first-time viewers alike.The Dubai Fountain will resume operations on Wednesday, October 1, following a complete five-month shutdown that began on April 19, 2025. While speculation had circulated on social media in the weeks leading up to the confirmation, developer Emaar officially announced the reopening on September 27.The first show marking the grand return is scheduled for 6:30 PM on October 1. Regular showtimes will resume as follows:The reopening marks the completion of Phase One of the redevelopment project. Phase Two, introducing additional new features, is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2026.The first phase involved a full-scale shutdown of the attraction, during which the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake was drained. This enabled major structural work, including:This deep structural work was essential to ensure both performance reliability and long-term maintenance efficiency, while preserving the fountain’s original grandeur.During this five-month closure, the site remained accessible visually. Emaar installed 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the Dubai Mall promenade. These screens showcased looped archival footages of past performances in sync with the visuals of Burj Khalifa light displays, maintaining a sense of continuity and visitor engagement despite the ongoing construction.The redevelopment is more than cosmetic—it represents a fundamental reengineering of how the Dubai Fountain operates.Key upgrades now integrated include:These changes aim to deliver smoother motion, richer sensory experience, and overall improved show reliability. The system is designed to require less maintenance, reducing potential downtime in the future.Despite all the upgrades, the iconic identity of the Dubai Fountain remains intact, with water jets spraying up to 22,000 gallons of water as high as 150 metres into the air at any given time, illuminated by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, all now performing on a more resilient and technologically advanced platform.The work isn’t fully complete. Emaar confirmed that the reopening marks only the end of the first phase. Phase Two, expected to conclude by Q2 2026, will introduce additional technological features and creative enhancements.While specific elements of the second phase are still under wraps, Emaar has emphasized that it will combine creativity and next-generation technology to continue evolving the fountain experience and deliver “fresh moments of wonder.”Mohamed Alabbar, Founder of Emaar, described the reopening as a symbolic moment for Dubai:The Dubai Fountain, originally launched on May 8, 2009, remains the largest choreographed fountain in the world, stretching 275 metres across the manmade lake beneath the Burj Khalifa. Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, it has long been a centrepiece of Downtown Dubai’s global allure.Now, with an entirely upgraded infrastructure and advanced show capabilities, it’s ready to reclaim its place in the city’s cultural spotlight—offering both returning and first-time visitors a renewed experience that blends technology, spectacle, and architectural ambition.The wait is over.

As schools reopen in Abu Dhabi for the 2025–26 academic year, a major update in student transport policy by the Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) is taking effect, and every parent needs to be prepared. From who can pick up your child, to whether they can ride a scooter to school, these new rules are detailed, safety-focused, and carry clear responsibilities for families. Here's a breakdown of everything you must know as the school run begins.One of the most significant updates affects older students. Starting this academic year, students in Cycle 3 (Grades 9–12, ages 14–18) are allowed to commute independently to and from school without using school transport. This includes the use of bicycles, scooters, or other personal transport — as long as certain conditions are met.However, parents must sign a detailed consent form that confirms:If a school does allow the use of personal vehicles like bikes or scooters on its premises, it must provide dedicated infrastructure, including tracks and parking spaces. Schools also retain the right to regulate how and where these are used within the campus.Important: The school is not liable for any incidents that occur while the student is commuting independently — this responsibility falls to the parents.For students under 15, independent travel is not allowed. These students must be picked up and dropped off by an adult, either a parent or a parent-appointed guardian. If no adult is present at the drop-off point, the child will be taken back to school after all other students are dropped off.However, there's some flexibility if you have older children:This system ensures that younger children are never left unsupervised during transit, while giving families a practical option when an adult isn’t available for pick-up.School buses are strictly reserved for student transportation. However, for field trips, tourist buses may be used, as long as they meet technical and safety standards like:The maximum allowable time for a school bus journey is 60 minutes — from the first pick-up point to the last drop-off. Students can only be picked up and dropped off at pre-designated locations.For students under 11 years old, a bus supervisor must ensure that a parent or appointed guardian is physically present at the drop-off point. If no one is available, the student will be safely returned to school.Each bus carrying students under age 11 must have a registered supervisor, in addition to a driver. Both the driver and supervisor must hold ITC permits.Bus transport fees are regulated and must align with the ITC School Bus Fee Framework. Operators propose the fee, which must be approved by ADEK. Any exceptional increases require prior coordination with ITC.To help parents stay informed and reassured, schools will use Salama — a school transport monitoring application developed by the Integrated Transport Centre (ITC) of Abu Dhabi. This app is designed to enhance school bus safety by offering parents full visibility into their child’s daily commute.Through Salama, parents can:The bus supervisor must maintain regular communication with both parents and the school, and is responsible for:Every school must appoint a School Transport Coordinator, whose contact information must be shared with parents and bus operators. This person is the main contact for any issue that goes beyond the bus supervisor’s duties, including:Schools are required to implement traffic control plans for safe pick-up and drop-off:The updated school transport policy by ADEK is not just a set of rules, it’s a framework to ensure every child’s journey to and from school is safe, structured, and well-supervised.Whether your child is taking the school bus, riding a scooter, or getting picked up by an older sibling, there are clear expectations and shared responsibilities between schools, parents, and students.To stay compliant, and ensure your child’s safety, make sure to:","Abu Dhabi schools reopen for the 2025–26 academic year.

“Driving the Future of Transport and Global Connectivity,”





Etihad Rail’s ambitious passenger train project took center stage at the Global Rail 2025 exhibition in Abu Dhabi, where visitors got their first close look at the soon-to-be operational service set to redefine intercity travel across the UAE. The event, held at ADNEC Centre, gathered international leaders and experts to spotlight innovation and cooperation in transport and connectivity.The Global Rail 2025 exhibition and conference opened today at ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi and will continue through October 2. Held under the themethe event has drawn significant international attention, welcoming over 20 ministerial delegations and industry leaders from both the public and private sectors. With participants from more than 100 nationalities, the three-day gathering is expected to receive over 20,000 international visitors.Spanning four exhibition halls, the event features more than 200 companies and brands from 14 key sectors, including infrastructure, rolling stock, digital innovation, finance, and smart mobility. Over 70 companies are debuting at this year’s exhibition, and more than 11 national rail operators are in attendance.A major highlight of the exhibition has been Etihad Rail’s unveiling of its upcoming passenger train cabins—marking the first public look into what the future of rail travel in the UAE will look like. The sleek, silver train model displayed prominently at the venue features the distinctive black and red Etihad Rail branding and gives visitors a tangible preview of what’s to come when passenger operations begin in 2026.The passenger trains will include three distinct travel classes: economy, family, and first class. The economy cabin features dark grey, back-to-back seating; the family cabin offers face-to-face seats with a long central table for group convenience; and the first-class cabin provides wider, adjustable seats designed for comfort. All cabins come equipped with tray tables, overhead luggage compartments, and additional dedicated spaces for larger baggage.Passengers will enter stations through automated ticket barriers. While it is encouraged to book tickets online in advance, ticket vending machines will also be available at stations. A sample of the machine on display shows it as black and grey in color, with support for payments via bank notes, cards, and Apple Pay. These machines allow users to choose their travel class, input journey start and end points, and specify any special requirements.Train journeys are designed to be swift and efficient. Once operational, the Abu Dhabi to Dubai route will take 57 minutes. Travel time to Fujairah will be around 100 minutes, and to Ruwais, approximately 70 minutes. The trains are expected to run at speeds of up to 200 km/h.Two types of trains will operate on the network. Chinese-manufactured CRC cabins will offer 365 seats, while Spanish CAF cabins will provide 369 seats. Though both models support the same class structure, slight design variations will differentiate the two interiors.The railway service is also making efforts to create a seamless and branded customer experience. Train drivers will wear grey and black uniforms, while station and train hosts will don cream and red uniforms.As excitement builds for Etihad Rail’s full-scale passenger operations, one detail still remains under wraps: ticket pricing. Additionally, specifics regarding last-mile connectivity options for passengers have yet to be disclosed.Nevertheless, the grand unveiling marks a significant step forward in the UAE’s long-term infrastructure and mobility plans, offering both residents and visitors an efficient and highly comfortable alternative to road transport.","Etihad Rail's passenger trains, launching in 2026, will connect Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 57 minutes.

Reminder for travelers: No power banks allowed on Emirates flights from October 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/reminder-for-travelers-no-power-banks-allowed-on-emirates-flights-from-october-1/articleshow/124229500.cms,"Emirates bans in-flight use of power banks from October 1, citing safety risks and industry incidents/Image: Emirates

What the new Emirates policy says





Here are the full details of the policy

Emirates customers may carry one power bank that is under 100 Watt Hours.

Power banks may not be used to charge any personal devices onboard.

Charging a power bank using the aircraft’s power supply is not permitted.

All power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available.

Power banks may not be placed in the overhead stowage bin onboard the aircraft and must now be placed in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of you.

Power banks are not permitted in checked luggage (existing rule).

Why Emirates is introducing this ban

Emirates responds to industry trends and battery related incidents

What passengers need to know before flying

Pre-charge all devices before arriving at the airport.

Use the aircraft’s in-seat charging points (where available) instead of personal power banks.

Verify the watt-hour rating on your power bank; it must be under 100 Wh and clearly marked.

Store the power bank in the seat pocket or under-seat bag, not in the overhead compartment.

Never place power banks in checked baggage.

Comply with all crew instructions regarding battery handling and safety.

FAQs:

Q. Can I still bring a power bank on my Emirates flight?

Q. Where should I store my power bank during the flight?

Q. Can I pack my power bank in my checked luggage?

Q. Will Emirates

provide alternatives to charge my devices in-flight?





Starting October 1, 2025, Emirates will strictly ban the use of power banks on all its flights. Passengers can still carry one power bank under 100Wh in their carry-on but are prohibited from using or charging it during the flight. Travelers are advised to follow the new rules closely to avoid inconvenience.Under the revised guidelines, passengers on Emirates flights will be allowed to carry only one power bank in their hand luggage, subject to specific safety requirements. However, using power banks onboard will no longer be permitted in any form.Passengers are advised to keep the power bank within reach, allowing cabin crew to respond quickly in the event of overheating or malfunction.The ban stems from safety assessments and growing global concern over lithium-ion battery hazards, particularly those associated with portable power banks. Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries, the core components of most power banks, are known to carry thermal runaway risks, a phenomenon where a battery’s temperature increases uncontrollably, potentially leading to fire, explosion, or toxic gas release.The underlying mechanism involves lithium ions moving through an electrolyte between two electrodes. If the battery is overcharged, physically damaged, or manufactured without proper safeguards, the electrolyte may overheat. In such cases, the battery may undergo thermal runaway, where heat production outpaces heat dissipation, triggering combustion or explosion.Emirates has clearly stated that the risk is particularly high with low-cost or poorly regulated power banks, which may lack essential built-in safety controls like temperature regulation or automatic shut-off mechanisms.Emirates is not alone in tightening its policy on portable batteries. Other major carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, EVA Air, China Airlines, and AirAsia, have already implemented restrictions on using power banks in-flight.The move follows high-profile safety incidents, including a January 2023 fire on an Air Busan Airbus A321, believed to be caused by a power bank. The incident left 27 passengers injured and led to renewed aviation-sector calls for stricter battery safety protocols.To ensure compliance and avoid last-minute issues at boarding, Emirates recommends that passengers take the following precautions:Passengers who fail to meet the guidelines risk having their power bank confiscated at the gate or denied boarding in extreme cases, as safety takes precedence.Yes, you can bring one power bank under 100Wh in your carry-on, but it must not be used or charged during the flight.Store it in your seat pocket or under the seat, placing it in overhead bins is not permitted.No, placing power banks in checked baggage is strictly prohibited for safety reasons.Yes, you may use the in-seat charging ports available on many Emirates aircraft, but not your own power bank.","Emirates bans in-flight use of power banks from October 1, citing safety risks and industry incidents.

New Visa Rules for Umrah 2025: Saudi Arabia makes hotel and transport pre-booking mandatory for visa approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-visa-rules-for-umrah-2025-saudi-arabia-makes-hotel-and-transport-pre-booking-mandatory-forvisaapproval/articleshow/124195721.cms,"Saudi tightens Umrah visa rules, Pilgrims must pre-book hotels and transport

Saudi Arabia’s new Umrah visa rules 2025 explained



Step-by-step process to apply for an Umrah visa in 2025



Book your accommodation only with licensed hotels or through a registered and verified operator. Use the official Nusuk Umrah/Nusuk Masar portal or an accredited local travel agency to make a secure and verified reservation; casual or unverified bookings may risk visa delays or outright rejection.

Arrange in-country transport (if required) and obtain confirmation. Many operators now include airport transfers and local transport in Umrah packages; keep receipts and booking references ready for the visa application.

Apply for the Umrah visa via the Nusuk portal or authorized channels. The Nusuk platform consolidates visa application, accommodation verification and permit scheduling; applicants should follow its instructions to avoid third-party bottlenecks.

Work with a vetted and trusted local operator if you prefer comprehensive package support. UAE-based tour operators are strongly advising pilgrims to book full travel packages (hotel + transport + expert guidance) to streamline approvals and ensure reliable, consistent on-ground services.

Essential travel tips for pilgrims visiting Makkah and Madinah

What to watch next





Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas, a rule intended to better manage pilgrim movement and prevent fraudulent accommodation offers. Umrah operators in the UAE are already urging travelers to complete these bookings preferably through Saudi’s official Nusuk platform or licensed agents before submitting visa applications.From this year, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and related authorities have tightened entry rules so that visa approval depends on proof of approved accommodation, typically hotel contracts verified through the Nusuk Masar / Nusuk Umrah platform and evidence of local transport arrangements. The move is part of a wider push to digitize and centralize Umrah services, requiring pilgrims to upload or link verified bookings before a visa is issued. Authorities say the change protects pilgrims from scams and improves crowd and accommodation management during busy periods.Expect slightly higher upfront planning costs because verified hotel and transport bookings must be made before visa issuance. Prices vary by season and hotel class; booking early often secures better rates and availability.If you’re flexible, choose off-peak slots and confirm cancellations/refund policies only verified, licensed contracts processed through Nusuk or accredited agents will reliably support visa approval. Operators also recommend allowing extra processing time during peak Islamic calendar dates.The rule tightens quality control and reduces fraud, but it also shifts pre-travel planning responsibility onto pilgrims and travel agents. For Saudi regulators, the change supports Vision 2030 goals to professionalize religious tourism and improve pilgrims’ safety and experience. For travelers, the key takeaway is simple: don’t apply for an Umrah visa without verified hotel and transport bookings, do it early and use Nusuk or licensed operators to avoid hiccups.",Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Google-parent Alphabet’s President of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Debbie Weinstein, has asked the European Union (EU) to simplify its complex and often conflicting regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology. Speaking at Bloomberg's Women, Money & Power conference in London, Weinstein stated that the large number of rules hinders Silicon Valley companies' ability to do business in the EU. Weinstein pointed out that the EU has issued approximately 100 internet laws since 2019. Criticising the regulatory environment of the region, Weinstein said:At the event, Weinstein mentioned a recent Google product,which generate responses to search queries. The company had delayed its release in Europe for several months due to concerns about compliance with various laws. According to Weinstein, Google has not yet made the feature available in France.she noted.Google has been under scrutiny from European regulators for years, facing repeated fines over antitrust issues and criticism of its privacy practices. More recently, tech companies have voiced concerns about the EU’s AI Act, which governs large language models like Google’s Gemini.Weinstein, who was promoted to lead Google’s UK office in December 2024, said she is focused on advocating for changes to EU rules, without providing specific details. She highlighted that most business leaders she talks to express “universal frustration” with the bloc’s regulation.she added.Apart from Google, other tech companies have also taken stances against EU regulation. Apple recently called for the repeal of EU antitrust laws, while Meta and Apple have delayed feature launches, citing strict rules.Unlike Google, Meta also refused to sign the EU’s AI code of practice. These moves have support from US President Donald Trump, who has criticised EU tech and antitrust regulations.

Importantly, Instant Checkout does not influence product ranking, ensuring fairness in recommendations. ChatGPT evaluates products based on availability, price, quality, and seller status to optimize the user experience.At the heart of Instant Checkout is the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open standard designed to enable AI agents, people, and businesses to collaborate on completing purchases. Co-developed with Stripe and leading merchants, the protocol is designed to be secure, easy to adopt, and platform-agnostic.When a user places an order through ChatGPT, the protocol securely transmits the purchase details to the merchant’s backend. The merchant then processes the payment, handles fulfillment, and provides customer support using their existing systems. Merchants using Stripe can enable agentic payments with just one line of code, while other payment processors can participate via ACP’s Shared Payment Token API or Delegated Payments Spec.OpenAI is open-sourcing the Agentic Commerce Protocol, allowing developers and merchants to build their own integrations. This move encourages innovation, enabling businesses to create seamless AI-driven commerce experiences across platforms and regions. Interested merchants can apply to make their products available for purchase through ChatGPT, unlocking a new channel to reach millions of users.The launch of Instant Checkout represents a significant leap toward agentic AI in commerce. Previously, AI agents could recommend products but could not complete transactions. Now, ChatGPT can act as a fully capable shopping assistant, bridging the gap between discovery and purchase.This innovation also positions OpenAI at the forefront of a competitive landscape. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft are developing similar AI-powered shopping tools, while Amazon faces potential disruption as chatbots redirect consumers away from traditional storefronts. By working directly with Shopify merchants and offering an open-source protocol, OpenAI is not only reshaping the online shopping experience but also redefining the power dynamics in ecommerce, putting AI agents at the center of the purchase journey.For users in the US, Instant Checkout is available for single-item purchases from Etsy sellers. Support for Shopify merchants and other retailers will roll out in phases. Users can simply ask ChatGPT for recommendations, tap “Buy” on supported products, and complete purchases within the chat interface.Merchants interested in enabling Instant Checkout can access OpenAI’s documentation and start building integrations today, opening their products to millions of ChatGPT users.With Instant Checkout and the Agentic Commerce Protocol, ChatGPT evolves from a conversational AI into a true shopping companion. Users enjoy effortless shopping, while merchants gain unprecedented access to a global audience—all without sacrificing control over their systems. This marks the beginning of agentic commerce, a new era where AI agents don’t just suggest what to buy—they help you buy it.","Instant Checkout allows users to go from product discovery to purchase with just a few taps. Over a million Shopify merchants, including Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, are expected to join soon. The Agentic Commerce Protocol ensures secure, efficient transactions while keeping merchants in control of fulfillment, payments, and customer relationships.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124257744,imgsize-57954,width-400,resizemode-4/openai-launches-instant-checkout-making-chatgpt-your-go-to-hub-for-ai-shopping-and-seamless-online-purchases.jpg"
