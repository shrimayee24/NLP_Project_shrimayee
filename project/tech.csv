it‚Äôs the most chronically online bullshit ever but basically this girl made a tiktok ranting ab her mom like snapping at her over ‚Äúpink tote lids‚Äù and it blew up and everyone is sharing their ‚Äúpink tote lid‚Äù moment except peoples moments keep getting more and more extreme

My pink tote lid moment was when my stepdad would tell me I was a loser with no friends & would call me lazy the second I left my room but then if I stayed out too late (mind u I didn‚Äôt have curfew!!) he would lock all the doors and unplug the garage door so I couldn‚Äôt get in ü§©

Part of a series on light and shadow, it is one of Magritte's most iconic works.The piece belonged to the late Mica Ertegun, a Romanian-born interior designer and arts patron. Ertegun, who passed away in 2023, was a significant figure in the American cultural scene and the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records. The sale marked a highlight in the autumn auction season, with the buyer‚Äôs identity remaining undisclosed.This achievement places Magritte among an elite group of artists whose works have surpassed the $100 million mark at auction, alongside figures such as Picasso and Warhol.

Now, she is kept awake every night by what sounds like the soundtrack of a low-budget horror movie at top volume.""The peaceful sounds of nature... have now been drowned out,"" Kim told AFP.""All we hear is this noise.""The campaign is the latest manifestation of steadily-declining ties between the two Koreas this year, which have also seen Pyongyang test ever more powerful missiles and bombard the South with trash-carrying balloons.Since July, North Korea has been broadcasting the noises for huge chunks of almost every day from loudspeakers along the border.The northern point of Ganghwa -- an island in the Han river estuary on the Yellow Sea -- is only about two kilometres (a mile) from the North.When AFP visited, the nighttime broadcast included what sounded like the screams of people dying on the battlefield, the crack of gunfire, bombs exploding, along with chilling music that started at 11:00 pm.In the almost pitch-black fields, sinister noises echoed as the stars in the clear night sky shone beautifully alongside the coastal road lights, creating a stark and unsettling contrast.North Korea has done propaganda broadcasts before, said 66-year-old villager Ahn Hyo-cheol, but they used to focus on criticising the South's leaders, or idealising the North.Now ""there were sounds like a wolf howling, and ghostly sounds"", he said.""It feels unpleasant and gives me chills. It really feels bizarre.""Ganghwa county councillor Park Heung-yeol said that the new broadcasts were ""not just regime propaganda -- it's genuinely intended to torment people"".TortureExperts said the new broadcasts almost meet the criteria for a torture campaign.""Almost every regime has used noise torture and sleep deprivation,"" Rory Cox, a historian at University of St Andrews, told AFP.""It is very common and leaves no physical scarring, therefore making it deniable.""Exposure to noise levels above 60 decibels at night increases the risk of sleep disorders, experts said, but AFP tracked levels of up to 80 decibels late at night on Ganghwa during a recent trip.""I find myself taking headache medicine almost all the time,"" An Mi-hee, 37, told AFP, adding that prolonged sleep deprivation due to the noise has also led to anxiety, eye pain, facial tremors and drowsiness.""Our kids can't sleep either, so they've developed mouth sores and are dozing off at school.""Distraught and desperate, An travelled to Seoul and got on her knees to beg lawmakers at the National Assembly to find a solution, breaking down in tears as she described the island's suffering.""It would actually be better if there were a flood, a fire, or even an earthquake, because those events have a clear recovery timeline,"" An said.""We have no idea if this will go on until the person in North Korea who gives the orders dies, or if it could be cut off at any moment. We just don't know.""'70s horror flick'The noise tormenting Ganghwa island residents appeared to be a rudimentary mix of clips from a sound library, typically common at any TV or radio broadcasters, audio experts told AFP.The sound effects are ""like something found in a South Korean horror film in the 70s and 80s,"" said sound engineer Hwang Kwon-ik.The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year declared Seoul his ""principal enemy"" and has ramped up weapons testing and built closer military ties with Russia.The isolated and impoverished North is known to be extremely sensitive about its citizens gaining access to South Korean pop culture.Some experts have suggested the latest broadcasts could be aimed at preventing North Korean soldiers from hearing the South's own propaganda broadcasts, which typically feature K-pop songs and international news.In August, just weeks after South Korea resumed K-pop broadcasts in response to Pyongyang floating trash-carrying balloons south, a North Korean soldier defected by crossing the heavily fortified border on foot.But Lee Su-yong, an audio production professor at the Dong-Ah Institute of Media and Arts, said ""if there is sound coming towards the North that you want to mask, then the sound (you use to cover it) must also be directed toward the North.""""It seems less about masking noise and more about inflicting pain on people in the South,"" he told AFP.Choi Hyoung-chan, a 60-year-old resident, said the South Korean government had failed to protect vulnerable civilians on the frontier.""They should come here and try to live with these sounds for just ten days,"" he told AFP, referring to officials in Seoul.""I doubt they could even endure a single day.""","North Korea is using loudspeakers to blare eerie sounds across the border.

Funnel-Web Spider: Australians urged to catch deadly funnel-web spiders for antivenom production,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australians-urged-to-catch-deadly-funnel-web-spiders-for-antivenom-production/articleshow/115481821.cms,"Australians urged to catch deadly funnel-web spiders for antivenom production (Picture credit: Australian Reptile Park)

Residents in Sydney and along Australia‚Äôs eastern coast are being asked to catch deadly funnel-web spiders to aid in the production of life-saving antivenom.The call, issued by the Australian Reptile Park (ARP), coincides with the spiders' breeding season when they are most active in homes and gardens.The funnel-web spider , known for its fast-acting venom, can kill a person in as little as 15 minutes. Despite its lethal potential, no deaths have been reported since the introduction of an antivenom in 1981.However, creating the antivenom requires approximately 150 spiders for just one vial, prompting ARP to seek public help.The Guardian quoted Emma Teni, a spider keeper at ARP, where she explained the urgency, ‚ÄúWith breeding season upon us and the weather creating ideal conditions, we rely on spider donations more than ever. Male funnel-web spiders have short lifespans, making public contributions vital for our venom supplies.‚ÄùThe park advises using a long-handled spoon to safely collect the spiders and their egg sacs in a sealed container. Egg sacs, which contain up to 200 spiderlings, provide a significant boost toantivenom production .The spiders are often found in damp, cool areas, including piles of laundry, shoes left outside, and garden debris. Their glossy black appearance and closely grouped eyes help distinguish them from similar species.Nicole Webber, whose life was saved by the antivenom in 1994, urged others to support the programme. ‚ÄúI reacted with anaphylactic shock very quickly after being bitten. Four rounds of that magic potion are why I‚Äôm still here,‚Äù she said, as reported by The Guardian.ARP remains the sole producer of funnel-web antivenom, ensuring its availability through public donations of spiders. Drop-off points have been established across the region for convenient spider collection.Residents are reminded to follow first-aid measures if bitten: apply a pressure bandage, remain calm, and seek immediate medical attention.","Residents in Sydney and along Australia‚Äôs eastern coast are being asked to catch deadly funnel-web spiders to aid in the production of life-saving antivenom.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Delhi air pollution: Air purifier buying guide - Don't make these 10 big mistakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/delhi-air-pollution-air-purifier-buying-guide-dont-make-these-10-big-mistakes/articleshow/115482587.cms,"Disclaimer: This is an AI-generated image

Getting the size wrong and ignoring room dimensions

Falling for marketing gimmicks and HEPA-like claims

Overlooking technical specifications and CADR ratings

Underestimating long-term costs and maintenance

Poor placement and setup mistakes

Inadequate filtration systems for Delhi's complex pollution

Missing air quality monitoring features

Neglecting filter maintenance schedules

Price-based decisions without research

FAQs: Air purifier buying guide

Do I need to run my air purifier 24/7?



How do I know when to replace the filters?

HEPA filters: Replace every 6-12 months

Replace every 6-12 months Carbon filters: Replace every 3-4 months

Replace every 3-4 months Pre-filters: Clean monthly and replace every 6 months However, if you live in a highly polluted area or have pets, you might need to replace filters more frequently.

Can one air purifier clean my entire home?

Will an air purifier help with allergies and asthma?

Do air purifiers remove smoke and cooking odours?

What's the difference between ""True HEPA"" and ""HEPA-type"" filters?

As Delhi-NCR battles dangerous air quality levels with AQI crossing 450, air purifiers have shifted from luxury to necessity. In the capital region's fight against toxic air, these devices offer a crucial defense for indoor spaces. However, the urgency to protect family health often leads to rushed purchases and expensive mistakes.Before you invest in an air purifier , it's essential to understand what makes these devices effective. From choosing the right size to understanding filtration technology, several factors determine whether your purchase will actually clean your air or just clean out your wallet. Here are the critical mistakes to avoid while buying an air purifier.The most common mistake someone could make is choosing an air purifier without considering room size. In the rush to combat pollution , many buyers pick units that are either too small to effectively clean their space or unnecessarily large for their rooms. A small unit will struggle continuously and never achieve optimal air quality, while an oversized one wastes energy and money. Before purchasing, measure your room's square footage and match it with the purifier's coverage area. For Delhi's heavily polluted air, experts recommend choosing a purifier rated for a slightly larger area than your actual room size to ensure effective cleaning.In Delhi's competitive air purifier market, many brands use clever marketing terms like ""HEPA-type"" or ""HEPA-style"" filters. These terms are red flags ‚Äì they indicate filters that don't meet true HEPA standards and can't effectively combat Delhi's dangerous PM2.5 pollutants. True HEPA filters, certified to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, are essential for Delhi's pollution levels. Don't compromise on this feature, even if it means paying a bit more.Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is crucial, yet often ignored in favor of brand names or attractive features. In Delhi's severe pollution, a higher CADR rating is essential for rapid air cleaning. Look for models with CADR ratings above 200 m¬≥/hour for medium-sized rooms. Remember, Delhi's air quality can deteriorate rapidly, and your purifier needs sufficient power to respond effectively.Many Delhi residents focus solely on the purchase price, forgetting the significant running costs of air purifiers. Factor in regular filter replacements (especially frequent during peak pollution months), electricity consumption, and maintenance costs. Calculate the total cost of ownership over at least two years, including peak pollution season requirements. Some cheaper models actually cost more in the long run due to frequent filter replacements and higher energy consumption.Even the most expensive air purifier won't perform effectively if poorly placed. Avoid tucking units into corners or behind furniture. Proper placement is critical - keep the purifier at least 2 feet away from walls, away from furniture obstacles, and in rooms where you spend most time. For Delhi homes, consider placing units near but not directly under air conditioning vents, as this helps with air circulation while avoiding direct interference with the purifier's airflow.Given Delhi's pollution levels, your air purifier needs to run continuously. Many buyers overlook noise ratings, leading to disturbed sleep and everyday discomfort. Look for units that operate below 50 decibels on normal settings, and ensure they have a quiet night mode. Test different speed settings before buying, as you'll be living with this sound around the clock during pollution seasons.Delhi's air contains a complex mix of pollutants - from PM2.5 to gases, smoke, and seasonal allergies. Single-filter systems often prove inadequate. Look for purifiers with multiple filtration stages: a pre-filter for larger particles, True HEPA filter for fine particles, and activated carbon for gases and odours. Some advanced models also offer anti-bacterial treatment, particularly useful during Delhi's smog seasons.Without real-time monitoring, you can't gauge your purifier's effectiveness as Delhi's air quality fluctuates. Choose models with PM2.5 indicators, air quality monitoring, and auto-mode functionality. Smart connectivity features, while not essential, can help you track air quality trends and adjust settings remotely.Many users continue using expired filters, severely compromising air purification. Delhi's high pollution levels mean filters may need more frequent replacement than manufacturer standards suggest. Keep track of filter life, maintain a replacement schedule, and clean pre-filters regularly. Consider keeping spare filters during peak pollution seasons when demands on the purifier are highest.Either choosing the cheapest option or assuming the most expensive model is best - both are mistakes common during Delhi's pollution emergencies. Set a realistic budget between ‚Çπ8,500 to ‚Çπ65,000, but focus on getting the right features for your specific needs. Consider the manufacturer's service network in Delhi-NCR, warranty terms, and verified user reviews from local users who understand the unique challenges of Delhi's air quality.Remember, an air purifier is a crucial health investment in Delhi's battle against air pollution. Take time to research and choose the right model rather than making panic purchases during severe pollution episodes. Combine your air purifier with proper room sealing, regular maintenance, and other protective measures for the best results in Delhi's challenging air quality conditions.For optimal air quality, yes. Air purifiers work best when operated continuously, as indoor air is constantly being contaminated by new particles. However, you can run them at lower speeds during quiet hours to reduce noise and energy consumption. Modern units are designed for continuous operation and typically consume minimal electricity - about 1/40th of what an air conditioner uses.Most modern air purifiers come with filter replacement indicators that light up when filters need changing. As a general rule:No, air purifiers are most effective in single, closed rooms. Their effectiveness decreases significantly in open floor plans or when trying to purify multiple rooms. For best results, place air purifiers in rooms where you spend the most time (like bedrooms and living rooms) and consider multiple units for larger homes.Yes, air purifiers with True HEPA filters can significantly help allergy and asthma sufferers by removing common triggers like pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and other airborne allergens. However, they should be used as part of a comprehensive approach that includes regular cleaning and controlling allergen sources.Air purifiers with both HEPA and activated carbon filters can effectively remove smoke particles and cooking odours. The HEPA filter captures the smoke particles, while the activated carbon filter absorbs odours and gases. However, for best results with strong cooking odours, ventilation (like range hoods or open windows) should be used in combination with air purifiers.True HEPA filters are certified to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, following strict testing standards. ""HEPA-type"" or ""HEPA-like"" filters are marketing terms for filters that don't meet these certification standards and may be significantly less effective. Always look for ""True HEPA"" certification when choosing an air purifier for the best performance.","Delhi-NCR battles dangerous air quality levels with AQI crossing 450.
