New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

During the past week, the tech industry witnessed several major developments. Alphabet made headlines with its largest-ever acquisition, agreeing to purchase cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion to bolster Google Cloud's security capabilities. Google also announced the Pixel 9a, a mid-range smartphone featuring the Tensor G4 chip and advanced AI capabilities, scheduled for release in April 2025. In gaming, Ubisoft celebrated a successful launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which attracted 2 million players within two days of its March 20th release. Meanwhile, regulatory challenges continued as the EU took enforcement action against Google and Apple for alleged violations of the Digital Markets Act, and more. Here are all the top tech news of the week.Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's largest-ever acquisition, significantly surpassing its previous record purchase of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012.The all-cash deal aims to strengthen Google Cloud's security capabilities amid growing demand for cloud computing services driven by the AI boom. Five-year-old Wiz, founded by four friends who met in the Israeli army and currently headquartered in New York, is on track to generate $1 billion in revenue this year.The acquisition faces potential regulatory scrutiny, particularly given Google's ongoing antitrust battles with the U.S. Justice Department over its search and advertising businesses, though analysts suggest both companies likely see a path to approval under the Trump administration. If approved, the deal is expected to close in 2026.The Google Pixel 9a is a new mid-range smartphone priced at Rs 49,900, featuring Google's Tensor G4 chip and a sleek redesign with a 6.3-inch Actua display that's 35% brighter than its predecessor with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The phone comes in four colors: Peony , new Iris, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Camera upgrades include a dual rear system with a 48MP main camera, 13MP ultrawide, and first-time Macro Focus for the A-series. AI features include Add Me, Best Take, Magic Editor with Auto Frame, and Gemini built-in with Gemini Nano, making it the only sub-$500 phone with this capability. The Pixel 9a boasts over 30 hours of battery life (up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver), seven years of OS updates, IP68 water and dust resistance, and enhanced security features. Additional features include Circle to Search, Pixel Studio , Call Assist, and family-focused tools like Google Family Link, School Time, and the new Google Wallet for kids rolling out in select countries.The phone will be available beginning in April 2025.Assassin's Creed Shadows has reached 2 million players within two days of its March 20th release, according to Ubisoft's announcement on social media. The company stated that this milestone surpasses the launch performance of both Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey. While Ubisoft hasn't confirmed specific sales figures, the game is currently the top-selling title on Steam with nearly 59,000 concurrent players at the time of reporting, approaching Odyssey 's all-time Steam peak of 62,069 players.The game's success is particularly significant for Ubisoft following several high-profile commercial disappointments, including Star Wars Outlaws, and amid reports that the founding Guillemot family is exploring buyout talks with Tencent. Despite facing controversies in Japan that prompted a day-one patch to address concerns about in-game temples and shrines, Assassin's Creed Shadows has received ""very positive"" user reviews on Steam, with 81% of over 6,000 reviews marked as positive. The game is available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Ubisoft+, Amazon Luna, and Mac , with an iPad version expected in the future.The European Commission has taken enforcement action against Google and Apple for allegedly violating the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), despite potential retaliation from the Trump administration.In its preliminary findings announced on March 19, the Commission accused Google's search engine of unfairly prioritizing Alphabet's own services over competitors and preventing app developers on Google Play from directing consumers to better offers elsewhere. Apple faces requirements to make its operating systems compatible with competitors' devices and provide a clear methodology for responding to app developers' requests to access its systems.Violations of the DMA could result in fines of up to 10% of worldwide revenue (20% for repeat offenders), potentially reaching nearly $80 billion based on Apple's 2024 revenue. Apple criticized the decision as ""red tape"" that would slow innovation, while Google argued the changes would make it harder for users to find what they're looking for.Elon Musk 's X (formerly Twitter) has filed a lawsuit against the Indian government, alleging that the Ministry of Information Technology is unlawfully expanding its censorship powers. The lawsuit claims that the government has created a parallel content removal system that bypasses legal safeguards protecting free speech by allowing countless officials to issue removal orders without proper oversight.X argues this violates constitutional rights to equality and freedom of expression. The case represents the latest conflict between X and Indian authorities over content moderation, dating back to disputes in 2021 regarding farmers' protests. This legal battle comes at a significant time as Musk reportedly prepares to launch his other ventures—Starlink and Tesla—in India, with the Karnataka High Court scheduled to continue hearing arguments on March 27.OpenAI and Meta Platforms have been holding separate discussions with India's Reliance Industries about potential partnerships to expand their AI offerings in the country, according to a report by The Information.One possibility being discussed involves a relationship between Reliance Jio and OpenAI to distribute ChatGPT, potentially at a reduced subscription price. Reliance has also discussed selling OpenAI's models to its enterprise customers through an API and hosting both Meta and OpenAI models locally in a planned three-gigawatt data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which Reliance claims will be the world's largest. This local hosting would allow customer data to remain within India. Meta declined to comment on the report, while OpenAI and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The original creator of the Pebble smartwatch, Eric Migicovsky, is preparing to release two new smartwatches through his company Core Devices. The first model, called the Core 2 Duo, will cost $149 and is expected to ship in July. It features the same black-and-white e-paper display as the original Pebble 2 and even uses leftover frames from the old Pebble designs. Despite being based on 8-year-old technology, the watch benefits from advances in efficiency, offering over 30 days of battery life compared to the original's seven days, and includes a new speaker for AI assistant interactions. Only about 10,000 units will be available.The second model, the Core Time 2, will ship in December for $225 and adds a touchscreen to the classic Pebble design while maintaining the signature buttons, long battery life, and customization features. Both watches will run the newly open-sourced Pebble operating system. Migicovsky notes that while iPhone compatibility remains challenging, Android integration is more straightforward. He emphasizes that his goal isn't to sell millions of units but rather ""to make something I really want.""","Google-parent company, Alphabet, is acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's largest-ever acquisition.

Quoting the post, Musk added, ""I do drift off into thinking about Mars at times.""Musk has frequently spoken about his vision for Mars exploration, with SpaceX actively developing its Starship rocket, designed to carry humans to Mars and beyond.

Mark Henry announces his Legends contract with WWE



“I got my camera going. And I’m videoing everybody. I’m videoing you all. It is with a lot of love and a lot of thought that’s went behind this. I bought into a wrestling company called All Caribbean, and I’m one of the owners. But today, I’m announcing that just about 30 minutes ago, I signed a nostalgia deal with WWE.”

Mark Henry , a former powerlifter, Olympic weightlifter, and retired professional wrestler has recently signed with the WWE under a Legends (or Nostalgia) contract. It was signed late last month, as revealed by Henry himself. WWE now has the rights to the wrestler’s likeness, and can now be in video games, t-shirts, toys, and more. Many WWE alumni and Hall of Famers are also currently signed under the Legends/ Nostalgia contract. Mark Henry is a two-time Olympian, who joined the WWE in 1996, which was still known as the WWF back then. He retired from his role as a professional wrestler in 2017 after WrestleMania 33 and took on the role of a backstage producer/mentor. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018 and went on to make occasional appearances inside the ring from time to time.His contract ended in 2021, after which he joined the AEW as a commentator and coach. But that ended after three years in 2024. And now he is back with the WWE once more and has signed a Nostalgia contract with the company, which gives it the authority to produce and sell merch of the World's Strongest Man , use him as an avatar in video games, and more.Recently, Mark Henry was at Sweet Chin Disco in Belfast. There was a sold-out crowd of fans for the Hall of Famer, and it presented the perfect opportunity for him to make the announcement of having signed the Legends contract with the company.Fans could soon have action figures of the World's Strongest Man on their shelves.

Paul Heyman’s loyalty in question?

Triple Threat match confirmed: Reigns vs. Punk vs. Rollins

On the recent episode of SmackDown, a verbal confrontation quickly escalated into a physical brawl that involved Roman Reigns , CM Punk, and Seth Rollins. Not much to our surprise, the three wrestlers have been feuding since things went bizarre at the Men’s Royal Rumble early this year. With WWE ’s official announcement to feature a Triple Threat match between Reigns, Punk, and Rollins, it is already the talk of the town. There have been quite a few speculations surrounding Reigns’ special counsel, Paul Heyman, as fans have been speculating on his loyalty towards the Tribal Chief after Punk's remarks on the March 21 episode of SmackDown. Much to our surprise, Heyman’s cryptic post might have cleared a few doubts.After the tense confrontation between Reigns, Punk, and Rollins, something that seemed off to the fans was Punk’s words to Heyman before the situation escalated further to the extent that security had to intervene to eliminate the chaos. Punk recalled a past favor owed by Heyman, suggesting that he had “delivered Roman on a silver platter.” This particular remark by Punk indeed ignited speculations questioning Heyman’s allegiance with the Tribal Chief.As the speculations are swirling around, Heyman found the best way to tease yet clarify something he is being doubted about. Taking to his X account, Heyman posted a status with a private jet visual and thanked the fans in Bologna. He stated, “Thank you Bologna, Your #TribalChief and his humble #Wiseman appreciate your love, respect, admiration, adulation, affirmation and worship!” Well, this message might not be easy to decode considering Heyman’s cunning approaches he is widely known for, but we do believe being beside the Tribal Chief might be the best choice, and Heyman is standing on it.WWE announcing a Triple Threat match for WrestleMania 41 between Reigns, Rollins, and Punk has already shaken the wrestling world. From a massive power shift to Punk revealing more secrets, it is hard to predict what the upcoming days have in store for us, but stay tuned to get the latest updates on WWE.Also Read: 5 times when Roman Reigns trolled top superstars on the mic","Roman Reigns, CM Punk, and Seth Rollins have been feuding since the Men’s Royal Rumble early this year.

Ben Stiller extends a warm invite to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce

A star-studded affair at Madison Square Garden

Record-Breaking Signings, March Madness Mayhem & A Severance Waffle Party with Ben Stiller | Ep 130

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and global music sensation Taylor Swift may soon be adding NBA courtside seats to their list of high-profile outings. With the NFL offseason in full swing, Kelce has plenty of time to explore other sports, and it looks like a special invitation from Hollywood megastar Ben Stiller could make a trip to Madison Square Garden a reality.Athletes attending NBA games is nothing new, and Kelce, given his celebrity status, would have no trouble securing courtside seats. However, this time, the invite comes with a personal touch—from a passionate New York Knicks fan and award-winning actor-director himself, Ben Stiller.During a guest appearance on the New Heights podcast, hosted by Travis and Jason Kelce, Stiller—who is known for hit films like Zoolander and the critically acclaimed TV series Severance—shared his enthusiasm for the Knicks and his past experiences watching games with Taylor Swift.This prompted Kelce to suggest that it might be time for another visit. ""Maybe we can get Taylor to another Knicks game,"" Kelce said, hinting at a possible return to Madison Square Garden alongside Swift.Never one to miss a comedic moment, Stiller responded with his signature wit, playfully joking about the idea of Kelce and Swift needing help getting into the venue. ""Yeah, this is the time,"" Stiller said. ""You should definitely come though. I can hook that up. I’m sure you would need help getting in.""If Kelce and Swift accept the offer, their presence at Madison Square Garden will undoubtedly make waves. Swift’s influence on sports viewership has already been evident during the NFL season, with Chiefs games seeing a significant ratings boost whenever she was in attendance.At a Knicks game, the energy would likely be no different. Just as Arrowhead Stadium erupts when she’s there supporting Kelce, MSG’s courtside crowd would be buzzing with excitement if Swift made an appearance.Also Read: Through sunshine and rain: Travis Kelce goes all out to support Taylor Swift as she navigates personal challenges Whether or not Kelce and Swift take Stiller up on his offer remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: if they do, it’ll be one of the biggest celebrity sightings of the NBA season.","Ben Stiller extends a warm invite to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's quiet retreat in Big Sky, Montana

After a turbulent post-Super Bowl period, Kansas City Chiefs' star Travis Kelce and music icon Taylor Swift have re-emerged in the public eye—this time, in the serene mountains of Big Sky, Montana. The couple, who had been laying low following the Super Bowl fallout, chose the scenic getaway to enjoy some peace away from the spotlight.According to Deuxmoi, an insider source known for celebrity scoops, the pair were spotted making the most of Montana’s world-class ski resorts. “The couple was recently spotted enjoying a getaway in Big Sky, Montana, a popular destination for its stunning scenery and world-class skiing,” the outlet reported.Kelce and Swift have been noticeably absent from public outings in recent weeks. This quiet period followed a controversial Super Bowl moment, where Kelce had a lackluster performance on the field, and Swift faced an unexpected wave of boos from Philadelphia Eagles fans. Reports suggested that their representatives advised them to step back from the limelight to avoid further scrutiny. But with time away from the public gaze, it seems the couple has found a way to reset.During their Montana escape, the duo reportedly enjoyed the pristine slopes, indulging in the winter activities the area is known for.
