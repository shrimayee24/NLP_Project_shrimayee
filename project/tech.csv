Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu on Arattai app dropping out of top 100 list: ‘I literally told our employees…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-on-arattai-app-dropping-out-of-top-100-list-i-literally-told-our-employees/articleshow/125278324.cms,"Vembu: Zoho has long-term strategy









Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest. The only thing that keeps a monopolist honest is competition,” he said.While talking about end-to-end encryption of chats on Arattai, Vembu noted that the encryption feature has been implemented, however, it will take some more time for the updates to take effect.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list.

""per agent""

""Dwarkesh Podcast""

“Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work.

The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”

“All the stuff we built underneath M365 still is going to be very relevant. You need some place to store it, some place to do archival, some place to do discovery, some place to manage all of these activities, even if you're an AI agent,""

“grow faster than the number of users.”

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Read what Satya Nadella said about adjsuting software business pricing model





“Don't think of the tool as the end thing. What is the entire substrate underneath that tool that humans use, and that entire substrate is the bootstrap for the AI agent as well, because the AI agent needs a computer that's kind of one. So in fact, that's why I think we're going to have essentially an end-user computing infrastructure business, which I think is going to just keep growing because guess what, it's going to grow faster than the number of users.

So in fact, that's kind of one of the other questions people asked me is ‘hey, what happens to the per-user business?’ At least the early signs may be the way to think about the per user business is not just per user, it's per agent, and if you sort of say it's per user and per agent, the key is what's the stuff to provision for every agent, a computer, a set of security things around it, an identity around it and all those things are observability and so on are the management layers. And that's I think is going to get baked into that.”

What Satya Nadella said about how AI agents is being integrated in Microsoft’s tools





“Well, let's take even this little thing we built called

Excel Agent

. Excel Agent is not a UI-level wrapper in this case because we have all the IPs from the GPT family. We are taking that and putting it into the core middle tier of the office system. I need to see both, not just see the pixels; I need to be able to see. Oh. I got that formula wrong, and I need to understand that. So I'm giving it essentially a markdown to teach it the skills of what it means to be a sophisticated Excel user. That's the type of stuff that will get built by everybody. So even for the model companies, they're allowed to compete, right? So if their price stuff high, guess what if I'm a builder of a tool like this? I'll substitute you. And so as long as there's competition where there's multiple models and there's an open source check, there is enough room here to go build value on top of models.”

“Don't worry about the Excel integration. After all Excel was built as a tool for analyst. So whoever is this AI, that is an analyst.”

“I'm building an analyst as essentially an AI agent, which happens to come with an a priori knowledge of how to use all of these analytical tools,”





Microsoft's software business is planning to adjust its pricing model. Satya Nadella , the software giant’s CEO, has revealed the company is shifting from chargingtoas artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the, Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said:The shift reflects a broader industry transformation as companies reconsider how to charge customers, adopting agentic AI systems that run software rather than simply being powered by it. Nadella noted Microsoft's services, including the Microsoft 365 suite, which already earns $100 billion in revenue per year, would serve as the core workspace for AI agents.Nadella said. He also suggested that this new infrastructure business wouldEarlier this year, Microsoft introduced a pay-as-you-go pricing model for its AI agents. The metered system sits on top of a free Copilot chat experience for Microsoft 365 users, allowing companies to pay based on the work their AI agents perform.Other tech companies, such as Anthropic, also bill customers based on usage, charging for their Claude models per million tokens processed.Google uses a comparable pay-as-you-go approach for its Gemini API.Discussing how Microsoft is planning to adjust the pricing models of its software business, Nadella noted:At the podcast, Nadella explained:Nadella highlighted:he added.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company is shifting from charging to charging to support AI systems.

Retail experience and purchase process at launch









Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE have jointly introduced iPhone Pocket, a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items. The product is described as a “piece of cloth” reimagined as a flexible pocket: its ribbed, open-knit fabric expands to enclose a device and lets users glimpse the display when stretched. iPhone Pocket is available in two strap lengths and multiple colours, and Apple frames it as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design and personal style. The launch is positioned as both a fashion collaboration and a product engineered for universal fit and everyday utility.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio. Crafted in Japan, the textile draws inspiration from the brand’s iconic pleats and is intended to function as an additional, wearable pocket for iPhone and other “pocketable items” such as AirPods. The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed.Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio.

The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed. Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.According to Apple, the iPhone Pocket is sized and structured to fit any iPhone model as well as small everyday items. The open knit expands to accommodate slightly bulkier contents and lets users peek at the iPhone display without removing the phone fully. Apple highlights multiple ways to use the accessory: handheld, attached to a bag, or worn on the body. The product is positioned as a fashion accessory as much as a utility item, emphasising styling and personal expression alongside practical carrying.Apple’s Newsroom states the iPhone Pocket was crafted in Japan and that its development and design unfolded through collaboration between ISSEY MIYAKE’s research and development teams and Apple Design Studio. The piece references ISSEY MIYAKE’s longstanding practice of pleating and textile innovation as the inspiration for the accessory’s knit structure. Apple quotes design leads from both organisations to underline the shared approach to simplicity, craftsmanship and adaptability.Apple positions iPhone Pocket as both fashion and function: the open knit and colour palette were explicitly selected to mix and match with iPhone finishes and to let users create personal combinations. Apple images show Pocket paired with iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air models in complementary colours. Practical use cases emphasised by Apple include carrying the iPhone and small items together, wearing the Pocket across the body for hands-free use, and tying it to other bags or accessories. Retail staff will assist customers in stores in selecting strap length and colour combinations.Apple’s announcement emphasises the crafted textile quality and the 3D-knitted construction, but does not publish a formal care guide in the Newsroom piece. Because iPhone Pocket is a textile accessory made in Japan using ISSEY MIYAKE’s knit techniques, consumers should expect typical fabric care considerations gentle handling, avoiding sharp objects, and following any care instructions included in product packaging or on Apple’s online product pages after purchase. For definitive care and warranty details, customers should consult Apple’s product page or in-store specialists at launch.Apple frames iPhone Pocket as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design language and expands how users carry and style their devices. The product is intended to sit alongside Apple’s existing accessory portfolio rather than replace protective cases: it emphasises wearability, textile design, and aesthetic pairing. Apple highlights the accessory’s ability to carry other small items (for example, AirPods) and to visually coordinate with iPhone finishes.Apple’s announcement lists the specific Apple Store locations where iPhone Pocket will be available at launch and notes that both online and in-store purchase options will be offered beginning November 14, 2025. Apple Specialists will help customers mix and match lengths and colours with their iPhone and demonstrate styling options. Customers outside the initial launch markets should monitor apple.com for availability updates.","iPhone Pocket is a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items.

Tower’s spectacular features





Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road that will carry Shah Rukh Khan ’s name and a life-size statue of the star at its entrance. The project, unveiled at a Mumbai event with Danube founder Rizwan Sajan and Shah Rukh Khan, is positioned as a landmark commercial address and is expected to be completed in the next 3–4 years.Shahrukhz (styled as Shahrukhz by Danube) is being promoted as a premium commercial and lifestyle tower on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai’s main business artery. Reports list it as a 55–56 storey development with more than one million sq ft of built-up space, a helipad, over 40 amenities (sky pool, business lounges, valet, etc.), and a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose at the entrance. The builder's marketing and press coverage place the finish date around 2029, a roughly three-to-four-year timeline.The newly unveiled skyscraper is more than just a name; it’s a massive commercial development positioned at a prime location. The building sits directly on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai's main arterial corridor. The project carries a gross saleable value of approximately ₹4,000 crore (over $480 million) and will span more than 1 million square feet of built-up space.Marketed as a premium, Grade-A commercial destination, the tower stands 55 or 56 storeys tall.This landmark development is intended to be affordable for new businesses in Dubai, with commercial units starting at around $460,000. Construction is underway, and the developers are targeting a completion date by the second quarter of 2029.Danube Group is one of the UAE’s most recognisable home-grown business success stories, and the company behind the newly announced Shahrukhz tower. The group was founded in 1993 by Rizwan Sajan, an Indian-origin entrepreneur who arrived in Dubai with modest beginnings and grew a small trading shop into a multi-industry powerhouse.Over three decades, Sajan expanded Danube from a building-materials supplier into a diversified conglomerate with operations across the Middle East and Asia. His leadership style is often described as hands-on, ambitious and deeply relationship-driven, which has helped Danube build long-standing trust among suppliers, customers and partners.Today, Danube Group operates several major verticals, including building materials, home interiors, hospitality, façade systems and real estate but its most high-profile public face is Danube Properties, the development arm behind this new Shah Rukh Khan-named tower. Because the company originally started in building materials, Danube has an unusually deep supply-chain advantage in construction, allowing it to manage cost, quality and delivery with tighter control than many competitors.The grand launch event took place not in Dubai, but in Mumbai, hosted by the developers to appeal to Indian investors. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan graced the stage, alongside Danube Chairman Rizwan Sajan and filmmaker Farah Khan. The actor became visibly emotional while reflecting on the milestone, noting that his late mother would have been ""very happy"" about the honour. He shared a personal connection, expressing pride that he could tell his children, ""Papa's name is written here, this is Papa's building. ""In classic SRK style, he entertained the audience by recreating his iconic open-arm pose, performing the ""Don walk,"" and delivering his famous 'Om Shanti Om' dialogue. He also joked about his rare public appearances, quipping, ""I’ve become like the Eid moon. I am rarely seen, but when I appear, I look good."" Khan revealed that he was drawn to the project because it resonated with the idea of supporting people who come to a city with dreams of building their businesses and lives.The ""Shahrukhz by Danube"" tower is designed to be a unique experience, blending luxury commercial space with a tourist attraction dedicated to the star. It will boast more than 40 premium amenities for its occupants. The most distinctive feature will be a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose, located prominently at the entrance.The developers envision this entrance becoming a must-visit tourist destination, much like fans flock outside SRK's Mumbai residence, Mannat. Furthermore, the building’s cutting-edge design includes a helipad and is even expected to feature an air taxi station, a nod to Dubai’s futuristic transit plans. Danube Properties has confirmed that the name ""Shahrukhz"" is guaranteed to remain with this specific tower in perpetuity.","Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road.

Medical device maker wins multi-year patent fight over heart rate technology





A federal jury in California delivered a major blow to Apple , ordering the Cupertino giant to pay medical device maker Masimo Corporation $634 million for infringing patents related to blood oxygen monitoring technology in Apple Watches. The jury found that Apple Watch's workout mode and heart rate notification features violated Masimo's pulse-oximetry patent rights, according to Reuters. The verdict covers approximately 43 million watches sold between 2020 and 2022, representing one of the largest patent awards in the Central District of California involving consumer technology.Masimo called the decision ""a significant win in our ongoing efforts to protect our innovations and intellectual property."" The company had sought royalties ranging from $634 million to $749 million, while Apple argued damages should be limited to between $3 million and $6 million.The dispute centers on whether Apple misappropriated medical-grade monitoring technology for consumer wearables. A key issue was whether the Apple Watch qualifies as a ""patient monitor"" under Masimo's patent—a designation Apple vigorously contested, arguing the term applies only to continuous clinical monitoring devices.Apple plans to appeal, stating the patent ""expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago,"" Reuters reported. The company noted that Masimo has ""sued Apple in multiple courts and asserted over 25 patents, the majority of which have been found to be invalid.""The legal fight has already impacted Apple's products. The U.S. International Trade Commission banned imports of certain Apple Watch models in 2023 after finding patent infringement, forcing Apple to remove blood oxygen monitoring features. Apple later introduced a redesigned version.This case is part of a broader dispute that includes a separate trade-secrets lawsuit that ended in mistrial and Apple's successful $250 countersuit against Masimo over design patents.","Medical device maker wins multi-year patent fight over heart rate technology.

When and how to watch the Northern Lights





What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",German court rules OpenAI violated copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others.

""I've been mobilized, I'm heading to Chasiv Yar,"" says what appears to be a young Ukrainian soldier through floods of tears in the back of a military vehicle. ""Help me, I don't want to die. I'm only 23. Please help me.""A reverse image search using screenshots reveals that the video has been posted hundreds of times on social media, racking up millions of views and pushing the message that Ukraine is drafting young men against their will to replace losses on the battlefield amid the continuing Russian invasion.DW found the video shared across various social media platforms in a dozen different languages, including English, German, French, Italian, Spanishand Russian. The most viral instance of the video appeared on a Hungarian X account, where it had been viewed at least 1.8 million times.Claim: ""Ukrainian men as young as 23 are being conscripted and sent to the front""However, not only is the video factually incorrect (the minimum conscription age in Ukraine was lowered from 27 to 25 in April 2024, but never to 23), but it is also fake, to be precise: it was generated by artificial intelligence.This is clear from visual inaccuracies in the video, such as the poorly-fitting helmet, which doesn't match standard Ukrainian military equipment.Not only that, a basic facial recognition searchreveals that the face is actually that of Vladimir Yuryevich Ivanov, a young Russian streamer from St. Petersburg who uses the online pseudonym Kussia88.On its own, ""kussia"" (pronounced ""kasha"") means ""porridge"" in Russian (каша). But the use of ""88"" (neo-Nazi code for ""Heil Hitler"") and the Latin transcription using a double ""SS"" are no coincidence.Nor is the use of the letters ""IA"". In international neo-Nazi circles, ""IA"" would be understood to mean ""14"" — a code referring to the ""14 words""propagated by American neo-Nazi David Lane: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""The slogans have served as a rallying cry for militant white nationalists internationally.Indeed, the numbers 1488 and 8814 appear in the URL and profile description of Ivanov's accounts on TikTok and Boosty(a Russian platform that enables content creators to earn regular income through subscriptions and donations from their community).According to several Reddit chats, Ivanov's Twitch account, which has over 1.3 million followers, has been subject to at least one temporary ban in recent months.The AI video using Ivanov's face seems to have first appeared on the now-deleted TikTok channel @fantomoko, along with dozens of other similar AI clips, all supposedly depicting Ukrainian soldiers crying in military vehicles.Most only seem to have been viewed a few thousand times, but two had over 800,000 views, one had over 1.5 million views and the most popular had over 2.1 million. Some of the videos even featured the watermark ""Sora,"" OpenAI's image generator.Another face that appears regularly on clips posted by the @fantomoko account was that of Aleksei Gubanov, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gubanov, who now lives in New York, told DW that he has ""absolutely no connection"" to the clips. ""All of them were created by someone using AI and without my consent or involvement.""He added he had warned his audience ""that someone is deliberately trying to stir public outrage by creating this kind of content. Those videos play directly into Russian propaganda narratives and gain millions of views. To be absolutely clear — I did not create, approve, or participate in any of those videos, and I strongly condemn the use of AI-generated fake media for manipulation or propaganda.""DW also reached out to Ivanov but had not received a response by the time of publication. According to the Ukrainian database ""Stars about war,"" which documents celebrities' positions on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ivanov does not typically comment on the war and was once reprimanded by the Russian authorities for mocking the children of mobilized soldiers. After that, he reportedly apologized in a video shot against the background of a Russian flag, and stated that Crimea is Russian.Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""Screenshot of Russian streamer Ivanov (aka Kussia88) posting a comment in Russian that translates as: ""The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train.""'The Twitter crowd have finally got on board the hype train,' responds Kussia, sarcastically.Image: TelegramOn his Telegram channel, he responded to suggestions that he was involved with the AI videos and that he is a ""pro-Putin Nazi"" sarcastically, saying: ""The Twitter crowd have finally learned what 'delivery' means"" — Russian Twitch slang effectively meaning: ""They've finally got on board the hype train.""Either way, regardless of whether Ivanov was actively involved in their creation or not, and regardless of his views, the videos going viral remain entirely fake.","A video showing young Ukrainian soldiers crying has gone viral on social media.

Will Dubai’s 20-minute city vision melt under extreme summer heat? Is there a plan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-dubais-20-minute-city-vision-melt-under-extreme-summer-heat-is-there-a-plan/articleshow/125317772.cms,"Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat (Representative Image)





How Expo City is tackling the heat



In winter: Encouraging walking through interactive, engaging spaces

In summer: Introducing climate-adapted solutions such as:



Climate-responsive urban design such as enclosed cool spaces Shaded walking routes Smart mobility hubs for bicycles and e-scooters Electric vehicles to support inclusive and multi-modal mobility



Don’t forget the old neighborhoods



Sustaining the vision: Making 20-minute cities work in the real world

Reduced traffic congestion

Improved quality of life

Lower carbon emissions

Greater walkability and livability





Dubai is pushing forward with its ambitious goal of building “20-minute cities”: neighborhoods where residents can access 80% of their daily needs, such as work, school, shops, and parks, within a 20-minute walk, bike ride, or public transport trip. This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat.

Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone





JOHANNESBURG: Google will pay more than $40 million to support South African news media, many of them floundering in a digital age, the country's competition authority said Thursday.Tech giants, including TikTok, X and Facebook , have come under fire for anti-trust practices that the watchdog says hurt local media by limiting their ability to distribute and profit from their digital content.In February, the Competition Commission had recommended that Google pay up to $27 million a year for five years, following a 16-month investigation that found Google searches favoured international news over local outlets.But the California-based company ultimately agreed to a 688 million-rand ($40.4-million) funding package, the commission said Thursday as it released its final report.Under the agreement, $4 million will go to national publishers and broadcasters over five years for content on Google News , while $2.6 million will be allocated annually to support AI innovation.Community and small media outlets will receive $2.2 million over three years to support digital transformation.""Google will also introduce new user tools to prioritise local news sources, provide technical assistance to improve website performance, share enhanced audience data,"" the commission said, adding that YouTube had also agreed to support monetisation.The platforms also committed to removing algorithmic bias favouring foreign outlets, it said.Similar funding deals have been reached in countries including Taiwan, Canada, Australia and the United States in the face of mounting pressure from governments to introduce regulations requiring such arrangements.Chinese social media platform TikTok had meanwhile agreed to provide new tools, including allowing media to insert links within videos to monetise off-platform content.Social media platform X, owned by South African-born billionaire Elon Musk , did not reach a settlement and has been ordered to make all monetisation programmes available to local publishers and to provide training workshops.The directive can be appealed, the commission said.","Google will pay more than $40 million to support South African news media.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it good for the ocean’s ecosystem?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-the-uae-deliberately-sank-3-ships-is-it-good-for-the-oceans-ecosystem/articleshow/125237316.cms,"Inchcape 1, sunk off Al Aqah in 2001, has transformed into a thriving marine habitat, attracting divers with its diverse marine life/ Image: vipdivingdubai





The Concept: Artificial reefs for marine life





Inchcape 1: A Diver’s haven in Al Aqah





Inchcape 2: A thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A marine wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological balance and marine conservation

Khaleej Times





Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it bad for the ocIn a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.ean’s ecosystem?","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125237379,imgsize-391145,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-sunked-ship-inchape-1-dive-site.jpg"

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets. To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125131123,imgsize-132093,width-400,resizemode-4/enigmatic-legal-inquiry.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

What may be behind Tesla embracing Apple Car Play







Tesla may reportedly be planning to do what the company has not done so far. According to a report by Bloomberg, Tesla is working to add support for Apple CarPlay in its vehicles. This is something that CEO Elon Musk is said to be resisting since 10-plus years. iPhone maker has reportedly started testing the capability internally and could be close to releasing it publicly in the next few months. What makes this important is that despite huge demand from iPhone users, Tesla has never allowed phone mirroring in its cars.The EV maker's argument for both Google's Android Auto and Apple Car Play is same -- that Tesla can provide a better, more integrated software experience than a smartphone. Tesla vehicles rely on company's own infotainment software system, which integrates vehicle functions, navigation, music, web browsing, and more.According to the report, Tesla's adoption of ‌CarPlay‌ will involve the feature operating ""within a window inside its broader interface,"" rather than being a full-screen experience like it is in most vehicles. Report also said that Tesla's implementation will be the standard version of wireless ‌CarPlay‌, rather than the next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ Ultra that started rolling out earlier this year.Essential components, such as navigation, will continue to run on the familiar Tesla systems.This will reportedly be to ensure that the functionality of the linked assistance systems, including the ‘Full Self Driving Software’.So what is it that has led to this change. Analysts term fall in Tesla sales as one of the reasons. The absence of Apple CarPlay is reportedly often a dealbreaker for many car shoppers. According to a study conducted by management consultancy McKinsey in 2024, the unavailability of Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto, would be a deal breaker for 30 per cent of potential buyers when choosing their electric car.Bloomberg reports that adopting CarPlay, as outlandish as it may seem, could be part of a broader strategy to get people interested again in Tesla’s cars.For Apple, analysts see this as a milestone in its automotive activities. For, Tesla is still the market leader in the United States when it comes to electric cars.","Bloomberg reports that Tesla is working to add support for Apple CarPlay in its vehicles. iPhone maker has reportedly started testing the capability internally and could be close to releasing it publicly in the next few months.
