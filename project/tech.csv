The body of a postgraduate trainee doctor was discovered in the seminar hall of the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata in the early hours of August 9. The circumstances surrounding her death have since ignited a nationwide uproar.The series of phone calls that gradually informed her parents of the incident paint a haunting picture of how the rape-murder of the young medic was initially portrayed as a suicide.In the first call, the anxious voice on the other end was insistent yet vague.Who is speaking?I am calling from RG Kar hospital.What has happened?She is unwell. Can you come immediately?But why, what has happened?She is unwell. She has been admitted? Can you come immediately?But what has happened, at least tell us?That doctor will say. I was given your number and asked to inform the family.But please tell us what has happened.Patient is unwell, please come as soon as possible. Rest doctor will inform you.Does she have a fever?You all just come soon, as soon as possible.Is her condition not good?The condition is bad, please come as soon as possible.The lack of clarity and urgency in the initial call from the caller identifying herself as the assistant superintendent of the hospital mirrored the grim reality that awaited her family.The second call, coming from a visibly stressed caller, brought a shift in the gravity of the situation.But please tell me what has happened?Her condition is very bad. Please come as soon as possible.But what has happened?That the doctor will tell, please come soon.Who are you?I am assistant superitendant, I am not a doctor.Is there no doctor there?We have brought your daughter to the Emergency. You come and contact us.But what happened to her? She was on duty.You just come quickly, as soon as possible.The second call only compounded the family's growing horror, with no real answers to the burning questions that plagued them.The final call was the most harrowing of all. The reality of their worst fears was confirmed in a heartbreaking message.I was telling you earlier. The matter is that your daughter has died by suicide. She is dead. Police are here, we are all here, please come as soon as possible.YesThe revelation of the young doctor's death by alleged ‘suicide’ came as a brutal shock to her family, who had been desperately seeking information about her. The ambiguity and coldness of the communication only deepened their anguish. It was later found out that the case being dismissed as ‘suicide’ was actually a case of rape and murder as the investigation revealed.The case, initially handled by the Kolkata Police, has been transferred to the CBI. Civic volunteer Sanjoy Roy has been arrested, and both the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, Sandip Ghosh, and Roy have undergone polygraph tests as part of the ongoing investigation.The tragic death has spurred unprecedented protests across the nation. As the longest-running doctors' protest since the 1980s rocked the nation, the outcry against the alleged rape-murder has brought to light severe issues within the healthcare system.",The body of a postgraduate trainee doctor was discovered in the seminar hall of the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata.

Ever wondered why so many Roman statues are headless? An archaeological perspective,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ever-wondered-why-so-many-roman-statues-are-headless-an-archaeological-perspective/articleshow/112916610.cms,"Unravelling headless statues mystery: Archaeological insights

Natural weak points and accidental damage

Deliberate destruction: Damnatio Memoriae

Modern-day decapitations: Art market exploitation

When exploring classical art museums, it’s common to encounter Roman statues with missing heads, shattered noses, and severed limbs, ever wondered why? Unlike the usually complete displays of modern art, ancient Roman statues often exhibit significant damage, particularly to their heads.To understand why so many Roman statues are headless , experts like Rachel Kousser, a classics and art history professor at Brooklyn College, employ a method akin to ""archaeological CSI."" This involves analysing the context and breaks in the sculptures, looking for patterns, and comparing them to other known cases to piece together the history behind the damage.One of the primary reasons for headless statues is the inherent vulnerability of the neck. It is a natural weak spot on statues, making it prone to breakage during falls, transport, or handling over time. This kind of damage is often accidental and results from the statue being moved or handled improperly.Not all headless statues are the result of accidents. Sometimes, the destruction was deliberate. In ancient Rome, a process known as ""damnatio memoriae"" was used to erase the memory of disgraced emperors. This involved removing or defacing their images from public view. For instance, many portraits of the notorious emperor Nero were intentionally damaged or altered.Roman sculptors sometimes designed statues with removable heads. Kenneth Lapatin, antiquities curator at the J. Paul Getty Museum, explains that this design allowed for different sculptors to work on various parts of the statue or to replace the head if needed. Statues with removable heads often feature a smooth edge where the neck joins, rather than a jagged break.In rare cases, statue heads have been removed in modern times. As Roman sculptures became valuable on the antiquities market, unscrupulous dealers realised they could profit more by selling a headless body and a separate head. One notable example is the Statue of a Draped Woman, which was missing its head when acquired by the Getty Museum in 1972. Archival photographs revealed that the head had been separated from the body sometime before the museum’s acquisition.The process of reuniting a headless statue with its head can be complex. Despite the challenges posed by sloppy cutting and drilling, conservators have successfully restored some statues to their original form. The restoration of the Statue of a Draped Woman is a rare example of a successful reunion between a statue and its head, highlighting the ongoing efforts to preserve and understand these ancient artefacts.","Ancient Roman statues often exhibit significant damage, particularly to their heads.

Let’s keep moving forward with love and positivity! Welcome to the family"".Reflecting on her past struggles, Slaton said, “I was so focused on losing weight, I lost myself. I lost who I was, and I turned to alcohol instead of food. At the same time, I was still eating. I was doing both — damage in two different ways. It would be so easy to fall back into bad habits and gain all the weight back. Then, what was this all for? Wasted time. Wasted money. Wasted effort. Waste.”Tammy pointed out that her transformation was not merely due to diet but a comprehensive “lifestyle change”. Slaton concluded her message with a powerful note of encouragement, saying,“I had a lot of demons, inner demons , that I had to fight. And I’m still fighting. You’re not alone.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Speaking to Engadget, Google’s director of product management for Pixel wearables, Sandeep Waraich, said, “Pixel Watch is our smartwatch part of the portfolio”. Waraich said the same in response to a question about the future of the Fitbit-branded smartwatches, adding that Pixel Watch is “our next iteration of smartwatch for Fitbit.”But while you may not get Fitbit smartwatches, Fitbit brand per se is not being killed.

Google said, ""We are very committed to Fitbit, and even more importantly to the customers that use and depend on those products and technology. It's also worth noting that many of the health and fitness features we launched in Pixel Watch 3 were because of Fitbit's innovation and ground-breaking fitness advancements.

We had consulted Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala for all his niggles and injuries.""Right now he is fine; but before he really starts going full-fledged, it is important for him to get the right physical training, and unless the strength and conditioning program is really spot on, he can get injuries.

He has to defend a lot and then he converts the defence into offense,"" said Vimal.""When he's playing with the wind, he needs to keep putting the shuttle down, come into the net, tumble at the net, so up and down...those sort of things. It takes away a lot of your energy. So he needs to get super fit or develop the ability to control the drift.""",Lakshya Sen will undergo a comprehensive assessment at the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre located in Salzburg.

CMLL confirmed the passing of Villano V and released an emotional statement in which they expressed their heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.Villano V was finally inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame back in 2022.To make this achievement even sweeter, Villano V was inducted along with his four brothers, Villano I, II, III, and IV. Sadly, Villano IV is now the only surviving member of the Villano brothers, who were once hailed as Lucha legends .Villano V, or Ray Mendoza Jr. , was an incredible worker and has even been described as something of a workhorse by many friends and colleagues. He started his career as a teenager back in the 1970s and went on to make a name for himself by working with organizations like AAA, UWA, CMLL, and IWRG.Even though Mendoza Jr. quickly rose to prominence, he didn’t make it to America until the 1990s, which is when he started wrestling for WCW. During his time in America, Villano V worked very closely with his brother Villano IV and went on to put up some incredible performances at shows like WCW Saturday Night and WCW Worldwide.Villano V also returned to CMLL in 2008 for their 75th Anniversary. During his time there, he faced off against Blue Panther, who was an old rival of his. The two put up an incredible performance in their mask vs. mask match, and it is still regarded as one of the best matches of all time.Villano V also teamed up with his brothers at one time to take on the Brazos in an incredible 6v6 mask vs. mask match. It is quite clear to see that Villano has been a part of and is responsible for some of the best performances that Mexican wrestling has ever seen. His passing comes as a shock, but Ray Medonza Jr.’s legacy will surely live on. His time as a heel, his hard work and incredible in-ring performances have inspired a generation of wrestlers who will carry the Villano name forward in the future.","Former WCW star, Villano V, who was a beloved member of the legendary Mendoza family, has sadly passed away at the age of 62.
