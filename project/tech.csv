As the NBA trade deadline approaches on February 6, 2025, theare looking to make a move to improve their frontcourt. Currently positioned in the playoff race, the Lakers are keen on strengthening their roster for a deeper postseason run. One player they’ve been linked to is John Collins, a forward for the rebuilding Utah Jazz. Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors , struggling with a 21-20 record, are also in the market for frontcourt upgrades, making Collins an even more intriguing target.The Warriors, sitting at 11th in the Western Conference, are actively exploring ways to add talent to their roster. According to Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype, the Warriors have been keeping tabs on several potential big men, including Nikola Vucevic, John Collins, Jonas Valančiūnas, and Robert Williams. However, the Los Angeles Lakers could potentially swoop in and steal Collins from under the Warriors’ noses.John Collins, who has been a consistent performer for the Jazz, is an ideal fit for the Lakers’ needs. This season, the 6-foot-9 forward is averaging 17.9 points per game, shooting 43.8% from beyond the arc, and contributing 8.5 rebounds. His ability to stretch the floor and contribute in various facets of the game would make him a valuable addition to the Los Angeles Lakers’ frontcourt alongside Anthony Davis Given the Jazz’s ongoing rebuild, John Collins is their top trade asset, and the Lakers could offer a competitive package to secure him. A potential trade proposal could include Gabe Vincent, Rui Hachimura, and a first-round pick—enough to entice the Jazz while possibly pushing the Warriors to pivot to other targets. While this offer might be considered an overpay, it could be just what the Los Angeles Lakers need to make sure they outbid the Warriors and bring Collins to Los Angeles.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Milwaukee Bucks in pursuit of $146 million Heat forward despite linked trade complications, NBA insider shares his two cents With the Lakers desperate for an upgrade to their frontcourt and the Warriors struggling to climb the standings, the race for John Collins could become one of the most intriguing storylines leading up to the trade deadline. As both teams scramble to make a move, the Lakers may have the edge in securing this versatile and dynamic forward for their playoff push.","The NBA trade deadline is February 6, 2025.

Elon Musk was seen making a weird gesture as he spoke at the inauguration ceremony at Capitol One Arena which was compared to a Nazi salute by many on social media. As he took the stage, Elon Musk thanked the crowd for Donald Trump's victory and celebrated the new mission to Mars. ""The future of civilization is assured,"" Elon Musk said.""This is what victory feels like,"" Elon Musk said with a loud cheer.

Apple is reportedly gearing up to unveil its next-generation iPad Air lineup, featuring the powerful M3 chip . According to a leak by well-known leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming iPad Air models will include both the familiar 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes, powered by the M3 chipset.The M3 chip, while not Apple's top-of-the-line chipset (reserved for the iPad Pro's M4), represents a significant upgrade from the previous M2 chip used in the last iPad Air models. This update promises to boost performance by up to 15%, making it a solid choice for users seeking a more powerful tablet for everyday tasks, multitasking, video editing, and gaming.Despite the internal upgrade, the new iPad Air models are expected to maintain the same sleek and thin profile that has become synonymous with the iPad Air line. There are no major design changes anticipated, but rumours suggest the inclusion of a new Magic Keyboard, specifically designed for the iPad Air, with a new row of function keys for improved functionality.Additionally, there are speculations about a potential 90Hz refresh rate display and Wi-Fi 7 support for faster wireless speeds. These enhancements would provide smoother scrolling and better overall network performance, making the new iPad Air an attractive option for users.Apple is expected to announce these new iPad Air models by March or April 2025, with production starting in Q2 and a targeted launch in Q3 2025.","Apple expected to unveil new iPad Air models by March or April 2025.

"A hoodie, shorts and swag: US senator defies cold, formal suits and elegant coats for Donald Trump's inauguration",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-hoodie-shorts-and-zero-chill-us-senator-john-fetterman-defies-cold-formal-suits-and-elegant-coats-for-donald-trumps-inauguration/articleshow/117411724.cms,"In a sea of formal suits and elegant coats, senator John Fetterman stood out — not for political reasons, but for his sartorial choice. Arriving at President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on a bitterly cold day in Washington, Fetterman donned his signature black hoodie, gray gym shorts, and sneakers, defying both the frigid temperatures and traditional dress codes.With temperatures hovering around 20°F and wind chills in the teens, Washington had declared a cold weather emergency ahead of the event. The swearing-in ceremony itself was moved indoors due to the dangerously low temperatures. Yet, the 55-year-old senator seemed unfazed, powering through the icy conditions in his casual attire.Fetterman’s unconventional wardrobe has been his hallmark throughout his career, even in settings that typically demand more formal attire. While he has occasionally complied with Senate dress codes — wearing a suit and tie while presiding over proceedings — he is known for pushing the boundaries of political fashion. At last year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, for instance, he opted for a tuxedo hoodie instead of traditional black-tie apparel.His outfit at the inauguration quickly went viral on social media, sparking a mix of reactions. Admirers applauded his relatability and connection to everyday Americans.“The dude represents the 'common man,' so there’s nothing wrong with dressing like the common man. I love this, personally!” one user wrote.“Normal attire for him. I thought I’d hate him, but he’s actually one of the most sensible Democrats in Washington,” another chimed in.Others, however, criticised his choice as inappropriate for such a significant national occasion.“It’s appalling and disrespectful to the country,” one commenter argued. “Maybe next time a national ceremonial process happens, Republicans should show up in their pajamas too.”“Zero class. Zero respect for the presidency. Zero respect for himself. It’s embarrassing,” another user wrote.","John Fetterman wore a black hoodie, gray gym shorts, and sneakers to the inauguration.

Ahaus: Visiting Germany's 'smartest' town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ahaus-visiting-germanys-smartest-town/articleshow/117388160.cms,"(AP photo)

QR-Codes galore in the 'smartest town'

Digitization to halt urban decline in Germany

Cashless and free of conflict

Local currency to keep money in town

On a typical day in December, visitors arrive at Smartel, one of the bigger hotels in Ahaus , a town of 40,000 inhabitants in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.Pulling their rolling suitcases and with mobile phones in hand, guests are ready to scan a QR code on a terminal screen at the entrance.Rather than being greeted by a receptionist, arriving guests must use their smartphones to navigate the hotel. These devices not only open doors but also control room heating and lighting as there are no switches.In the hallway and lobby, cleaning robots are quietly humming. The only humans you may occasionally encounter are the kitchen staff replenishing the breakfast buffet.Peter Sommer explains that the Smartel was formerly named the Ratshotel Residenz, which used to be the largest hotel in town. Sommer, a travel guide from Smart City Ahaus, says the building's glorious past came to an end in the early 2000s.After struggling to find a new owner, Ahaus-based digitization company Tobit decided in 2017 to turn the hotel's fortunes around by modernizing the building and equipping its 44 rooms with the latest smart-home technology that one of its subsidiaries, Chayns, develops.What's striking in this medium-sized German town is the huge number of blue-and-white circular stickers with QR codes attached to virtually everything. Bearing the Chayns logo, they can be found on restaurant tables, hotel doors and riverboats, as well as rent-out bicycles, supermarket shelves, and even on the games cabinet in the town park. They provide an easy way to digitally book, pay for and unlock many amenities.At the end of 2024, Ahaus was crowned the smartest rural municipality in Germany following the nationwide ""Digital Places 2024"" contest organized by the Deutschland — Land der Ideen (Germany — Land of Ideas) initiative.The government-sponsored campaign is intended to enhance Germany's international visibility as a hub of ideas and innovation and is supported by business and civil society.Prize-winning Ahaus was commended for integrating multiple applications into a single platform that is easy to access with an app that requires one-time registration with contact and banking data.For Margarete, a caregiver from nearby Velen, the Ahaus experience provides a glimpse of what the future in her hometown could look like. She has joined us on the guided tour and laments that in Velen you will no longer even find a local supermarket. If she wants to go out for dinner, she has to make a reservation days in advance.So-called urban decline is a problem for many smaller towns in Germany due to population loss, economic stagnation and lack of investment. Small shops and cinemas are disappearing, while hospitality businesses are struggling to find staff and customers. Could massive investment in digitization stem the silent death of these communities?In Ahaus, finding enough people to work at tourist attractions, for instance, is no longer an issue. Humans are no longer required at the boat rental service situated near the town's baroque water castle.Bikes and umbrellas can also be rented digitally, just like meals at the local TKWY diner. There, a video screen shows who's next to pick up their food after being ordered on the Chayns app.Margarete finds this ""a bit impersonal,"" and says she would miss the casual chatting with the waiters. ""But efficient,"" counters our tour guide, Peter, arguing that staff can now focus on the cooking. Knowledge of the German language also ""doesn't matter,"" he contends, because the food can be ordered in different languages.In the bars and pubs of Ahaus, staffing needs are also minimal as bartenders and waiters only serve what guests have prepaid online, eliminating disputes over bills and age verification. Users' data is stored in their Chayns account.According to Tobit, almost 80% of all hospitality businesses in Ahaus use the Chayns app, whose service has grown to include farmers, sports clubs, and other service providers. They use Tobit's digital network to sell products or grant cashless access to facilities around the clock.At a pub named The Unbrexit, waiter Sven Klawikowski still brings drinks and meals to the tables. But he no longer needs to take orders, process payments, or check in with customers to see what else they need. With ten tables to look after, this saves enough time to equal the workload of an entire shift, he says. Moreover, he can afford to work just four days a week, while still receiving a full week's wage.The Wallstreet Bar , close by, is one of the formerly empty properties in Ahaus that were purchased by Tobit to test out its technology. Inside the bar, a stock market ticker continuously scrolls across a huge screen.While having a drink, customers can invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, or commodities. But this offer is just for fun as it's only a virtual reality game without real money.""We can test new technologies and make them accessible to other cities,"" says Sommer.Benedikt Hommöle, head of Ahaus Marketing & Tourism, thinks tech companies like Tobit find it easier to pilot their beta-phase projects in the town because the municipality and its residents are on board. ""We embrace the living lab concept. We're the guinea pigs, but in return, we have things here that others don't,"" he told DW.One frequently replicated digital concept is the so-called city voucher, a local digital currency that, according to Tobit, has been emulated by more than 70 municipalities.In Ahaus, the vouchers are used as welcome gifts to new residents and the winners of the weekly online quiz. Employers also use city vouchers to distribute monthly subsidies to workers. They are also popular as presents or pocket money.However, the money can only be spent in the town and must be used within a limited timeframe. ""You can use it to buy dog food, bread rolls, or new tires,"" says Hommöle, adding that vouchers worth close to €800,000 ($816,000) are now circulating each year.As Ahaus is situated close to Germany's border with the Netherlands, the town is popular with Dutch tourists. At the end of our tour, Peter Sommer recalls a recent visit by mayors of 10 Dutch towns and cities, which are known for being more open to all things digital than Germany.Sommer says that for Germans, Ahaus feels like pure science fiction. The Dutch visitors merely stated, ""Not bad for Germany.""","Ahaus, a town of 40,000 inhabitants in the western German state of North Rhine- Westphalia, was crowned the smartest rural municipality in Germany.

The Duchess of Sussex , Meghan Markle has announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute, in a post on Tuesday. She shared a touching video montage of her 'sweet' companion, who was scheduled to appear in her upcoming Netflix programme.The Duchess expressed her profound grief, acknowledging countless tears shed whilst thanking her faithful pet for years of unwavering devotion. She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy. You filled my life in ways you’ll never know,"" the Suits star added., the anticipated programme, launching on January 15, will showcase the Duchess sharing her expertise in cooking and gardening, the Daily Mail reported.Additionally, viewers might also have noticed a black Labrador in the brief promotional footage for Meghan's Netflix programme - Pula, who joined the family before Archie's arrival in 2019.","The Duchess of Sussex announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
