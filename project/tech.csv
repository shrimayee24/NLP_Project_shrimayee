Kayla Nicole stuns in daring dress as fans claim she’s trying to upstage Taylor Swift ’s romance with Kelce



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are turning heads yet again with their flourishing summer romance. The couple was recently spotted enjoying a private dinner at San Vicente Bungalows in New York City, accompanied by Swift’s brother, Austin. Their low-key night out follows Kelce's involvement in the fifth annual Tight End University event — a mix of professional bonding and lighthearted fun that’s become a signature part of his offseason.While Swift and Kelce enjoy each other’s company both on the field and off, Kelce's former flame, Kayla Nicole, is making waves in her own right. The fitness influencer and sports personality dropped jaws on Instagram with a series of captivating photos and a video. In a sleek black dress with gold accents, Nicole posed elegantly at a restaurant and captioned the post with bold confidence: “Date Idea: I’m dinner and the view. ”The post set social media abuzz. Reactions poured in from fans who couldn’t help but admire her poise and charm. While some resorted to emojis, others didn’t hold back their praise. “So stunning queen,” one admirer wrote. Another added, “The dress and you wow,” summing up the collective sentiment across the comments.Kayla Nicole, who was in a high-profile relationship with Travis Kelce for five years before they split in 2022, has continued to remain a dynamic figure in NFL circles. From supporting the Philadelphia Eagles during their Super Bowl LIX victory over the Chiefs to being a prominent voice on the I Am Athlete Daily podcast, Nicole has carved a distinct niche for herself.Off the mic, she’s also building a brand rooted in wellness. As CEO of Tribe Therepe, Nicole is on a mission to redefine fitness by focusing on the mind-body connection. “It’s focusing on the mental health component of working out, which is really, really important for me and really resonates with me,” she told PEOPLE. “I think that when your mind is in a healthy place, your body will follow.”Her impact doesn't stop at fitness or podcasting. Nicole recently launched her own show, The Pre-Game, where she’s unfiltered about everything — including her dating life. While she's known for her past with Kelce, she’s made it clear that her future might steer away from dating athletes altogether.“I’ll never say never, but I fully, wholeheartedly believe that I am out of the athlete stage,” Nicole said. “I would love to date an executive of a record label or a movie producer so that we can go to the sporting events. Let date night be courtside at the Lakers game, that’s my kind of guy.”Whether it’s through viral posts or meaningful projects, Kayla Nicole is proving that she’s in a league of her own — with or without an NFL player by her side.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn","Kayla Nicole was in a high-profile relationship with Travis Kelce for five years before they split in 2022.

"What is China's mosquito drone? Capable of capturing images, audio & electronic signals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-mosquito-drone-capable-of-capturing-images-audio-electronic-signals-details/articleshow/122090220.cms,"Representative AI image





NEW DELHI: China showcased a miniature, insect-like drone designed for covert surveillance missions, drawing global attention and concern over its potential military and espionage uses.Developed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), the drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It was unveiled on the Chinese military broadcaster CCTV-7 as part of an exhibit on next-generation robotic systems.In a demonstration aired over the weekend, NUDT student researcher Liang Hexiang held up the ultra-light robot and said, “Here in my hand is a mosquito-like type of robot. Miniature bionic robots like this one are especially suited to information reconnaissance and special missions on the battlefield.”The drone, resembling a real mosquito, is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. It can reportedly operate silently and without radar detection, carrying ultra-miniature cameras and microphones to capture images, sounds, and electronic signals. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.According to The Defense Post, the device’s compact build enables it to evade conventional detection systems and operate in confined spaces — a feature that has raised alarms among privacy advocates and military analysts.Experts warn that such drones could be exploited for espionage, cyber intrusions, or even biological warfare.“This could mean greater access to restricted areas such as secure government facilities,” noted Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. “If China is able to produce mosquito-sized drones, it would likely be interested in using them for various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks, especially in places that larger drones struggle to access, such as indoor areas. These drones could be used to track individuals or listen in on conversations.”Other experts are raising more dystopian concerns. Tracey Follows, a futurist and former Google advisor, told The Sun that such drones could be used for “untraceable murders” or carry pathogens, referencing a Black Mirror episode in which robotic insects were weaponised for targeted killings. “In time, one expects a drone to have the situational awareness to carry out an attack autonomously without a human in the loop,” she said. “The big question is what's the payload on these drones, what are you actually attaching to the drone?”The mosquito-sized UAV is part of a broader NUDT programme exploring micro-robotics, with parallel developments including artillery-launched drones that can survive the extreme conditions of being fired from 155mm cannon shells. These innovations reflect China’s ambition to lead in micro-UAV technology, a field seeing increasing global competition.Other countries have made strides in this area. Norway’s Black Hornet, developed by Teledyne FLIR Defence, is already used by militaries worldwide. The latest version, the Black Hornet 4, won the 2025 Blue UAS Refresh award from the US Department of Defence for advancements in battery life, signal range, and wind resistance. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s RoboBee project has demonstrated insect-sized drones that can transition from water to air and even perch on surfaces using static electricity.Beyond military applications, microdrones are being explored for civilian use in medicine, agriculture, and disaster response. In healthcare, they could enable precision drug delivery or internal imaging. In environmental monitoring, their small size allows access to hazardous zones during floods, fires, or chemical spills.Still, with their stealth capabilities and growing autonomy, these tiny machines are poised to become one of the most ethically and strategically complex technologies of the decade.","The drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

What the organisers of the AI robot football match said



The world's first-ever football match between AI-powered humanoid robots was held in China recently. This match featured humanoid robots wearing black and purple jerseys, competing in a 3 vs 3 match, which was played for two 10-minute halves, a report claimed. In this match, the movements of the robots were guided by built-in algorithms. Instead of testing fast-paced action, the event was said to be aimed at showing balance, agility, and AI-based decision-making. As per the report, the robots even raised their fists after scoring.These games, in which Chinese technology institutions reportedly participated, highlighted developments in machine autonomy . Such a match is said to be the first in China and may be a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games , which are also set to be held in Beijing.According to a report by China News Network (seen by Bloomberg), teams from Tsinghua University and Beijing Information Science and Technology University participated. A Tsinghua team, named Vulcan, won the championship, the report added. A video of the same was also shared by Beijing Evening News.In a statement to the news agency AP, the organisers of the AI robot match said that a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.Fitted with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to detect the ball and move around the field with reasonable agility. They were built to stand up on their own after falling, though some still needed to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff during the match, adding a realistic element to the event, the organisers noted.These robots were supplied by a company named Booster Robotics, the publication adds. The company’s CEO, Cheng Hao, said that sports competitions provide a practical environment for testing humanoid robots, supporting progress in both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.","The world's first-ever football match between AI-powered humanoid robots was held in China recently.

Meta used public, not private, data train its generative AI models



Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold After 1 Year: Is It STILL My Daily Driver? (Long-Term Review)

After years of training its generative AI models on billions of public images from Facebook and Instagram , Meta is reportedly seeking access to billions of photos users haven't publicly uploaded, sparking fresh privacy debates. While the social media giant explicitly states it is not currently training its AI models on these private photos, the company has declined to clarify whether it might do so in the future or what rights it will hold over these images, a report has said.The new initiative, first reported by TechCrunch on Friday (June 27) sees Facebook users encountering pop-up messages when attempting to post to Stories. These prompts ask users to opt into ""cloud processing,"" which would allow Facebook to ""select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on a regular basis.""The stated purpose is to generate ""ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling or themes like birthdays or graduations.""The report notes that by agreeing to this feature, users also consent to Meta's AI terms, which permit the analysis of ""media and facial features"" from these unpublished photos, alongside metadata like creation dates and the presence of other people or objects. Users also grant Meta the right to ""retain and use"" this personal information.According to The Verge, Meta recently acknowledged that it used data from all public content published on Facebook and Instagram since 2007 to train its generative AI models. Although the company stated it only used public posts from adult users over 18, it has remained vague about the precise definition of “public” and what constituted an “adult user” in 2007.Meta public affairs manager , Ryan Daniels, has reiterated to the publication that this new “cloud processing” feature is not currently used for training its AI models, a, told The Verge,""[The story by the publication] implies we are currently training our AI models with these photos, which we aren’t. This test doesn’t use people’s photos to improve or train our AI models,"" Maria Cubeta, a Meta comms manager, was quoted as saying.Cubeta also described the feature as “very early,” innocuous, and entirely opt-in, stating, ""Camera roll media may be used to improve these suggestions, but are not used to improve AI models in this test.""Furthermore, while Meta also said that opting in grants permission to retrieve only 30 days' worth of camera roll data at a time, Meta's own terms suggest some data retention may be longer.“Camera roll suggestions based on themes, such as pets, weddings and graduations, may include media that is older than 30 days,” Meta's says.",Facebook reportedly seeking access to billions of photos users haven't publicly uploaded.

Ford charts different course for autonomous future

Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley openly questioned Tesla's camera-only approach to autonomous vehicles , expressing stronger support for Waymo's laser sensor technology at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Friday. The automotive executive emphasized consumer trust and safety concerns as key factors driving Ford's skepticism toward Tesla's self-driving strategy.""When you have a brand like Ford, when there's a new technology, you have to be really careful,"" Farley told interviewer Walter Isaacson. When directly asked to compare Tesla and Waymo's systems, Farley chose Waymo without hesitation, stating ""We really believe that LiDAR is mission critical.""The debate centers on fundamental technological approaches to autonomous driving. Tesla relies exclusively on cameras and artificial intelligence, while Waymo incorporates LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) laser sensors alongside cameras for enhanced environmental detection.Farley highlighted LiDAR's advantages, noting that ""where the camera will be completely blinded, the LiDAR system will see exactly what's in front of you."" This redundancy addresses industry concerns about Tesla's camera-only system, which critics argue lacks sufficient safety backups.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has defended his company's approach, claiming economic superiority. During Tesla's April earnings call, Musk argued that ""Teslas probably cost 25% or 20% of what a Waymo costs and made in very high volume,"" positioning cost-effectiveness as a competitive advantage.Ford has abandoned plans to develop fully autonomous Level 4 systems in-house, instead pursuing partnerships with established self-driving companies. The automaker shuttered its $1 billion Argo AI joint venture with Volkswagen in 2022, pivoting toward collaboration rather than internal development.Currently, Ford focuses on its BlueCruise Level 2 system, which enables hands-free highway driving while requiring driver attention. Farley described the company's strategic shift: ""We decided that a cooler problem than full autonomy in an urban setting was high speed, eyes off.""The comments underscore growing industry division over autonomous vehicle development approaches, with traditional automakers increasingly favoring sensor-rich systems over Tesla's minimalist camera strategy.",Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley openly questioned Tesla's camera-only approach to autonomous vehicles.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Gisele Bundchen déjà vu? Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriend stuns in lookalike dress, causing stir with Tom Brady



What was supposed to be a celebration of love between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez quickly became a buzzworthy weekend of unexpected fashion choices and surprising celebrity moments. Held at the opulent Gritti Palace in Venice, the “wedding of the century” welcomed nearly 200 A-listers from around the globe — but it was Leonardo DiCaprio ’s girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti, and NFL legend Tom Brady who subtly stole the spotlight.Vittoria Ceretti, the 27-year-old Italian model dating Leonardo DiCaprio since 2023, drew all eyes when she arrived at the wedding wearing a vintage Dolce & Gabbana gown — not just any gown, but the very same one Gisele Bündchen wore to the 2003 Met Gala. Though the dress had been updated with modern touches, including a tattered finish and sheer fabric, the resemblance was uncanny. Page Six was quick to point out the fashion déjà vu, and it didn’t go unnoticed.The choice of attire sparked quiet murmurs in elite circles. After all, Gisele — DiCaprio’s on-again, off-again partner from 2000 to 2005 — had left a mark not only on Leo’s past but also on NFL icon Tom Brady’s life.The dress unintentionally stitched together two high-profile men with one unforgettable woman. While Gisele had once reflected, “We were just not meant to be boyfriend and girlfriend, but I respect him enormously, and I wish him nothing but the best,” the flashback fashion moment was hard to overlook — especially with Brady in attendance.Brady, who dated Gisele starting in 2006 and married her in 2009 before divorcing in 2022, seemed unfazed. Instead, the former quarterback found himself at the center of entirely different speculation. During the reception on the scenic island of San Giorgio Maggiore, he was seen laughing and dancing with actress Sydney Sweeney . The two shared a chemistry that caught many off guard, sparking rumors of a potential romance.The 27-year-old “Euphoria” star and the 47-year-old NFL legend appeared completely at ease, engaging in light-hearted conversation and spontaneous dance moves. Their flirty interaction became one of the night’s biggest talking points, even overshadowing Ceretti’s controversial wardrobe choice and Brady’s brief stint in the DJ booth.Whether this playful encounter is the start of a new chapter in Brady’s personal life or just a fleeting moment between two celebrities remains unclear. But for now, it has given fans and media plenty to speculate about.Bezos and Sanchez’s $20 million wedding — complete with celebrity guests like Oprah, Kim Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner — may have had the glamour, but it was the undercurrents of nostalgia and new flirtations that truly lit up the weekend. In an event that brought past, present, and possibly future loves into one Venetian celebration, the fashion and feelings were as dramatic as the backdrop itself.Also Read: Chiefs' heiress Gracie Hunt sparks buzz with patriotic Chiefs-themed July 4th tribute and bold message on liberty","Vittoria Ceretti, the 27-year-old Italian model, wore a vintage Dolce & Gabbana gown.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce win the internet while her ex continues his messy meltdown



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are keeping the summer romance alive in the most New York way possible — with quiet, fashionable, and very exclusive dinner dates. The high-profile couple was recently spotted enjoying a private evening out at San Vicente in West Village, joined by none other than Swift’s brother, Austin. Tucked away in the club’s ultra-discreet, no-photo interior, the trio “sat alone quietly,” a source told Page Six, adding that “no one bothered them.”For Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, both 35, privacy seems to be the new luxury. San Vicente, a members-only spot that recently opened its New York location, is already known for hosting Hollywood elite like Jennifer Aniston, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Prince Harry. It’s also famed for enforcing a strict no-photos policy, making it a go-to for celebrities seeking refuge from the relentless gaze of paparazzi.The couple didn’t just enjoy a dinner — they made a fashion statement. Swift arrived in a $3,490 pink-and-white Balmain houndstooth dress with gold chain straps and matching buttons, accessorized with a beige purse and Christian Louboutin heels. Kelce complemented her look in a crisp white short-sleeve dress shirt, black pants, and black loafers. Earlier in the week, they were seen stepping out hand-in-hand in matching white outfits, capturing attention yet again.Their recent city rendezvous follows a week spent in Nashville, where Swift not only showed up to support her NFL beau at his Tight Ends University event but also surprised everyone with an impromptu performance of “Shake It Off” at the “Tight Ends and Friends” benefit concert — her first public performance since the end of the blockbuster Eras Tour. That concert alone helped raise over $900K for charity, including Kelce’s own foundation, 87 & Running.While their public appearances reflect joy and stability, a familiar ghost from the past seems determined to hover. Matty Healy, Swift’s ex and frontman of The 1975, stirred headlines after throwing shade at her latest album The Tortured Poets Department during his Glastonbury set. “I’m probably the best songwriter of my generation. The best, what do we say, A POET...ladies and gentlemen, is what I am,” Healy declared sarcastically, before launching into “Chocolate. ” Though he later claimed he was joking, the timing didn’t go unnoticed by Swifties.Despite the lack of a ring, speculation around a possible engagement continues to mount. Nilesh Rakholia, founder of Abelini jewelry, told Daily Mail, “Knowing Taylor, the ring itself, or the way it’s revealed, might contain subtle nods or 'Easter eggs' for her fans.”As they inch closer to their rumored two-year anniversary, Swift and Kelce seem unfazed by external noise — choosing instead to indulge in intimate dinners, public hand-holding, and quiet gestures of support that say more than any headline could. Whether wedding bells are on the horizon or not, the couple continues to write their love story one glamorous NYC outing at a time.Also Read: “I did marry a farmer”: Hailee Steinfeld wants to trade glam for a garden in dream farm life with Josh Allen","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were spotted at San Vicente in West Village.

Seemingly determined to make another push into the music spotlight, Paulina Gretzky , daughter of the NHL father figure Wayne Gretzky, attracted some attention this past week. With her strong social media charisma and occasional performances in the past, she just teased her followers with a rather subtle but intriguing glance at what may well be the sound of the near future. This was almost out of character, for it did not resemble a spur-of-the-moment shot; it appeared to be very purposefully staged. In a past life or two, the teenage years have dabbled in entertainment; with these new collaborations in music, this recent post has kept people buzzing once more.Mostly known for the glitz behind being a model and shining on social media, music has always been a shadow lurking behind her. This move looks like more than just a feather in the cap. Over the weekend, she posted on Instagram a picture of her car dashboard displaying a track titled ""If These Heels Co ..."" with her name attached to it. The photo seemed to be an almost clear indication that she had been working on a project, sending her followers into a frenzy of speculation.The announcement was preceded by some earlier signs indicating that a musical comeback was on its way. In March, Paulina posted a bunch of pictures showing her in a Nashville studio.Some showed her next to the professional soundboard, alongside country singer Tyler Reeve. They seemed relaxed and focused; all clear signs of an actual creative partnership working at full swing. One such image showed Reeve playing guitar while Paulina remained seated beside him, which resembled the organic kind of collaboration that one might expect in a songwriting session.The direction had already been hinted at a few months earlier by Paulina. In December, she had shared Instagram stories with Reeve and Chris Young-the country artist-whilst at the studio for some sort of holiday-related project. The studio was decked out in Christmas lights and a neon sign declaring: ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Paulina also posed for a picture with both musicians in front of the decorated tree to cement the warm association.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina Gretzky, embraces a stunning new look that blends comfort and elegance With her name having been linked to an unreleased song, Paulina Gretzky seems set to embark on a new chapter in her creative life.

And if there ever was a future for the Gretzky name, fans might be cheering both for style and sound this time around.","Paulina Gretzky posted on Instagram a picture of her car dashboard displaying a track titled ""If These Heels Co..."" with her name attached to it.

2025 NHL Draft goes virtual, but LA Kings make a teen fan’s dream come true

LA Kings let 17-year-old fan announce Will Sharpe as 2025 Draft pick



The 2025 NHL Draft took on a new format, but the Los Angeles Kings made sure the energy didn’t fade. While most teams worked behind closed doors, the Kings created a fan-first moment that stole the spotlight by letting a 17-year-old supporter announce one of their official draft picks live on stage.Despite concerns surrounding the NHL’s decision to bring back a decentralized draft format reminiscent of the COVID-19 era, the Los Angeles Kings made it personal. With over 3,000 fans in attendance and thousands watching on TV and online, the league leaned heavily on high-end cameras and advanced technology to deliver the event. Still, many feared the lack of a traditional draft stage would drain the experience of its usual excitement. That’s when the Kings did something extraordinary.In a post on X, the LA Kings shared a screenshot of a fan interaction captioned, “Always shoot your shot.” The post featured 17-year-old fan Jeremy Roth, who commented that he could hype up the crowd better than NHL Central Scouting Director Dan Marr. The Kings noticed the comment and turned it into a real opportunity during the 2025 NHL Draft.The Kings didn’t just respond, they invited Roth to join NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly during the draft.

Best weapons for Ann Takamaki to ignite the battlefield



Note:

Ann Takamaki's team tactics and skill focus



ANNS FLAMES ARE STILL BURNING! UNIT REVISIT! | PERSONA 5: THE PHANTOM X

Unlock Ann Takamaki's full potential



Ann Takamaki in Persona 5: The Phantom X gameplay is the fiery-hearted Panther who is a fan-favourite. The Phantom Thief is the powerhouse that specializes in devastating fire attacks. With her Carmen Persona, she dominates the battles with some high-damage AoE skills and also burns effects. Veterans and new players alike can harness her potential. Understanding her optimal gear, skill progression, and team synergies is key to dominating Metaverse. Let us dive within building Ann for maximum impact.Ann thrives with her fire-boosting weapons, which can enhance her damage output. To equip her right would amplify her strength quite immensely. Her top choice remains 5-star Rosethorn, which can increase fire damage by approximately 24.2%, and she inflicts burn on enemies, too. If La Vie En Rose remains active, fire damage will escalate further as per the burning foes, capping at a max 76% boost.Rosethorn weapon remains accessible early through the Plans tab. It can synergize with her unique mechanics perfectly.For a much more accessible option, the 4-star Masquerade Ribbon of Ann would also raise her attack by 12% and add approximately 23.7% to it when attacking the burning enemies.As Rosethorn remains obtainable early via in-game rewards, it is the preferred pick to maximize her firepower.Complementing the armament is the Strife Revelation Card Set. It can be found in the Words of Feuds domain challenge. The set is tailor-made just for Ann, the Panther, and delivers bonus fire damage and additional attack boost when exploiting the enemy's weaknesses. Give priority to stats like Damage% (Moon), Attack% (Sky), and Crit Rate (Star) on the cards. The combination would ensure her spell would hit with an overwhelming force, melting all enemy defenses.Building around Panther would mean embracing a mono-fire team to achieve peak efficiency. The core lineup here would pair her with Cattle and Key, who have proven to be exceptionally potent. The trio would leverage the fire synergies and enhance team cohesion and damage output.Players who seek more explosive results can swap Cattle with Leon and create a hypercarry setup. It would definitely sacrifice some sustainability but would push Ann's damage ceiling dramatically high. Some Personas of Wonder, like Dionysus (Crit Rate/Damage) or Surt (Defense Down), can further amplify the offensive pressure of the team.To master, Ann needs strategic skill upgrades. Her Persona, Carmen, even offers some potent fire abilities. Ensure priority is given to enhancing Trifire (Skill 3) at first. The potent and single-target burn skill will become more devastating against the weakened foes. Then focus on Skill 1, Crimson Rose. It is Ann’s powerful AoE attack that even buffs her own strength. The Thief Tactics would follow, as the Highlight attack can deliver some massive AoE fire damage and offer crucial short-term damage buff. Skill 2, Falling Sun, while it remains useful, rounds out the priority list here.The unique Passion mechanic and La Vie en Rose (LVR) state of Ann state remain central to her kit. To deal fire damage can build Passion stacks. At 4 stacks, she can enter LVR, quite significantly giving a boost to her attack. To understand the rhythm remains vital.Her awareness level can unlock power enhancements, including party-wide attack buffs during the LVR, some potent follow-up attacks, as it would end, and some substantial damage increase per Passion stack. While the passive boosts come from the duplicates, they do solidify her position as the top fire unit.Ann, in short, is the cornerstone character. To obtain it is quite straightforward, but building her effectively can unlock the path of destruction through mid- and early-game. Also, to equip Rosethorn, use the Strife set and pair Ann with Key and Cattle while giving priority to Trifire and Crimson Rose upgrades; the players could unleash the character's full and fiery fury on any foe who dares to stand within the way of Phantom Thieves.","Ann thrives with her fire-boosting weapons, which can enhance her damage output.

*UPDATED* CURSED THIEF! BEST JOKER GUIDE & BUILD! | PERSONA 5: THE PHANTOM X

What Makes Joker Worth Pulling?

1. Reliable Curse DPS

2. Low Investment, High Reward

3. Synergizes Well

What Are the Disadvantages of Pulling Joker in Persona 5: The Phantom X?

1. Future Power Creep

2. Dependent on Synergy

Wonder meets Joker - Persona 5: The Phantom X ( Global )

Limited-Time Only – Should That Matter?

So, Should You Pull?

In(P5X), the hype around Joker’s limited-time banner is real, and for good reason. Joker’s a limited-time 5-star unit with major damage potential and serious nostalgia value. But is he just fan service, or does he genuinely shift your game? Here’s everything you need to know!As the iconic leader of the Phantom Thieves, Joker isn’t just here for nostalgia. He brings serious firepower, flexibility, and a toolkit that can carry your team through early and mid-game content with style. In P5X, he’s not just a story icon — he’s a gacha unit with impressive skills, especially in the Curse element category. If you loved him in the OG, he’s back, upgraded, and ready to carry teams in a new way.Here’s why the Joker is worth pulling in P5X:Joker brings insane Curse-type AoE damage, making him one of the top-tier damage dealers in the early meta. His skill scaling is strong even without needing his 5-star weapon, which is a rare W in gacha design.You don’t need to whale. Joker performs exceptionally well with 4-star setups and shines even without maxed constellations or “phantom resonance.” He’s beginner-friendly but still endgame-viable.Pair him with Rin (a free unlock with enough pulls), and Joker’s potential skyrockets. Rin debuffs enemies, boosting Joker’s output massively. It’s a duo you’ll keep using across story and PvE challenges.Here are some downsides of pulling the Joker in P5X:Joker is the first limited 5-star. That means more powerful characters will eventually enter the roster. Pulling for Joker now means locking in strong value early, but it could come at the cost of saving up for future banners.His full potential depends on other units like Rin. Without that support, his damage may not feel as explosive as other standalone DPS units.Yes and no. If you’re a F2P player or on a tight budget, the limited window can feel stressful. But Joker isn’t bait — he’s genuinely powerful and usable across content. If you have the resources, pulling now gives you an early advantage, especially in mid-game stages where AoE damage is king.Yes, of course. Unless you’re saving for a very specific future unit or are extremely low on Meta Crystals, pulling for Joker is a smart move. He’s stylish, strong, and surprisingly efficient and will get a solid return on your gacha investment.","Joker’s a limited-time 5-star unit with major damage potential and serious nostalgia value.
