Finland for beginners: 5 quick tips

Finland, consistently ranked as the world’s happiest country in the World Happiness Report, draws global talent with its exceptional quality of life, strong social welfare system, and breathtaking natural scenery. For Indian citizens, securing permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation grants full rights to live and work, opportunities for family reunification, and a pathway to citizenship. Recent 2025 immigration reforms have streamlined the process for skilled professionals from outside the EU, making Finland an attractive destination amid labour shortages in fields such as IT, healthcare, and engineering.Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely, along with access to essential public services such as healthcare and education. It also provides the freedom to travel freely within the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, permanent residency does not expire, though the residence card itself must be renewed every five years within the specified timeframe. However, this status should not be confused with Finnish citizenship, which comes with stricter requirements — including proof of language proficiency and a longer period of continuous residence, typically eight years.The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on work visas and family reunification, rather than directly on permanent residency. Under the new rules, family sponsors must have lived in the country for a minimum of two years, and spouses are required to be at least 21 years old. At the same time, work permits have been simplified for specialists, with fast-track processing available for high-salary positions, which now require a monthly gross income of EUR 1,600 (around INR 1.65 lakh).To qualify, you must have continuously lived in Finland for four years under a Type A (continuous) residence permit, beginning either from your arrival in the country or from when the permit was issued. Time spent on Type B (temporary) permits for short-term work does not count toward this period. Additionally, you must have been physically present in Finland for at least two of these four years, with all absences for holidays or work abroad properly documented.Your temporary permit’s underlying reason, such as employment or family connections, must still be valid to apply for Permanent Residence (PR). PR is not available to students or individuals on job-seeker permits. Before applying for PR, you must first switch to a Type A work or family-based permit.Although permanent residency doesn’t directly mandate these, obtaining the initial Type A permit typically requires financial and professional stability. For employment-based applications, candidates must either earn at least EUR 40,000 annually (around INR 41.3 lakh) or hold a recognised master’s/postgraduate degree with a minimum of two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, demonstrating C1-level proficiency in Finnish or Swedish along with three years of work experience can also strengthen eligibility.Applicants must provide a clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation. They should have no outstanding debts or dependence on social welfare. Any criminal history may negatively impact the approval process.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall, which require proper preparation and adaptability for a smooth transition to life in Finland, ensuring long-term comfort and success.Embrace nature: When in Finland, one can’t help but be impressed by nature. From vast forests, lakes, and national parks to activities like hiking and kayaking, for an outdoorsy traveller, Finland is perfect.Try a sauna: Finnish folks love their sauna. There are over 2 million saunas for a population of 5.5 million! A sauna visit is more like a social experience, wellness benefits come along naturally.Plan around the seasons: Thinking when to visit? Winters (December–March) bring snow, Northern Lights, and winter sports. Summers (June–August) offer the Midnight Sun, endless daylight, and hiking opportunities.Learn a few local phrases: While most Finns speak English, learning a few Finnish phrases can enhance your experience. Simple greetings like “Hei” (Hi), “Kiitos” (Thank you), and “Moi” (Hello/Bye) go a long way.Explore beyond HelsinkiLapland offers reindeer rides, husky safaris, and Santa Claus Village. The Lakeland region provides serene lakes and charming towns, while Turku and Tampere showcase Finnish history and culture.With proper planning and preparation, Indians can fully enjoy all that Finland has to offer and make the most of their permanent residency experience.Also See: Sweden becomes the first country to be prescribed by doctors: Inside “The Swedish Prescription” campaign",Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely.

Elon Musk allegedly rumored to threaten $40 million Super Bowl deal over Bad Bunny halftime show? Here’s what’s really happening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/elon-musk-rumored-to-threaten-40-million-super-bowl-deal-over-bad-bunny-halftime-show-heres-whats-really-happening/articleshow/124500148.cms,"A viral claim that Elon Musk threatened to withdraw a $40 million Super Bowl sponsorship over Bad Bunny's 2026 halftime performance has been debunked. Despite widespread social media speculation, fact-checkers and even Musk's own AI, Grok, confirmed no such threat was made. Bad Bunny's performance remains confirmed, highlighting the rapid spread of online misinformation.

How the rumor linking Elon Musk to a Super Bowl pullout went viral

Grok , Elon Musk’s AI bot, and fact-checkers shut down the false claims

The announcement of Bad Bunny as the 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer has ignited a storm of online controversy, and at the center of the noise stands one unexpected name, Elon Musk . Over the weekend, social media platforms lit up with claims that the billionaire had allegedly threatened to pull a $40 million Super Bowl sponsorship over the Puerto Rican singer’s involvement. But after days of speculation, fact-checks reveal that the viral claim holds no truth.The rumor began circulating through a post from a profile called Girl Patriot, claiming, “Elon Musk has threatened to pull his $40 million Super Bowl sponsorship if Bad Bunny, announced as the 2026 halftime performer, goes on. Musk and conservative critics oppose Bad Bunny’s comments about fearing ICE raids at his concerts, calling them anti-American.”Within hours, the claim was shared widely across social media, amplified by politically charged accounts and fan reactions. Some users cheered Musk’s supposed decision, while others accused him of censorship. However, no credible publication or verified source supported the story.Gridiron Heroics, a sports commentary outlet, ran a report citing the viral post, tracing it back to an obscure website that has previously published false stories, including one about Musk building a “sanctuary for homeless families.”Despite the lack of verification, the claim spread quickly, echoing the modern internet trend where sensationalism often outpaces fact.To add irony to the situation, Musk’s own AI platform, Grok, stepped in to debunk the rumor. The bot fact-checked the post, stating, “No, this claim appears to be false. Elon Musk hasn’t posted anything about Bad Bunny or Super Bowl sponsorships on X. Similar rumors about other sponsors have been debunked by fact-checkers. Bad Bunny is confirmed as the 2026 halftime performer, though.”Also Read: Cam Newton gets emotional as Auburn retires his jersey: “My kids witnessed how cool their dad is” As of now, there is no evidence that Musk has ever sponsored the Super Bowl or made any financial threats against the NFL . Despite the noise, Bad Bunny remains confirmed as the official halftime performer, while the rumor underscores how quickly misinformation can spiral, especially when celebrity names collide with politics and pop culture.","A viral claim that Elon Musk threatened to withdraw a $40 million Super Bowl sponsorship over Bad Bunny's 2026 halftime performance has been debunked.

Elon Musk’s xAI studio aims to create innovative AI-generated video games



Experts warn AI content creation cannot match human creativity and vision



Musk’s Grok aims for AI movies while raising copyright and ethical concerns

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation.

“Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the appeal and commercial potential of the game,”

“This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video game pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future,”





GTA 6 is expected to generate more revenue at the standard $70 price point than at a higher $100 price, a new analysis claims. A study by MIDiA Research (seen by IGN) suggests that pricing the highly anticipated game at $100 would deter potential buyers and ultimately result in lower overall earnings for developer Rockstar.said Perry Gresham, co-author of the report and Head of Data at MIDiA Research. “A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table,” he added.The study also indicates that raising the game’s price beyond $70, which it describes as an “optimum” point, could lead to lower revenue due to fewer people buying GTA 6.said co-author and Games Analyst at MIDiA, Brandon Sutton.Sutton added.According to the survey results from over 2,000 US consumers, 60% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase the game at $69.99. To compare, 35% said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ buy it at $99.99.The study also found that only 16% of consumers would buy the game at $149.99, while 79% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase it at $49.99.Rockstar is expected to announce the game’s official price closer to its release date, which is set for May 26, 2026.

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry.

Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",EU demands digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.

The arrival of an exceptionally large newborn often sparks both medical attention and public fascination. Shelby Martin, a first-time mother from Nashville, Tennessee, recently captured worldwide interest after giving birth to her son, Cassian, weighing an astounding 12 pounds, 14 ounces (5.8 kg). His birth not only set a new record at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital but also went viral online, with thousands reacting in disbelief and humour. Cassian’s extraordinary size highlights the natural variation in human births while underscoring the strength and resilience required of mothers during delivery. Despite the challenges associated with delivering a jumbo baby, both Shelby and her son are thriving, demonstrating the remarkable combination of maternal endurance and expert medical care that makes such births possible.Shelby Martin shared her pregnancy journey on TikTok, showcasing an unusually large baby bump. Her humour and candid commentary struck a chord, quickly amassing over 4.4 million likes and tens of thousands of comments. In the video, she quipped, “When people talk about having a big baby… trust me, I know big,” giving viewers a glimpse of the size of her unborn son before birth, while also sharing tips on coping with physical strain, cravings, and the emotional ups and downs of late-stage pregnancy.Social media users responded with disbelief and humour, with comments jokingly asking how long the baby had been inside or suggesting creative ways he might have been delivered. The viral moment highlights how extraordinary pregnancies can captivate public attention, especially when coupled with light-hearted commentary, relatability, and genuine, everyday parenting experiences that resonate widely online.As reported by The New York Post, Cassian, Shelby’s newborn son, weighed a staggering 12 pounds, 14 ounces at birth via C-section. This size is remarkable, as the average newborn in the United States weighs approximately 7 pounds, according to Stanford Children’s Health. Cassian’s birth marks the largest at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital in more than three years, leaving both doctors and nurses in awe of his size and overall health.Despite his impressive size, Cassian required only a brief stay in the NICU for monitoring. He received IV fluids, oxygen support, and glucose monitoring to ensure stable health in his first critical days. Doctors acted quickly to prevent complications, and Shelby expressed her gratitude to the medical team, highlighting the importance of professional care and support during complex deliveries.Babies born with exceptionally high birth weights—commonly referred to as macrosomic or “jumbo” babies—pose unique challenges during delivery. Mothers may require C-sections to safely deliver infants over 10 pounds due to increased risks of complications, such as prolonged labour, perineal tears, and shoulder dystocia. NICU monitoring for glucose levels, oxygen, and feeding is often necessary to ensure the newborn’s smooth transition after birth.These precautions underscore the importance of skilled obstetric and neonatal care, particularly in cases of extreme birth weights. Shelby’s experience demonstrates that, with proper medical support, both mother and child can thrive, even in extraordinary circumstances.Cassian is not the first oversized newborn to make national news. In Florida, Daniella Hines delivered her son Annan at 13 pounds, 15 ounces in early September, while in Alabama, Pamela Mann welcomed her daughter Paris Halo weighing 13 pounds, 4 ounces in March. These births show that, while rare, jumbo babies occur across the country, often inspiring social media fascination and local media coverage as reported.For comparison, a typical newborn weighs between 6 and 8 pounds, meaning these infants are nearly double the size of average babies. Their births offer both medical intrigue and a reminder of the wide spectrum of normal human development.Extraordinarily large babies often bring a mixture of awe, humour, and practical challenges. Families celebrate the milestone, while medical teams carefully manage delivery risks. Social media reactions—from playful jokes to expressions of amazement—highlight the fascination these births inspire globally.Babies weighing over 9 pounds, 15 ounces at birth are generally classified as macrosomic. While genetics and maternal health play key roles, factors like maternal diabetes or prolonged pregnancies can contribute to higher birth weights. Careful prenatal monitoring, preparation for potential C-section deliveries, and NICU readiness are crucial for safe outcomes.","Shelby Martin shared her pregnancy journey on TikTok, showcasing an unusually large baby bump.

Anil, a Mangalorean comedian known for his viral sketches, champions Malgudi Restaurant, which specializes in Karnataka-style dosas. For him, it’s a nostalgic experience,the crispiness, the butter, and the famed “benet dosa” he had heard about but never tried until now.

Raf and Mel, a creative couple running a fast-growing food page, support Yummy Dossa , a spot outside Karama that reimagines dosa by blending bold, almost rule-breaking Mumbai street food influences with traditional South Indian flavors. Their approach brings a lively, chaotic energy that makes their dosas unforgettable.

Shaz, a Chennai native and YouTuber with over a million subscribers, advocates for Saravanaa Bhavan—perhaps the most established name in South Indian vegetarian cuisine worldwide. For him, it’s the go-to spot when seeking authentic, no-frills dosa that stays true to tradition.

If you’ve lived in Dubai long enough, you know that debates over food can be just as passionate as those over traffic or rent. And among South Indian communities, and anyone who’s ever fallen for the irresistible crispness of a dosa, the question of who makes the best dosa is more than just idle chat, it’s about a dish steeped in tradition and regional pride, with contested origins between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.Led by one of the UAE’s most beloved storytellers, Khalid Al Ameri, known for his uplifting content and deep dives into identity, family, and food, recently set out to find the best dosa in Dubai in his recent YouTube video , armed with a camera, and rallying five Dubai-based creators to help settle the score, or at least stir it gently.“We’re on a mission to find the best dosa in the city, as ranked by all of you on social media,” he announces at the start of the video, which quickly turns into a warm, witty, and flavor-packed journey across five distinct restaurants.Khalid’s guests are not just tag-alongs, they each champion a different style of dosa, each coming from a personal, cultural, or creative place.With the lineup and itinerary in place, Khalid sets out not just to sample dosas, but to explore the stories of tradition, creativity, and nostalgia that each one carries.At Malgudi, the focus is on authentic Karnataka flavors. Anil, a comedian from Mangalore, admits this is his first visit here, despite his roots.The star of the show is the “benet dosa” — smaller and thicker than the usual, made from a rice and lentil batter. What sets it apart is the generous spread of white unsalted butter flown in from Karnataka, lending a rich creaminess that’s hard to forget.In the kitchen, the chef tests the pan’s heat with a splash of water — a simple but crucial step to get the crisp right. The batter is spread thin and cooked to a golden crisp. The dosa is filled with onions, cheese, and a dusting of pi powder, a spicy, flavorful addition. The chutneys served alongside—coconut, tomato, garlic, and a tangy secret chutney called puli in wa—complement the dish perfectly.Anil’s enthusiasm is clear; the crisp texture and buttery richness hit all the nostalgic notes. Malgudi’s dosa earns a solid 10 out of 10 for its authentic, heartfelt preparation.Yummy Dossa is where dosa gets a bold, modern twist. Established in 2017, this spot brings a creative fusion of South Indian and Mumbai street food influences, resulting in innovative, visually striking dishes.Their standout is the matka dosa, a layered, cheesy, gravy-filled creation that bursts with flavor. Khalid Al Ameri likens it to “dosa on steroids,” with its bold, layered preparation that feels less like cooking and more like painting a canvas, applying fillings directly onto the dosa to pack every bite with taste.At the end of the menu is the Nutella dosa, a sweet and indulgent take that pushes boundaries by turning the dosa into a dessert experience.Yummy Dossa scores a 10 out of 10 for its fearless creativity and execution, redefining what dosa can be without losing its soul.Here, the dosa takes on a minimalist, health-conscious approach. Vasantha Bhavan, a Dubai staple since 1997, emphasizes balance over indulgence, using minimal ghee to create a lighter, yet still flavorful, dosa.Rohit, known for his witty social media commentary, appreciates this dosa for its straightforwardness and clean flavors. The dosa is crisp but not oily, paired with well-seasoned sambar and chutneys that hit just the right notes without overpowering.Khalid calls it “the healthiest dosa I’ve ever eaten,” and it’s easy to see why. It’s not flashy, but it’s reliable, a dosa you can enjoy any day without guilt. Rohit awards it a 9.5 out of 10, valuing its elegant simplicity and thoughtful preparation.Sangeetha brings a sense of tradition and familiarity, having been a part of Dubai’s food scene since 1984. The dosa is served on banana leaves, adding an earthy, nostalgic touch. The chutney is slightly coarse, evoking homemade authenticity, while the filter coffee is sharp and refreshing.Jasmine, a creator with a fondness for classic dishes, chooses the paper roast dosa — an extra-thin, crispy sheet that crackles delightfully when torn. She likens it to a dosa she’d bring to a family gathering: understated but dependable.The dosa evokes a sense of home and comfort, despite some minor rough edges in the chutney. Jasmine rates it 8 out of 10, appreciating the genuine experience that harks back to old memories.Saravanaa Bhavan is the heavyweight of South Indian vegetarian cuisine, serving hundreds of thousands daily worldwide. For Shaz, a YouTuber and Chennai native, this dosa is deeply personal — a taste of home and tradition.The highlight is the ghee roast girros dosa, paired with classic potato-onion masala, crisp vada, and strong filter coffee. The dosa is rich but balanced, with the familiar flavors that define Chennai’s culinary heritage.For Khalid and Shaz, this dosa represents authenticity in its purest form — no gimmicks, just a straightforward, satisfying meal. They give Saravanaa Bhavan a perfect 10 out of 10 for its faithful representation of tradition.So, who wins?Khalid’s verdict is simple: everyone.Instead of crowning a single champion, he honors all five restaurants with a special recognition — because the “best” dosa isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s about what resonates with you.Because here’s the real takeaway:The best dosa is the one that reminds you of home, or helps you make a new one. It might be slick with butter like in Malgudi, wild and sweet at Yummy Dossa, light and clean at Vasantha Bhavan, paper-thin at Sangeetha, or soulfully complete at Saravanaa Bhavan.Each version holds its place, tells a story, and leaves behind a little more than just a satisfied stomach. And that’s what Dubai does best — it turns even the most regional of traditions into something global, yet deeply personal.","The best dosa in Dubai has been voted on by five Dubai-based creators.

Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across several affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Agencies demand compensation and control

OpenAI scrambles to add guardrails





Hollywood studios and talent agencies are pushing back hard against OpenAI 's Sora 2, the AI video generation app that launched last week and quickly rocketed to over 1 million downloads. The Creative Artists Agency, which represents stars like Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks, called the platform a ""significant risk"" to creators' intellectual property rights. Disney has already opted out of having its copyrighted material appear on the platform, sending a letter to OpenAI stating it never authorised the company to use its characters and has no obligation to ""opt-out"" under copyright law. Warner Bros. and Universal have similarly taken legal stances, having already sued AI image generator Midjourney over copyright infringement earlier this year.The controversy centers on Sora 2's original ""opt-out"" system, which allowed users to generate videos featuring copyrighted characters unless rights holders specifically requested removal. Users created viral clips of everything from SpongeBob SquarePants cooking meth to Sam Altman grilling Pikachu, sparking immediate legal concerns.""Does OpenAI believe that humans, writers, artists, actors, directors, producers, musicians, and athletes deserve to be compensated and credited for the work they create?"" CAA questioned in its statement. United Talent Agency echoed this sentiment, calling Sora's approach ""exploitation, not innovation.""In response to mounting pressure, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the company would give rights holders ""more granular control over generation of characters"" and implement stricter content restrictions. The Motion Picture Association urged OpenAI to take ""immediate and decisive action"" to prevent copyright infringement.However, the damage may already be done. The app's rating has plummeted to 2.9 stars on Apple's App Store, with users frustrated by new restrictions. Meanwhile, the legal precedent is clear: entertainment companies have successfully sued AI platforms before, and OpenAI's ask-for-forgiveness-later approach could prove costly.","OpenAI scrambles to add guardrails to its AI video generation app. Disney has already opted out of having its copyrighted material appear on the platform.

“AI doesn’t dream”: Jim Lee explains why DC will never touch generative AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-doesnt-dream-jim-lee-explains-why-dc-will-never-touch-generative-ai/articleshow/124501818.cms,"The bold New York Comic Con declaration comes after DC faced backlash over AI-suspected comic covers





DC Comics president Jim Lee just drew a hard line in the sand about generative AI—and he's not budging. Speaking at a retailer's day panel at New York Comic Con this week, Lee told fans that DC ""will not support AI-generated storytelling or artwork,"" adding emphatically: ""Not now, not ever, as long as Anne DePies and I are in charge. ""The declaration, reported by The Verge, got loud cheers from the crowd—a sign that comic book fans are pretty fed up with AI creeping into their beloved medium.Lee didn't hold back in explaining why. ""People have an instinctive reaction to what feels authentic. We recoil from what feels fake,"" he said. ""AI doesn't dream. It doesn't feel. It doesn't make art. It aggregates it."" He emphasized that the imperfections in human-created work—the smudges, rough lines, and hesitations—are what give comics their soul.The strong stance likely stems from DC's own messy encounters with AI. The company has faced several controversies over variant comic book covers suspected of using generative AI, leading to backlash and eventual replacements. Those incidents apparently pushed DC to take a firmer position going forward.Lee compared AI concerns to other tech scares that fizzled out, like Y2K and the NFT craze. But unlike those flash-in-the-pan moments, he's making sure AI doesn't become DC's problem.""Anyone can draw a cape. Anyone can write a hero,"" Lee said. ""But Superman only feels right when he's in the DC universe. Our universe, our mythos. That's what endures.""It's a refreshing commitment from one of comics' biggest publishers, especially as Hollywood studios continue flirting with AI despite growing public backlash. Whether this stance holds up long-term remains to be seen, but for now, DC's heroes are staying firmly in human hands.","DC Comics president Jim Lee said the company ""will not support AI-generated storytelling or artwork"" ""Not now, not ever, as long as Anne DePies and I are in charge,"" he said.

The AI researcher reportedly confirmed his departure in a recent message to employees. This move is the latest recruiting win for Meta as it shifts focus toward building out its AI teams. Tulloch also has a history with Meta, having worked for the Facebook parent for 11 years previously. He departed in 2023 for a tenure at OpenAI before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab with Murati at the start of this year. This move comes as Meta is currently focusing on organising its AI talent to pursue what the company calls superintelligence. In June, Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang joined the social media giant after Meta invested $14.3 billion in the startup.In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, a spokeswoman for Thinking Machines Lab said:She also added that Tulloch’s contributionsin helping the company reach its current position.the spokeswoman noted.A previous report even claimed that Tulloch was offered a compensation package from Meta that could have reached about $1.5 billion, factoring in top bonuses and strong stock performance, but he turned it down.A Meta spokesperson later described that characterisation asnoting that the value of any package depends on stock growth. However, details of the offer Tulloch accepted remain undisclosed.Meta has been aggressively expanding its AI workforce, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally reaching out to top researchers via email, WhatsApp, and private meetings. Over the summer, he recruited more than 50 experts from companies such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Apple, Anthropic, and xAI, including Tulloch, one of several former Thinking Machines employees approached.Thinking Machines, founded by Mira Murati in February with $2 billion in funding and staffed by over 20 former OpenAI colleagues, recently launched Tinker, an API for fine-tuning large language models.Meta has also restructured its AI operations into a new Superintelligence Labs division, led by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, following its acquisition of a 49% stake in Scale AI. The division now includes four teams, including TBD Lab, which is working near Zuckerberg’s office on future versions of Meta’s Llama language model.The company plans to spend up to $72 billion this year on data centres to support its AI goals and recently launched an AI video generator feature in its Meta AI app, following OpenAI’s similar release.","Andrew Tulloch, a co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab, has left the company to join Meta Platforms.

"OpenAI’s startup boss to European companies: Americans are ""almost shameless"" when ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openais-startup-boss-to-european-companies-americans-are-almost-shameless-when-/articleshow/124483958.cms,"FILE - (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)





American startup founders are “almost shameless” in their assertive demands and feedback to AI giant OpenAI , according to Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA. Speaking at the Sifted Summit this week, Modiano highlighted a stark contrast between U.S. and European entrepreneurs, urging the latter to be more vocal to seize opportunities in the fast-evolving AI landscape. Drawing from her experience working with founders across both regions, Modiano praised American entrepreneurs for their directness.“They come in and say, ‘We need this. You need to improve that,’” she said during a fireside chat. “If founders don’t tell us, we don’t always know.” She encouraged European founders to adopt a similar approach, warning that silence could mean missing out on shaping AI advancements. Modiano pointed to Swedish startup Lovable, valued at $1.8 billion, as a model for effective feedback. The vibe-coding company, which launched its GPT-5-based Lovable Assistant 5 alongside OpenAI’s latest model, provided intensive input during early access. “I was in their office for a week, and every hour we were having reviews,” Modiano recounted, noting that European developers’ feedback directly influenced GPT-5’s development.Another success story is Sana, a Swedish AI-learning platform. Modiano recalled visiting their office, where founders demanded specific voice capabilities, such as tone and speed adjustments. This feedback was cross-referenced with similar requests, leading OpenAI to prioritize those features on its roadmap. “We can only ship what customers tell us they want,” Modiano emphasized, suggesting startups appoint a “chief feedback officer” to ensure their needs are heard.Her comments fuel an ongoing debate about the cultural differences between U.S. and European entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, venture capitalists criticized European founders for lacking the intensity of their American counterparts, with some urging them to adopt a seven-day workweek to compete globally. Harry Stebbings of 20VC previously told CNBC that Europeans often undersell their ambitions, while Americans excel at crafting compelling narratives to pitch their businesses.The critique extends beyond startups. U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle recently sparked controversy by claiming British university students lack the entrepreneurial drive of their American peers. Speaking at an Nvidia event in London, Kyle questioned how many U.K. undergraduates attend university with the goal of becoming founders, lamenting a perceived lack of “vigour” in British entrepreneurial culture.Modiano’s call to action is clear: European founders must speak up or risk being left behind in the AI revolution.","Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA, praised U.S. entrepreneurs for their directness.

“When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world. What they’re going to … need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,”
