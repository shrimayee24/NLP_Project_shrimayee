Is Xavier Legette's steamy kiss with GloRilla a PR stunt or a real love story in the making?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-xavier-legettes-steamy-kiss-with-glorilla-a-pr-stunt-or-a-real-love-story-in-the-making/articleshow/121687455.cms,"Xavier Legette is rumored to be dating Grammy-nominated rapper GloRilla (Getty Images)

What’s really going on between Xavier Legette and GloRilla after that passionate on-screen kiss?



GloRilla – Typa (Official Music Video)





NFL wide receiver Xavier Legette is used to making headlines with his performance on the field, but lately, it's his off-field moves that have fans buzzing. The Carolina Panthers’ rising star has stirred up major attention after appearing as rapper GloRilla’s love interest in her latest music video “Typa. ” From their sultry bedroom scenes to the chemistry they radiated on camera, fans are left wondering—are these two simply collaborators, or is there something more?Xavier Legette, known for his Southern charm, viral accent, and unapologetically bold style, isn’t new to the social media spotlight. But this time, it's not about his unique personality or his love for raccoons—yes, really—it’s about the steamy visuals shared with the Grammy-nominated rapper. Featured on the cover art of “Typa,” Legette is seen getting extremely close with GloRilla, setting the tone for a music video that’s intimate, eye-catching, and loaded with relationship rumors.In the video, which dropped Friday morning, the 24-year-old NFL wideout and the “Tomorrow” hitmaker take their roles beyond surface-level flirtation. At one point, GloRilla, clad in white lingerie, shares a passionate kiss with a shirtless Legette in what looks like a heated bedroom rendezvous.This scene—arguably the most talked-about part—has viewers speculating whether the duo's chemistry is strictly professional or crossing into something personal.Adding more intrigue to the storyline is R&B icon Keyshia Cole, who makes a cameo during a mid-video conversation with GloRilla. Given that “Typa” samples Cole’s classic track “Love,” her presence adds nostalgic weight and another layer of authenticity to the video. But for many, it’s Legette and GloRilla who have stolen the show.What has added fuel to the romantic speculation is the fact that neither GloRilla nor Legette has publicly addressed the nature of their relationship. Legette, who just wrapped a stellar rookie season with 49 receptions, nearly 500 receiving yards, and four touchdowns, has kept his personal life under wraps since his 2024 draft into the NFL. Similarly, GloRilla has rarely let fans in on her private affairs—until now.“The lyrics of ‘Typa’ talk about her love for a country man with, uh, other features (just listen for yourself),” which makes Legette a fitting choice for the role. Whether this is a savvy PR move blending music and sports for mutual clout, or the beginning of something genuine, remains to be seen. Either way, it’s one of the most talked-about crossovers of the year.So, is it all a calculated move or the spark of something real? As fans wait for confirmation—serious dating rumors or just another collaboration?Also Read: 'Queen of Buffalo' Hailee Steinfeld finally shares exclusive wedding photo with Josh Allen, revealing gorgeous rings",Xavier Legette is rumored to be dating Grammy-nominated rapper GloRilla.

Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld breaks silence with official wedding photo fans were waiting for







Hollywood elegance met gridiron greatness as Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen officially became husband and wife in a magical ceremony held at the scenic San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. The wedding, which took place on May 31, was nothing short of a fairytale, blending cinematic charm with NFL prestige. With close friends, family, and a host of Buffalo Bills stars in attendance, the celebration quickly became the talk of both entertainment and sports circles.The wedding festivities began with a touch of chic simplicity—Steinfeld stunned guests in a stylish short rehearsal dress before walking down the aisle, hand-in-hand with her father, Peter. As cameras captured the moment, her smile radiated joy, but it was their first kiss as a married couple that stole hearts online. The photo of the kiss went viral, encapsulating the love and energy that defined the day.Among the attendees were Bills teammates Dawson Knox, Dalton Kincaid, Spencer Brown, Mitch Trubisky, and Shane Buechele, showing strong support for their quarterback off the field. The guest list even included a few surprises, like comedian and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" creator Larry David, whose presence only added to the buzz surrounding the event.Allen, 29, proposed to Steinfeld, 28, back in November with a cinematic sunset moment in Malibu—a fitting scene for a couple whose relationship has been marked by moments worthy of a Hollywood script. Since going public with their romance in 2023, they’ve remained relatively private, opting to share only glimpses of their journey with fans.But on June 6, just days after their vows, Hailee Steinfeld broke the silence with a heartfelt surprise. Though she wasn’t able to send out her usual Beau Society newsletter due to the whirlwind of wedding events, the Oscar-nominated actress delighted fans with a single yet powerful update. “We’re married! More to come…” she wrote, sharing an exclusive photo of the newlyweds that instantly made rounds online.That simple message ignited a wave of excitement among her subscribers and supporters, who have come to cherish the weekly newsletter she launched last September. While she's always been committed to maintaining that connection—even sending short updates during hectic weeks—this time, fans were more than understanding.Now, with her wedding dress still fresh in the minds of fans and supporters, Steinfeld seems to have embraced a new title entirely. As one viral Buffalo billboard so boldly put it, she really is “The Queen of Buffalo.”With love, laughter, and a wedding that seamlessly blended star power and sincerity, Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld have officially started their next chapter together—one that fans everywhere are cheering on.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers believes dolphins having sex could actually heal his body—and he’s serious about it","Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld married on May 31.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race. Robin Thicke opened with a private concert, followed by a surprise Sunday night set from DJ Rampa, who premiered new speakers to an electrified crowd including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.Created by Ben Biscotti and Sylvain Bitton, RD Grand Prix was designed to mix tech billionaires, royalty, and fashion icons with racing fans in a setting of unrivaled luxury.

This event combined music, art, and philanthropy in an intimate, lively atmosphere. Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin.

Today's NYT Connections answers



Explanation of the groupings

NYT Connections is back with a fresh grid for Saturday, 7 June. If you’ve been scratching your head over today's set of words, you're not alone. The game is designed to challenge your vocabulary, lateral thinking, and pattern recognition skills. While some groups may be obvious, others can be surprisingly tricky. Whether you’re looking for a small push or a full breakdown, we’ve compiled a complete guide to today’s puzzle. Below you'll find thematic clues, complete answers, and an explanation of the logic behind each grouping—without spoiling it too early for those still solving.Connections is a word association puzzle from the New York Times where players are given 16 seemingly unrelated words. The objective is to organise them into four groups of four, based on a hidden connection. These connections might relate to word categories, functions, or even puns. The game is well-loved for its blend of simplicity and subtle complexity, often luring players into overthinking what turns out to be a straightforward link. Each puzzle has one correct solution, and a limited number of incorrect guesses are allowed, which raises the stakes as the game progresses.To begin, you’ll see 16 words arranged in a 4x4 grid. Your goal is to sort them into four sets of four, each sharing a common theme. Tap or click on four words you believe are related, and submit your guess. If you're correct, the group locks in. If not, you’ll receive a warning—and you're only allowed four errors before the puzzle ends. The puzzles increase in difficulty as you progress, and the colour-coded results reflect that: yellow is the easiest, followed by green, blue, and then purple as the trickiest.Here are the general themes for each of these four groups in today’s puzzle:Yellow group: rain, snow, hail, sleetBlue group: cello, flute, drum, violinGreen group: cell, guard, sentence, wardenPurple group: business, marathon, programme, engineThe yellow group was fairly straightforward, covering common types of precipitation you might hear in a weather report.The blue group focused on orchestral instruments, each widely used in classical music.The green group revolved around prison-related terms, with a mix of personnel (guard, warden), locations (cell), and legal concepts (sentence).The purple group was the most abstract, consisting of words that describe things that can be “run”—such as a business, a computer programme, a marathon, or an engine.The key to solving this one was recognising the metaphorical use of the word “run” in different contexts.","Connections is a word association puzzle from the New York Times.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST) The company is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names.

"Bill Atkinson, engeineer who helped Apple co-founder Steve Jobs create Lisa and Macintosh computers, dies at 74: Read CEO Tim Cook's post",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-atkinson-engeineer-who-helped-apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-create-lisa-and-macintosh-computers-dies-at-74-read-ceo-tim-cooks-post/articleshow/121703267.cms,"Bill Atkinson: The brain behind QuickDraw and HyperCard project



Atkinson was convinced by Jobs to become 51st team member of Apple



Bill Atkinson , the Apple Computer designer instrumental in creating the graphical user interfaces that made the Lisa and Macintosh computers accessible to millions, has died. He was 74. His family confirmed the cause as pancreatic cancer in a Facebook post. He had a close relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs during the early 1980s when they worked on the Macintosh. Apple CEO Tim Cook has extended his condolences with a post on X (formerly Twitter).""We are deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Atkinson. He was a true visionary whose creativity, heart, and groundbreaking work on the Mac will forever inspire us. Our thoughts are with his loved ones,"" Cook said in a post.Atkinson was the programmer behind QuickDraw, a foundational software layer for both the Lisa and Macintosh computers. This library of small programmes efficiently displayed shapes, text and images on screen. Embedded in the computers' hardware, QuickDraw provided the distinctive graphical interface that presented a simulated ""desktop"" with icons for folders, files, and applications.Atkinson is widely credited with inventing key elements of graphical computing, including ""pull-down"" menus and the ""double-click"" gesture, which allowed users to open files and applications simply by clicking a mouse button twice.Before the Macintosh debuted in January 1984, most personal computers were text-based, requiring users to type complex commands. Graphics were not an integrated function, and mouse pointing devices were not common.QuickDraw was initially developed for Apple's Lisa computer, launched in January 1983. Though the Lisa offered early easy-to-use features for business users, its high price of $10,000 (nearly $33,000 today) led to its commercial failure.QuickDraw soon became the basis for the Macintosh's successful graphical interface. This approach to computing originated from the ""Dynabook"" project led by computer scientist Alan Kay at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s.In 1979, Xerox provided Jobs and a small team, including Atkinson, a private demonstration of Kay's work. Since they could not examine the software code, the Apple engineers made assumptions about the technology, leading to fundamental technical advancements and new capabilities.After the Macintosh's release, Atkinson conceived HyperCard, a programme that wove together text, images and video in a simple database. This software became a significant precursor to the World Wide Web.Atkinson was pursuing a Ph.D. in neurobiology at the University of Washington when Jobs convinced him to become Apple's 51st employee. Their relationship was close during the early 1980s as they worked on the Macintosh. However, when Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 to found Next, Atkinson declined to leave, citing his commitment to the HyperCard project.","Atkinson was the programmer behind QuickDraw, a foundational software layer for both the Lisa and Macintosh computers.

Eid Al Adha 2025: Dubai airport welcomes Eid travellers with special passport stamps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/eid-al-adha-2025-dubai-airport-welcomes-eid-travellers-with-special-passport-stamps/articleshow/121697581.cms,"A traveller shows the 'Eid in Dubai' stamp on his passport.

Celebrating Eid Al Adha 2025



Over 80,000 stamps issued



A cultural welcome that resonates



What to know if you’re arriving



Timing matters: The stamp is available during Eid week at select immigration counters.

Request it politely at immigration if it isn’t offered by default.

Keep the passport page as a souvenir (it doesn’t impact visa status).

Check availability depending on their arrival terminal, Terminals 1, 2, and 3 may vary slightly.





Passengers arriving in Dubai during the Eid Al Adha holidays are being welcomed with a specially designed passport stamp that reads ‘Eid in Dubai’, part of a festive initiative by Dubai’s General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA).The commemorative stamp, introduced at Dubai Airports and the Hatta border crossing, was designed by Brand Dubai, the creative arm of the Government of Dubai Media Office. Images shared by the Dubai Media Office show the stamp placed prominently in arriving passengers' passports, symbolising a warm, cultural welcome as they enter the country during one of the most important festivals in Islam.The GDRFA confirmed that immigration officers have been stamping passports with the unique design since the start of the holiday weekend. The initiative aligns with broader efforts to offer a meaningful and memorable entry experience for travellers.Eid Al Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, began in the UAE on Friday, June 6, following the Day of Arafah. Residents are enjoying a four-day weekend from Thursday, June 5 to Sunday, June 8.Commemorating Prophet Ibrahim's devotion, the festival is observed with special prayers and traditional animal sacrifices.Across Dubai, the holiday is being celebrated with fireworks displays, cultural performances, and festive menus in malls and public venues. Notably, Dubai Parks and Resorts is hosting fireworks visible from Riverland Dubai, enhancing the holiday atmosphere for residents and visitors alike.According to officials, more than 80,000 travellers have already received the commemorative stamp. Visitors from countries such as India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the UK, and the Philippines have shared their stamped passports on social media, describing it as a joyful and surprising gesture.Many have taken photos of the stamped pages and posted them online, tagging Dubai Airports and sharing messages of appreciation. “Arrived in Dubai and was greeted with the most beautiful Eid stamp! What a way to start the holidays,” wrote one traveller from London.Brigadier General Talal Al Shanqeeti, of the GDRFA, explained the significance of the campaign, noting that it represents the values of hospitality, tolerance, and joy that the UAE seeks to offer every visitor. The stamp is part of the wider vision to celebrate culture through simple, human-centred gestures.Immigration officers have reported strong positive feedback. Some passengers have asked specifically for the stamp, while others were moved emotionally by the thoughtful welcome.Even airlines such as Emirates and Flydubai have reported passengers asking about the stamp while still onboard.The stamp initiative serves as a small but powerful example of how Dubai blends culture with modern hospitality. For Muslim travellers observing Eid far from home or first-time visitors to the UAE, it adds a memorable personal touch to their arrival experience, turning a routine entry process into something festive and meaningful.","Eid Al Adha began in the UAE on Friday, June 6, following the Day of Arafah.

Eid Al Adha 2025: Viral escapes by sacrificial animals cause traffic jams and public safety incidents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/eid-al-adha-2025-viral-escapes-by-sacrificial-animals-cause-traffic-jams-and-public-safety-incidents/articleshow/121694409.cms,"Image composite: X

Viral moments: Humor meets havoc





Fear, not rebellion



Real injuries, real risk



A call for respect and responsibility







During Eid Al Adha, scenes of worship and tradition unfold across the Arab and Islamic world , but increasingly, so do scenes of chaos. As families attempt to carry out the sacred act of animal sacrifice, viral videos from cities like Cairo, Istanbul, and beyond have shown a different side of the holiday: calves charging through busy roads, goats leaping over market stalls, and sheep bolting down alleys with panicked owners in pursuit.As reported by Gulf News, these incidents , both comedic and alarming , have become a recurring and highly visible feature of the Eid season in urban centers, raising deeper questions around animal welfare, safety, and public conduct during religious rituals.Across social media platforms, particularly during Eid, feeds have been flooded with clips capturing the sudden escapes of sacrificial animals , usually seconds before they’re due to be slaughtered. In one widely shared video from Egypt, a terrified ram was seen darting through congested traffic, weaving swiftly between cars and motorcycles as pedestrians jumped out of its way.Other viral clips showed animals crashing into storefronts, toppling goods, and in some cases, injuring bystanders as untrained handlers lost control. One sheep reportedly jumped a vegetable stall before disappearing into a residential alley, with children and butchers giving chase.While many viewers reacted with humor, resharing the clips alongside jokes and emojis, others were uneasy about what these videos really represented.“Behind the funny videos are real people, some of whom saved for months to afford the sacrifice,” said Dr. Walid Hindi, a psychological health consultant based in Cairo. “And behind the fleeing animal is often a child frightened, a parent panicked, or a motorist in danger.”Veterinary experts say the problem isn’t disobedience, but fear. Animals are overwhelmed during Eid, especially in densely packed city areas where sensory overload is common, crowds, blood, loud noises, and heat create a high-stress environment.“When sheep smell blood, they instinctively flee. It’s fear, not disobedience,” said one veterinary expert, highlighting that many animals are handled by untrained individuals with little understanding of how to manage stress responses.The scenes might look amusing to some, but they stem from deep-rooted challenges around urban sacrifice practices, improper animal handling, and growing pressure on families trying to uphold religious traditions in tight spaces with minimal resources.The situation took a more serious turn in Turkey, where local media reported that over 14,000 people were injured during the Eid Al Adha holiday while attempting to slaughter animals without professional help. According to the country’s health minister, most of these injuries were preventable.He urged citizens to seek out trained butchers and designated slaughterhouses, warning that lack of expertise not only endangers people but also increases the suffering of the animals.Elsewhere across the Arab world, similar but smaller-scale incidents have caused traffic jams, property damage, and minor injuries, underscoring the need for safer, more organized sacrificial practices in urban areas.Beyond safety, religious scholars have expressed concern about how these incidents , and especially the viral videos , frame the ritual of sacrifice. Some believe the public sharing of these chaotic moments risks reducing a solemn act of worship into viral entertainment.“The act of sacrifice is a profound form of worship,” said Dr. Hisham Rabi’, a scholar at Egypt’s Dar Al Ifta.“It deserves solemnity , not spectacle or amusement.”His remarks point to a broader appeal for dignity, compassion, and respect in how the sacrifice is conducted, and perceived. Eid Al Adha is, at its heart, a spiritual practice rooted in devotion and empathy, not spectacle.","Viral videos from cities like Cairo, Istanbul, and beyond have shown a different side of the holiday: calves charging through busy roads, goats leaping over market stalls, and sheep bolting down alleys with panicked owners in pursuit.

Designed to streamline the immigration process, Smart Gates eliminate the need for manual passport stamping or document checks for eligible users. Once registered, passengers can simply walk up to the gate, look into a camera, and, if verified, pass through in just a few seconds, making arrival and departure at Dubai’s airports faster, contactless, and highly efficient.According to the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA-Dubai), the following categories of passengers are allowed to use Smart Gates, as long as they are registered:Note:Registered users must be at least 1.2 metres in height.Some passengers are not eligible to use the Smart Gates, even if they meet the above categories. These include:Most international passengers who passed through the passport control checkpoint at Dubai Airports may be registered for Smart Gates, but you must find out if you are eligible through GDRFA-Dubai.1. First, visit the website - gdrfad.gov.ae 2. Scroll down on the homepage, until you see the service, ‘Inquiry for Smart Gate Registration’ and click on the red ‘Start Service’ button.3. Next, choose one of the options:• File Number - You can find the file number on the visa sticker on your passport, or on the e-visa you received as a visitor. If you choose file number, you have to select the file type as ‘Resident’ or ‘Permit’, select the Emirate that has issued the visa, and the enter file number.• UDB Number or Emirates Unified Number• Emirates ID number• Passport Number – Enter your nationality and passport number.4. Enter your date of birth.5. Select your gender.6. Click on the ‘I’m not a robot’ captcha and click on the ‘Submit’ button.7. Next, you will be informed by GDRFA-Dubai if your record is registered. If it is, GDRFA-Dubai website will state – ‘Record is registered. You can use Smart Gates.’Once you have found out that you are registered to use Smart Gates, here is how to use it:1. Enter the Smart Gate, which is a separate section at passport control, and stand on the ‘foot’ sign.2. Next, remove anything covering your face, such as masks, glasses and hats. Your boarding pass and passport should be at hand if required.3. Then look at the green light on top of the camera to verify your biometrics and follow the instructions on the screen.4. Once your biometrics are approved, the Smart Gates will open, and your passport control process is done.For some UAE residents, once registered, you don’t need to scan your passport or Emirates ID at the Smart Gate.

10 Eerie predictions from history that shockingly came true,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/10-eerie-predictions-from-history-that-shockingly-came-true/articleshow/121690444.cms,"

From Wi-Fi to World War, predictions that came true across the world

1. The Cold War- Alexis de Tocqueville (1840)

2. His own death- Mark Twain (1909)

3. Wireless communication- Nikola Tesla (Early 1900s)

4. World War II- Ferdinand Foch (1919)



5. Photo and colour technology- John Elfreth Watkins (1900)



6. Organ transplants- Robert Boyle (Mid-17th Century)

7. The Moon landing- Jules Verne (1865)

8. The Titanic disaster- Morgan Robertson (1898)

9. Satellite communications- Arthur C. Clarke (1945)

10. Smartphones and AI assistants- Ray Kurzweil (Early 1990s)





Predictions have fascinated humanity for centuries, whether they came from prophets, scientists, or writers. While most forecasts miss the mark or fade into obscurity, a rare few have turned out to be incredibly accurate. These striking insights offered glimpses into the future that seemed almost too precise to believe. Some were rooted in deep observation, while others appeared to be the result of sheer intuition. From world wars and space travel to the internet and organ transplants, these predictions came true in ways that continue to amaze us today. Here are ten historical forecasts that remarkably became reality.French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville predicted the rise of two dominant global powers during his travels in the United States. In Democracy in America, he wrote that Russia and America would one day ""hold the destinies of half the world in their hands."" This seemed unlikely in the 19th century, but Tocqueville’s foresight was remarkable. His prediction came true during the Cold War era in the 20th century, when the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers locked in a tense global rivalry that shaped world politics for decades.Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, was born shortly after Halley’s Comet passed in 1835. In 1909, Twain made a striking prediction about his own death. He famously said, “I came in with Halley’s Comet… it is coming again, and I expect to go out with it.” This eerie prediction proved accurate when Twain died on April 21, 1910—just one day after the comet's return. His statement is often cited as one of the most personal and accurate prophecies ever made by a public figure.Nikola Tesla was far ahead of his time in predicting the future of communication technology. In 1909, he envisioned a world where wireless messages could be transmitted easily and widely, so simple that anyone could own and operate their own device. Tesla also described a “global brain” connected by wireless networks, anticipating the modern internet. His remarkable foresight paved the way for mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and other wireless technologies that have become essential to everyday life, transforming the way people communicate, access information, and interact worldwide.French general Ferdinand Foch expressed deep concerns over the Treaty of Versailles, signed after World War I. He believed the treaty was far too lenient on Germany and warned that it was not a true peace but merely an armistice that would last twenty years. His fears were tragically realized in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, triggering World War II. Foch’s statement showed his sharp understanding of the political realities and tensions that would soon escalate into another devastating global conflict just two decades after the end of the first.In 1900, engineer John Elfreth Watkins published an article titled What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years. He made several striking predictions, including the ability to “telegraph photographs from any distance,” foreseeing real-time image sharing and live broadcasts. Watkins also anticipated the development of full-color photography at a time when black-and-white photos were the norm. His vision accurately forecasted technological advances that have since revolutionized media, communication, and entertainment, shaping how people capture and share moments in vibrant color and instant detail.Robert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry, imagined future medical breakthroughs long before they were possible. Among his scientific hopes was the “cure of diseases by transplantation,” despite having no scientific basis or technology to achieve this at the time. Nearly three centuries later, Boyle’s vision became reality when the first successful human kidney transplant was performed in 1954. His foresight reflects the spirit of scientific progress—anticipating life-saving treatments that continue to evolve and transform modern medicine today.Jules Verne’s science fiction novel From the Earth to the Moon described a manned mission to the moon launched from Florida. The story included a capsule called the “Columbiad,” carrying three astronauts who splashed down in the ocean upon return. Verne’s imaginative details were astonishingly accurate. Exactly 100 years later, NASA’s Apollo 11 mission launched from Florida with a spacecraft called “Columbia,” a crew of three astronauts, and a splashdown recovery in the ocean. His visionary writing remains a remarkable example of fiction predicting reality.In his novella Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan, Morgan Robertson eerily described the sinking of an “unsinkable” giant ship named Titan, which struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic. The story included details such as a lack of enough lifeboats, resulting in massive loss of life. Fourteen years after the novella’s publication, the real Titanic met almost the exact same fate in 1912. The parallels between Robertson’s fictional ship and the Titanic’s disaster continue to fascinate and shock readers and historians alike.In 1945, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed using geostationary satellites to enable global communications. At the time, this idea was purely theoretical. Clarke’s vision became the blueprint for modern satellite technology, which today supports GPS navigation, television broadcasts, and worldwide internet connectivity. The orbit Clarke described is now known as the “Clarke Orbit,” and his prediction helped shape the way people around the world communicate and access information from space-based systems.Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil foresaw a future where people would carry portable devices connected to a global network, offering real-time information and voice interaction. In the early 1990s, Kurzweil predicted the rise of smartphones and AI-powered digital assistants like Siri and Alexa. Today, these technologies are a part of everyday life, transforming communication, productivity, and personal convenience. His predictions highlight how artificial intelligence and mobile computing continue to reshape society in profound ways.","Predictions have fascinated humanity for centuries, whether they came from prophets, scientists, or writers.

Can high tech boost safety?

'Contact us'?

Less religion, more cyber





This year, it's drones featuring thermal imaging and robots handing out religious advice.A decade ago, it was all about the miracle of the mobile phone. And a century or so ago, the motor car was the highest of high-tech used during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.The Hajj, one of the largest gatherings of humans on Earth, is meant to be undertaken by every adult Muslim once in their lifetime. It will begin in Saudi Arabia on June 4 and end June 9. During those days, up to 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries will take part in a number of different religious ceremonies in Mecca.But having so many people moving around in one comparatively small area has led to problems in the past. Thousands of pilgrims were killed in stampeding crowds in 1990 and 2015. Last year over 1,300 died due to extreme heat; pilgrims often walk up to 65 kilometers a day in 40-to-50 degrees Celsius heat. There have also been fires, protests, suicides, collapsing buildings and infectious diseases at the Hajj, as well as more everyday problems like people getting lost or having health problems.No wonder then that the Saudi authorities are trying to use technology to improve how they control crowds and cater to their visitors.This year, Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging as well as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to ensure that only those who have Hajj permits are allowed in.Last year's many deaths were mostly of pilgrims who didn't have official permission to be there and therefore couldn't access services like air-conditioned shelter in the extreme heat.To avoid overcrowding, Saudi Arabia's Nusuk website, also a mobile phone application, allows attendees to register to enter certain areas at allotted times. The Nusuk system includes an electronic identity card and a smart wristband, which hold information on the user's identity, travel plans, finances, health and accommodation, among other things. The Nusuk card must be carried throughout the pilgrimage and is used to access transport and other services. Some of the wristbands have location tracking, monitor the wearer's blood oxygen levels and heart rate, and can even be used to call for medical help.Other technological advances at this year's Hajj include robots to guide visitors around religious sites and to hand out water, Korans or offer advice in 11 languages. There are also newly paved, more reflective (and therefore cooler) streets, paths that minimize vibration for walking comfort, and a special white pilgrim's gown made from futuristic fabric that keeps the wearer up to 2 degrees Celsius cooler.All the technology, surveillance and advanced algorithmic calculation is meant to make the event safer and the chance of tragic accidents less likely. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy, state surveillance and potential cybercrime.""All of these technologies are mandatory and those who refuse them are not allowed to perform the pilgrimage,"" explains Zeinab Ismail, a researcher and editor at the Lebanon-based digital rights organization, SMEX. ""All of this, combined with Saudi Arabia's personal data protection law, which only partially aligns with international standards and contains concerning provisions and loopholes, raises increasing concerns about the safety and privacy of pilgrims' data. ""Saudi officials have argued that privacy concerns must outweigh safety at such a huge event.""Regardless of the [Saudi government's] justification, what worries me the most — and irrespective of the technology itself — is the fact that this technology is being deployed in a country where rule of law is weak, there's no transparency and no [state] accountability,"" argues Marwa Fatafta, policy director for the Middle East and North Africa at international digital rights organization, Access Now.It would be difficult to audit the technologies for problems and even harder for individuals to question their use, Fatafta told DW.""For the people who are going to the Hajj pilgrimage, they're not in any position to push back and say, 'I don't want to give my biometric data',"" she continued. ""So just the general context means that the door is wide open for abuse.""Reading the Nusuk app's terms and conditions, information about how long pilgrims' personal data can be kept is vague and even contradictory. DW e-mailed Saudi Arabia's National Data Management Office and the supervising Saudi Data and AI Authority to ask for more information on this. Both organizations publish e-mail addresses for the public to use if they have questions or want to make a complaint.Two DW e-mails received no response. Another bounced back with the message: ""Recipient's mailbox is full.""Since 2023, Saudi Arabia has had a personal data protection law — but as Ismail pointed out, ""the current legal framework … allows legislation to be interpreted or manipulated in ways that may serve state interests over human rights.""It's not just potential misuse of millions of pilgrims' data by local authorities causing concern. Higher dependence on technology to monitor and control Hajj pilgrims also means more vulnerability in general, as there are more places for hackers to attack. And Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are already some of the biggest victims of cybercrime.The first platform Saudi Arabia used for registering pilgrims, Motawif, was run by a private company and unexpectedly sent spam to users. The state-run Nusuk app replaced it in 2022. The following year, cybersecurity experts found data submitted to Nusuk for sale on illicit websites that deal in stolen personal data.New technology has also brought another worry: Is all that high tech taking away from the once-in-a-lifetime spiritual relevance of the Hajj?A 2018 study conducted by researchers at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK suggested it might be.Pilgrims interviewed for the study complained about others taking selfies at holy sites, talking on the phone while performing rituals and behaving like tourists rather than pious visitors. ""Smartphones are the fourth devil in Hajj,"" one interviewee said, referring to a ritual featuring three representations of the devil.Some even complained all the technology was making the journey too easy.Where once pilgrims walked between holy sites, now they ride a high-speed train. And where once they stayed in simple tents, now they're accommodated in 10,000 air-conditioned, fire-resistant tents.""Since the Hajj has become 'high-tech,' the fundamental spirituality of the pilgrim's experience is arguably being transformed into something more akin to a 'cyber experience',"" the UK researchers wrote. Traditionally the Hajj is meant to be all about simplicity, spiritual purity and contemplative worship, they explained.As with every other kind of digital technology, high tech at the Hajj had its benefits and disadvantages, they concluded.","Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging and facial recognition to control Hajj crowds. Pilgrims will also wear smart wristbands that monitor their health and can call for help. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy and cybercrime.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121620942,imgsize-887447,width-400,resizemode-4/121620942.jpg"

The UAE’s Midday Break regulation will be enforced once again this summer, from June 15 to September 15, 2025, to protect workers from extreme heat during peak afternoon hours. Outdoor work under direct sunlight is banned from 12:30pm to 3:00pm during this period, under strict guidelines issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE).Now in its 21st consecutive year, the Midday Break reflects the UAE’s sustained commitment to worker welfare, environmental sustainability, and international occupational health standards. The initiative is designed to prevent heat-related injuries and illnesses during the hottest months of the year.Mohsin Ali Al Nassi, Assistant Undersecretary for Inspection and Compliance at MoHRE, noted that the initiative has maintained over 99% compliance in recent years.MoHRE will continue on-site inspections and awareness drives at both work sites and labour accommodations, to make sure employers and employees fully understand their rights and obligations under this seasonal regulation.Dalal Alshehhi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for Labour Protection, praised the private sector’s proactive contributions:She also encouraged companies to install air-conditioned rest areas and improve workplace conditions during the midday break, noting their positive impact on productivity and worker wellbeing.To meet MoHRE’s Midday Break regulations, employers must provide:These provisions ensure workers remain safe and healthy not only during the break but also while performing tasks allowed under regulated conditions.Some work activities are exempt due to technical constraints or public safety concerns.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Updates on Apple Intelligence

Likely hardware announcements at WWDC 2025

Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025, promising a week of groundbreaking software announcements that will shape the future of its ecosystem. Running through June 13, the event will feature a keynote from Apple CEO Tim Cook at 10 a.m. PT (10.30 pm IST), streamed on Apple’s website, Developer app, and YouTube channel, alongside an in-person experience for select developers at Apple Park. Like every year, the event will be big on software.With the tagline “Sleek Peek,” WWDC 2025 will see updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, with a focus on design and AI integration. The headline announcement is expected to be a redesign of Apple’s operating systems, potentially rebranded with a year-based naming scheme: iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Reports suggest iOS 26 will undergo its most significant overhaul since iOS 7, introducing a unified design language with floating tab views, updated iconography, and glass-like UI effects inspired by the Vision Pro’s aesthetic. This cohesive look aims to rival Google’s Android 16 revamp, prioritizing fluidity and personalization across devices.Apple Intelligence, introduced in 2024, will see further enhancements, though not as the centerpiece. Rumors indicate Apple will open its Foundation Models to third-party developers, enabling custom AI-powered features in apps like Safari and Photos, which may be quietly rebranded as “AI-powered.” A long-awaited Siri overhaul remains in development but is unlikely to debut fully. Additionally, an AI-powered coding tool, possibly in partnership with Anthropic, could be introduced for Xcode, streamlining app development.iPadOS 26 may introduce a “Pro” version with advanced multitasking, improved external display support, and professional-grade apps, catering to power users. watchOS 26 is expected to support third-party Control Center widgets, while tvOS 26 could feature a revamped CarPlay UI and animated lock screen artwork. visionOS 26 may bring native support for gaming controllers like PlayStation and Xbox, alongside minor UI tweaks to bolster Apple’s spatial computing push.Hardware announcements are less likely, as Apple’s recent M4 MacBook Air release and focus on fall hardware events suggest a software-driven WWDC. However, speculation persists about a potential M4 Ultra chip reveal or Mac Pro updates, though these are considered long shots.Developers will have access to over 100 technical sessions, online labs, and one-on-one consultations with Apple experts, covering topics like Swift, machine learning, and AR/VR tools. The Swift Student Challenge will also spotlight emerging talent, with 50 Distinguished Winners invited to a three-day Apple Park experience.As Apple aims to balance innovation with its privacy-first ethos, WWDC 2025 is set to lay the groundwork for a smarter, more cohesive ecosystem, with iOS 26 leading the charge. Stay tuned for live updates as Apple unveils its vision for the future.","Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025.
