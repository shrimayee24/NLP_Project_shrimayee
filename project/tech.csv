Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama and speculation to an already chaotic story.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","Gabriella Zuniga is a 20-year-old OnlyFans model.

"Watch: Author Jillian Lauren, wife of Weezer bassist, shot in armed confrontation with Los Angeles police",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-author-jillian-lauren-wife-of-weezer-bassist-shot-in-armed-confrontation-with-los-angeles-police/articleshow/120659221.cms,"Northeast Area OIS 4/8/2025 (NRF012-25)

Los Angeles police released footage showing the armed confrontation in which author Jillian Lauren , wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner , was shot during a chaotic encounter in the Eagle Rock neighbourhood earlier this month.Lauren, 51, sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the April 8 incident, which unfolded as officers from the Los Angeles Police Department and the California Highway Patrol searched for three suspects who had fled a car crash nearby. Identified by authorities as Jillian Lauren Shriner, she was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and later released on a $1 million bond. She is expected to appear in court on April 30.LAPD on Friday made public body camera recordings, backyard surveillance footage, and 911 dispatch audio related to the shooting. The video shows officers shouting over the noise of a helicopter, warning Lauren to drop her weapon. A high wooden fence blocks a clear view, but an officer can be heard saying, “Ma'am, we're trying to help you. Put the gun down. You're going to get shot. It's the police.”Moments later, an officer notes, “Oh, she racked it,” referring to the cocking of a firearm, immediately followed by the sound of at least six gunshots.Separate silent surveillance footage shows Lauren barefoot, holding a pistol as she exits her home. Another clip captures her lifting the gun before dirt appears to kick up at her feet, prompting her to retreat toward her house.Further bodycam footage shows Lauren lying on the road, with officers handcuffing her and mentioning a wound on her arm.Jillian Lauren is known for her bestselling memoirs Some Girls: My Life in a Harem (2010) and Everything You Ever Wanted (2015). Her husband Scott Shriner joined Weezer, the popular Los Angeles-based band famed for their 1994 ""Blue Album,"" in the early 2000s.","Jillian Lauren, 51, sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the April 8 incident.

Most apps today have become unusable. They bombard users with irritating notifications, spam messages, and dark patterns, and many are downright scammy.

Without your knowledge, numerous apps on your phone track and harvest extensive data: which apps you've installed, how you use them, the content of your emails and SMS, media on your device, and more.

What's truly disturbing is that some apps track usage not just within their own environment but across other apps too. This means your most personal data is being harvested without your consent and sold to companies for shady targeting purposes.

At @zerodhaonline, we're different. We only request app permissions that are genuinely necessary for functionality. We don't send unnecessary push notifications, messages, or emails. We don't peddle useless financial products or push you to trade for the sake of ""engagement.""

Not doing unto others what we don't want done unto us is deeply rooted in our philosophy.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been confronted with various challenges on his path to turning a garage business into one of the biggest companies in the world. During his early days, Bezos faced doubts from investors and the public regarding the potential of e-commerce. He grappled with scarce resources and stiff competition from traditional retailers. As Amazon expanded, Bezos encountered logistical and operational challenges in expanding the business worldwide, keeping customers satisfied, and making timely deliveries.Despite these challenges, his vision, risk-taking attitude, and single-minded obsession with customer experience enabled him to turn Amazon into a global technology giant. Explore some of the major challenges being faced by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and how he overcame them.One of Jeff Bezos's most infamous failures is the Amazon Fire Phone, released in 2014 was Amazon's initial foray into the smartphone industry, challenging titans Apple and Samsung. The phone came equipped with flashy technology such as Dynamic Perspective (a 3D-like motion interface) and Firefly (a feature that could scan objects in the real world to immediately purchase them on Amazon). Though ambitious, the phone was obviously made more to promote purchasing than to offer a fantastic mobile experience. Consumers found it gimmicky, pricey, and without essential features. Large app makers avoided it, and the phone became obsolete in no time. Amazon had to drop its price from $199 to 99 cents within months and eventually wrote off $170 million worth of unsold goods. The Fire Phone flopped so badly that it retarded Amazon's hardware plans — but Bezos took it in stride, terming it as a necessary failure along the innovation path.Amazon in 2020 launched ""Crucible,"" its first AAA multiplayer video game. It was one of a series of moves by Bezos to make Amazon a gaming industry powerhouse. Created by Amazon Game Studios, Crucible was destined to be a huge success, rivaling such games as Fortnite and Overwatch. But the initial release was nothing short of calamitous. Unfocused, littered with errors, and a failure to pull in a fan base, only one month post-launch did the game get put back into closed beta — unheard of in video games — and a few more months later it was outright cancelled. Although the precise cost of development wasn't disclosed, typical AAA games are in the order of $60–$80 million, a significant reputational and financial loss. Though there was a failure, Amazon went on investing in other games as well, such as the ultimately successful ""New World,"" indicating Bezos's failure-to-learn strategy.Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway launched Haven in 2018 as an ambitious joint venture. It was intended to transform American healthcare for the workers of the companies and eventually, possibly, the general market. The vision was to lower the cost of healthcare and enhance results through technology and innovation — classic Bezos thinking. But the healthcare system was too complicated. The company faced fuzzy objectives, leadership turnover, and minimal concrete progress. By early 2021, Haven quietly closed. It never rolled out a product or shook up the system as intended. For Bezos, this was a stark reminder that even ambitious, well-capitalized projects can fail when attempting to reform industries with entrenched inefficiencies.During the dot-com bubble, Bezos invested big in startups that shared Amazon's ecommerce vision. One of the largest flops was Pets.com, in which Amazon had a large stake. Launched with great fanfare — including a Super Bowl commercial that starred a sock puppet — the company vowed to bring pet supplies to your doorstep. But the business model was flawed: shipping heavy pet food was costly, and the company sold it at little markup and with free shipping. As losses accumulated, confidence dwindled. When the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Pets.com folded. Amazon lost millions in the process, and the sock puppet became a lasting symbol of dot-com failure. Bezos admitted the error but attributed it to a risk necessary in pushing the limits of ecommerce.Another dot-com failure investment was Kozmo.com, which guaranteed one-hour delivery of items such as DVDs, snacks, and magazines. Amazon invested more than $60 million in it, thinking ultra-fast delivery was the future. Kozmo's product was novel but unsustainable — no minimum order quantity, and free delivery. The firm grew too rapidly and went out of money. It collapsed in 2001. The irony is that this same concept — speedy delivery — would later prove to be one of Amazon's greatest assets in the form of Prime. But at the time, the infrastructure was not in place, and Bezos's dream was premature.Amazon's initial serious foray into the peer-to-peer payments market, WebPay, was introduced in 2009. It enabled users to send money from their Amazon accounts, going head-to-head with companies such as PayPal. However, the service failed to gain traction. Its interface was awkward, and consumers had no incentive to move from more established sites. Amazon closed it down by 2014. The failure demonstrated that even with the Amazon name behind it, badly implemented financial tools wouldn't work without actual innovation or consumer incentive.According to the reports, Amazon invested $175 million in LivingSocial, a daily deals site intended to compete with Groupon, in 2010. Early on, the business expanded briskly, but the daily deal format started declining. LivingSocial attempted to revamp by providing tickets to events and staging experiences in neighborhoods, even going as far as expending millions redeveloping an historic building into a venue. Those efforts could not revive expansion. LivingSocial was purchased in 2016 by Groupon for zero dollars — $0. Amazon's investment in terms of large dollars was gone, and the arrangement was broadly agreed upon as not succeeding.In 2014, Amazon tried to rival Square and PayPal with its own payment device: the Amazon Local Register. It was an app and card reader designed for small businesses. But it didn't catch on — the device didn't have competitive features, and small business owners didn't use it. Amazon discontinued it in 2015 and closed it down completely in 2016. Similar to WebPay, it demonstrated that entering a space without a clear benefit to the user wouldn't be sufficient to capture market share.Askville, introduced in 2007, was Amazon's take on Yahoo! Answers or Quora — a Q&A site where users could pose questions and receive community answers. While it amassed a respectable user base, it never really found its market or achieved mainstream fame. As years went by, Amazon lost enthusiasm for keeping it going, and in 2013 the site was closed. The endeavour never merged with Amazon's overall business and is today a relic of its early Web 2.0 days.It debuted in 2015, and Amazon Destinations was Amazon's foray into the travel sector by providing short getaway hotel bookings. But the site had no competitive offers, didn't provide flights, and wasn't sufficiently enticing to shake up large travel websites such as Expedia or Booking.com. In a mere six months, Amazon shut it down. Bezos never made a public comment on the failure, but it was a textbook example of a company attempting to reach too far beyond its area of expertise without providing something new or better.Amazon's flash fashion sale website, MyHabit, opened in 2011 as flash-sale retailers such as Gilt and Rue La La gained popularity. It was designed to provide fashion enthusiasts time-limited offers on high-end clothing and accessories. But the idea didn't pan out as shoppers grew weary of flash sales, and competition within the fashion sector increased. MyHabit was discontinued in 2016, with Amazon choosing instead to merge clothing sales under the Amazon Fashion banner. It was a move away from niche fashion experiments, but a shift towards wider, long-term thinking.In 2009, Amazon removed unauthorised copies of George Orwell's ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" from customers' Kindles remotely. While the move was within the law — the books were available for sale by a third-party who did not have the right to distribute them — it generated public outcry. The removal of content from individuals' devices was itself Orwellian in nature, and critics charged Amazon with digital censorship. Bezos apologised in person, labeling the action ""stupid, thoughtless, and painfully out of line with our principles."" The affair hurt trust in Kindle and made clear the dangers of digital overreach.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been confronted with various challenges on his path to turning a garage business into one of the biggest companies in the world.

Elon Musk criticism of OpenAI’s for-profit status

Podcaster Rob Wiblin recently shared a post highlighting a legal letter titled 'Not For Private Gain', signed by 3 Nobel Prize winners and dozens of AI researchers, accusing OpenAI of illegally restructuring from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. Sent to California and Delaware Attorneys General, the letter allegedly demands halting the restructuring of the company. X owner and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk replied to the post, calling it “scam of the century”.The post also has screenshots of the letter with the following text highlighted in colour: All of the governance safeguards that Mr. Altman claimed “ensure (OpenAI) remains focused on its long-term mission would be in jeopardy”. It also has a table comparing the current governance safeguards of OpenAI (under its nonprofit structure) with the proposed changes under the for-profit restructuring.Founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit. The company, as per reports plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation, a shift that has raised concerns among AI experts, legal scholars and former OpenAI employees. They argue that the move could compromise OpenAI’s original mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of all humanity.Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI has been a vocal critic of this transition. He has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI that will go to a jury trial in spring 2026. The lawsuit, initially dismissed, accuses OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman of deviating from its founding agreement by emphasizing profits over AI safety .","OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Jason Kelce trades football for fashion, promoting U.S.-made clothing during rising global trade tensions

Jason Kelce banks on patriotism and quality craftsmanship for Underdog's success

Jason Kelce stays neutral but taps into America First energy to launch Underdog

Jason Kelce , the legendary former center for the Philadelphia Eagles , is making waves off the field with the launch of his new fashion venture, Underdog — a clothing line dedicated to American-made products. As global markets react to Donald Trump’s escalating trade war, Kelce’s timing couldn’t be sharper, positioning Underdog as a symbol of “America First” manufacturing pride.In an interview with The New York Times , Kelce made it clear that his move isn't intended to be political. ""I have no issues with global trade whatsoever,"" he emphasized. ""There's some really awesome reasons to support homegrown American businesses."" The 37-year-old NFL veteran stressed that his real motivation lies in boosting domestic industries and offering consumers high-quality, U.S.-crafted apparel.Kelce’s Underdog brand is all about authenticity. Every T-shirt and sweatshirt is entirely produced in the United States, from cotton sourcing to final stitching. Reflecting on his transition from football to fashion, Kelce shared, ""The most satisfying part is that the clothing is completely made in America,"" showcasing his commitment to sustainability and domestic job creation.Best known for his larger-than-life presence both on the field and through the wildly popular New Heights podcast with brother Travis Kelce, Jason is now channeling that same passion into building a brand that stands for something greater. According to Spotify data, New Heights draws in an impressive 2 million listeners each week — and many of those loyal fans are rallying behind his latest endeavor.Social media users quickly praised the move. One fan tweeted, ""Kelce's Underdog brand is peak America First!"" while another observed, ""Kelce's playing it smart with Underdog — tariffs are a nightmare,"" referencing the skyrocketing retail prices due to Trump's aggressive trade policies.While tariffs like Trump’s new 200% threat on companies like John Deere have roiled the economy, Kelce’s fully American-made approach helps Underdog dodge rising import costs. His team confirmed that Underdog’s first batch of products — priced at $45 for T-shirts and $79 for sweatshirts — will be available on the brand’s website in May 2025.Despite his past praise of Trump’s 2024 Eagles-Steelers game appearance, Kelce remains politically neutral, preferring to focus on action rather than slogans.

Oliver Moore, Sam Rinzel, and Ryan Greene make their first impressions in the NHL

Oliver Moore , Sam Rinzel , and Ryan Greene are quite reassuring in their debut, giving the Chicago Blackhawks a breath of fresh air and hope for a rebuilding phase. With the organization's concentration on youth development, these young ones are already making their mark at the NHL level. The Blackhawks still have an enormous distance to cover, but the emergence of these stars provides the fans with some relief that a strong resurgence is just around the corner: Chicago's new era seems to be fast taking shape.The dying embers of the 2024-25 regular season provided an excellent stage for Oliver Moore and Sam Rinzel to show some talent, each playing in nine games. Moore's speed and attacking instincts made him an instant fit for the breathtaking pace and physicality of NHL competition. Impressive skating ability and offensive flair could shine even brighter with some time spent polishing him down in the minors next year, all the while leaving a little similarity in the runway between him and Frank Nazar, back then able to thrive just after part-time AHL exposure.In contrast, Sam Rinzel's transition seemed even smoother. The big right-handed defenseman exhibited poise and an advanced defensive game as he handled responsibilities on the top-most defensive pair for the Blackhawks. With his calm puck movement and confident demeanor on the ice, Rinzel appeared to have no intention of spending lengthy time in the minors and would soon be a contender for full-time NHL duty.Ryan Greene also made two appearances and left a good impression. Greene has a smart two-way game and good hockey sense, and he showed that after a full AHL season, he is ready to start competing for a permanent position in the Chicago lineup. His first view was that of a player with great long-term value in the club's thinking.While Moore, Rinzel, and Greene start up the very front of the first wave of young talent, the Blackhawks' pipeline remains a flow of riches. Lardis, Boisvert, and Kantserov have spent the last year getting real working experience in various leagues with the intention of churning out the next wave of young energy for the organization to consume. Every little success is building into the vision of sustainable rebuilding by the Blackhawks.Also Read: Chicago Blackhawks rebuild: Connor Bedard, Korchinski, and the next core taking shape Early flashes of brilliance from Oliver Moore, Sam Rinzel, and Ryan Greene provide the Chicago Blackhawks with a solid foundation for future aspirations.

The battle for attention: GTA 6 vs Ghost of Yōtei



What does this mean for Ghost of Yōtei’s success?



With Ghost of Yōtei, the next installment of the much-anticipated Ghost of Tsushima series, set to drop on October 2, 2025, it faces off directly against one of gaming's most hotly anticipated releases of all time, Grand Theft Auto VI. Both games are penciled in to arrive in the same fall window, which means this confrontation represents a key date in the gaming schedule. With all the hype for GTA 6 , Ghost of Yōtei will have to fight hard to find its footing.GTA 6 has fast become a cultural phenomenon, with fans eagerly awaiting the next huge release from Rockstar Games . Its influence on the gaming landscape is set to be colossal, with some predicting it could be one of the decade's largest entertainment releases. Based in a realistic, open-world setting replete with interactive storytelling and next-generation gameplay, GTA 6 is set to take headlines and capture millions of players globally.However, the Ghost of Yōtei has its own distinct charm. Being a stealth-action samurai game, it presents a distinct genre experience from GTA 6's crime drama. Sucker Punch Productions develops the game and carries the lineage of the much-acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima, which itself received widespread acclaim for its visuals, innovative fighting mechanics, and rich storytelling. However, the challenge for Ghost of Yōtei lies in launching in the shadow of GTA 6's cultural and media dominance.While Ghost of Yōtei boasts an exclusive PlayStation 5 release, which gives it an advantage in attracting a dedicated fanbase, the fierce competition from GTA 6 could affect its visibility. The GTA 6 juggernaut will likely dominate social media, gaming forums, and news outlets, making it difficult for other releases to shine as brightly. Yet, Ghost of Yōtei’s unique setting and gameplay mechanics may still attract PlayStation fans eager for a different kind of experience, particularly those who prefer narrative-driven, single-player adventures.With a dedicated fan base, a specific genre niche, and being released exclusively on PlayStation 5, Ghost of Yōtei has the ingredients to stay in the limelight. But, during the busy fall release period, its success will highly be dependent on how effective it is in separating itself from GTA 6's shadow.The autumn of 2025 promises to be one of gaming's most competitive times, with GTA 6 and Ghost of Yōtei both competing for the spotlight. Though GTA 6's reign is all but guaranteed, Ghost of Yōtei might find some niche among PlayStation users. It will be worth watching what these two titans do as they vie for attention.Also Read: GTA 6: Insider Tom Henderson speculates official news could arrive ahead of Take-Two earnings call","Ghost of Yōtei, the next installment of the much-anticipated Ghost of Tsushima series, is set to drop on October 2, 2025.
