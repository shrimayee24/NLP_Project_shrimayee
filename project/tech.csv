Elon Musk’s xAI studio aims to create innovative AI-generated video games



Experts warn AI content creation cannot match human creativity and vision



Musk’s Grok aims for AI movies while raising copyright and ethical concerns

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation.

It was meant to be a celebratory day for Eric Trump, but it turned into an awkward moment on social media.US President Donald Trump proudly announced the release of his son’s new memoir, ""Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,"" on Truth Social, urging his followers to “get a copy” of what he called a “phenomenal book. ” He wrote, “Don’t forget to get a copy of my son Eric’s book, ‘UNDER SIEGE,’ which is breaking records everywhere. It’s a phenomenal book, that’s a must read for everyone—Congratulations Eric, you deserve it!!!”However, while the POTUS promoted the memoir online, his son’s in-person book signing told a different story. Eric posted a video from a bookstore in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, inviting people to pick up signed copies of his book. “Bunch of signed books here, first come first serve,” he said. “Come over to Barnes and Noble, Palm Beach Gardens, a bunch of signed books.”Social media users were quick to notice that the store appeared empty.Netizens started mocking the turnout, with one user commenting, “Looks empty,” and another saying, “No one has been waiting for you.” One quipped, “You couldn’t write a postcard, buddy,” while another added, “Your family had Gaza under siege and now you have our rights and freedoms under siege. That what this is about?”Eric Trump’s book retails for $22 and claims to offer “an unfiltered look at the highs and lows of life in the Trump world,” featuring stories from the campaign trail, The Celebrity Apprentice boardroom, and the Trump Organization.It also includes a foreword written by his father.However, Under Siege climbed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller chart on Tuesday, sharing the spotlight with 107 Days, a memoir by former US vice president Kamala Harris.Earlier in the month, Eric had faced backlash during his press tour when he appeared to promote the book while paying tribute to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","US President Donald Trump announced the release of his son's new memoir, ""Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,"" on Truth Social.

BRUSSELS: The EU Friday demanded digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm, as all but two member states signalled openness to restricting social media access for minors.The European Union has stringent rules regulating the digital space, including what children should be able to see, but there is increasing concern that more needs to be done. Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",EU demands digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.

Creates a vital bridge between local designers, international buyers, media, and key investors.

Highlights the Kingdom's dedication to preserving its cultural legacy while fearlessly embracing modernity and sustainability.





Riyadh, get ready to sashay! The city’s biggest fashion week is about to turn up the heat with Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, two style legends are set to headline the event, promising jaw-dropping designs, cultural fusion, and sustainable glamour like never before.Riyadh Fashion Week 2025 is not just another event on the fashion calendar; it's a bold statement. From October 16 to 21, the Saudi capital transforms into a sartorial playground, featuring over 30 runway shows, designer presentations, and citywide activations. This year's edition marks a significant milestone as it welcomes international fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney to the Kingdom's fashion stage for the first time.The style revolution kicks off on October 16 with a show that's pure, electric fusion: the Middle Eastern runway debut of Vivienne Westwood. But this isn't just a transplant of a London catwalk. In a move that brilliantly honors local artistry, the house is collaborating with Art of Heritage by Princess Noura Al Faisal.Imagine: iconic British punk aesthetics, the rebellious cuts, the historical references, the sheer attitude—set against the serene backdrop of a Riyadh palm grove.The collection will feature specially created embroidered gowns, a direct result of mixing Westwood's couture team's expertise with the exquisite craftsmanship of local Saudi artisans. It's a ""global-local"" philosophy brought to life, a powerful cultural exchange that doesn't just showcase fashion, but actively fosters and empowers Saudi heritage and craftsmanship for a global audience. Get ready for a breathtaking blend of anarchy and elegance.Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood (1941–2022) was not born into high society; she came from a working-class family in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, England. Her father worked as a storekeeper and her mother was a weaver. Westwood's achievements are marked by a unique blend of anarchy, historical reference, and activism. She defined the look of punk, introducing anti-establishment imagery, bondage gear, safety pins, and provocative slogans to fashion. After punk was co-opted, Westwood turned to history for inspiration. Her first official runway collection, 'Pirates' (1981), launched the ""New Romantic"" movement. Subsequent collections revived historical cuts like the bustle and the mini-crini, cementing her reputation as an innovator who fused history with contemporary rebellion.Bringing the spectacular week to a thoughtful and luxurious close on October 21 is the regional debut of Stella McCartney. As a pioneer of sustainable luxury, McCartney's presence underscores Saudi Arabia's bold step toward conscious creativity and an eco-friendly future in fashion.Her show will be a curated presentation of her recent and archival collections, a masterclass in fashion that proves you don't need to sacrifice animals or the planet for show-stopping style. From her famous commitment to cruelty-free materials to her innovative use of recycled and responsible fabrics, McCartney's finale is a powerful statement. Her debut cements Riyadh Fashion Week as a platform not only for style but for substance, emphasizing the Kingdom's commitment to building a modern fashion ecosystem rooted in ethical and future-facing values.Stella Nina McCartney CBE (born 1971) was born into a world of both celebrity and conscious living. She is the daughter of The Beatles' legendary singer-songwriter Sir Paul McCartney and the late American photographer and devoted animal rights activist, Linda McCartney. McCartney's career is defined by her unwavering commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainable innovation.While the international icons are drawing the global gaze, Riyadh Fashion Week remains fiercely dedicated to shining a brilliant light on the incredible talent thriving within the region. Over 30 runway shows and presentations will celebrate a diverse lineup that spans high couture, contemporary ready-to-wear, and street-smart menswear. Prepare to be wowed by established Saudi brands like the elegant couturiers Tima Abid and Atelier Hekayat, the sustainable chic of Abadia, the modern design of Hindamme, and the experimental streetwear of 1886. They'll share the stage with regional power players such as Waad AlOqaili, Ashwaq AlMarshad, Leem, Arwa Albanawi, Razan AlAzzouni, Mona AlShebil, and Reem AlKanhal.

Why this is different and what to expect next





Imagine your driving licence renewing itself, or bills getting paid before deadlines that’s what Abu Dhabi’s new AI-powered public servant TAMM AutoGov promises, marking a new era of proactive governance unveiled at GITEX 2025.At GITEX Global 2025, Abu Dhabi rolled out TAMM AutoGov, described by authorities as the world’s first transactional AI public servant a major upgrade to the TAMM super-app that lets government services act proactively on behalf of people. The launch is part of Abu Dhabi’s broader plan to become an “AI-native” government by 2027 and is presented as a move from reactive service delivery to “anticipatory governance. ”TAMM AutoGov is built to reduce routine friction by automating recurring tasks and offering proactive service prompts. Examples given by officials include renewing licenses, managing scheduled payments and completing multi-step transactions with user consent. Users can set personal preferences and choose automation levels — meaning the system could, with permission, complete some services for you before you ask.The aim is to make government touchpoints faster, personalised and less dependent on repeated manual requests.Why this matters in plain terms:Abu Dhabi’s rollout doesn’t stand alone — it’s backed by major industry partners and a strategic technology push. The Department of Government Enablement (DGE) is working with global vendors and local partners to embed AI and cloud infrastructure that meet sovereign security needs. Industry collaborations announced around the same time (including work with NVIDIA and Oracle on sovereign AI infrastructure) point to high-performance computing and cloud platforms powering these services. This combination aims to deliver scalable, secure AI services that handle sensitive public data while running complex models fast enough to enable real-time automation.An AI that acts for you raises immediate questions, consent, data use, transparency and error handling. Officials stress that TAMM will allow users to set automation levels and personal preferences, but citizens should still check:Because the initiative handles transactional public services, independent audits, clear opt-in flows, and human-in-the-loop safeguards will be crucial to trust and legal compliance. Abu Dhabi frames this program as secure and sovereign, but observers and residents should watch the published privacy policies, service-level commitments and any third-party audits.Abu Dhabi isn’t just adding a chatbot, it’s attempting systemic change: move public services from “respond when asked” to “anticipate and act.” If successful, the model could cut friction for routine tasks, improve uptake of entitlements, and reduce backlog in public services. Expect a staged rollout, early pilots for low-risk services, and growing visibility of the technology stack and governance safeguards as it expands. Keep an eye on future announcements about scope, third-party audits and how citizens can control or opt out of automation.","TAMM AutoGov is the world’s first transactional AI public servant.

Taj Mahal Noodles - “Taste of the Heritage”: Instant noodles with a picture of the Taj Mahal and a promise of “authentic Indian spices.” Tastes suspiciously like chicken ramen with coriander dreams.



Bollywood Pickle - Jar label: a dancing couple, tagline: “Spicy Like Cinema!” It’s mango achar that smells like a film set and tastes like drama.



Royal India Biscuits: Manufactured in Ajman, “imported from India” (questionable), these biscuits come in tins showing tigers and temples. The flavor? Vanilla-ish nostalgia.

Mysore Rose Body Lotion (Made in Oman) : Because nothing says “India” like an Omani lotion that smells like grandma’s wedding perfume.

Desi Detox Drink: Tulsi-Lemon-Chia Fusion, a modern miracle drink that no Indian has ever heard of, but every wellness influencer in Dubai swears is “ayurvedic.”

Indian Frozen foods that defy expectation

The Unlikely Suspects: You walk past the frozen Okra (Bhindi) and Drumsticks (because who has time to chop that ?), and then you see them: trays of Frozen Gajar ka Halwa (carrot pudding). Yes. A dessert that takes four hours of slow simmering is now a pop-it-in-the-microwave affair. Who buys this? Everyone.

The Tiffin Box Time Warp: Another unexpected hero is the individually packed, frozen 'Mini-Meals' or thalis . These aren't fancy; they're the food equivalent of a comfort blanket, containing exactly two rotis , a dollop of dal , and a generic vegetable curry. They exist because the alternative is spending your one weekend day cooking seven meals.

The Frozen Samosa Pyramid Scheme: The sheer volume of frozen samosas and kebabs sold in the UAE is a phenomenon in itself. They're sold in colossal, family-sized packs, often manufactured in a nearby country just to keep up with the overwhelming, year-round demand for instant, deep-fried comfort.

The unseen force: Why are people eating this?

The 9-to-5 Compromise: The biggest force is the Relentless Work Schedule. When you're working 9-to-5 (or 9-to-9) in Dubai, convenience trumps authenticity. It’s a choice between a 5-minute frozen thali and ordering another pricey takeaway. The freezer wins.

The UAE Logistics Mastermind: This is the ultimate comedy of the UAE market. If someone, somewhere, in the two million-strong Indian community, demands a frozen item, the market will find a way to import it, manufacture it, and stock it even if it's the most time-consuming dessert ever conceived. The demand is so high, it's a guaranteed profit. The market is literally bending to the will of nostalgia.

Weird demands from non-desi shoppers

The ""Mild Curry Powder"" Mission: Foreigners walk in demanding the ""safest, least spicy curry powder."" The staff, who measure chili heat on a scale that goes up to ""Volcanic Eruption,"" will hand them a bag labeled ""Daily Mild Masala,"" which is still spicy enough to activate a smoke alarm. The hilarious reality is that even the mildest option is a culinary challenge, reinforcing the idea that Indian food simply refuses to be truly bland.

The Search for 'The Sauce' : After eating pani puri on the street, tourists often return searching for the ""green liquid that tasted like mint and heaven."" They aren't looking for pudina chutney; they are looking for The Elixir of Life, and they can't quite describe the exact combination of herbs, tamarind, and chili required. The staff often just hand them a generic, slightly sweetened coriander sauce, knowing they'll never quite replicate the street vendor magic.

They often buy it out of pure curiosity, wondering why the cleaning aisle smells like a hospital.





Walk into any “Indian grocery” in the UAE, and you’ll instantly feel two things: nostalgia and mild cultural whiplash. The smell of cardamom and detergent hits you, Bollywood songs play from a small Bluetooth speaker, and you spot a pack labelled “Taj Mahal Pasta – Real Indian Taste. ”Wait… pasta? Taj Mahal ? Real Indian taste?Congratulations, you’ve entered the world of UAE’s Desi Grocery Oddities, where nostalgia meets marketing gone rogue, and half the shelves are stocked with items that would make your Indian relatives blink twice and whisper,There’s an entire aisle of “Made for expats” brands that existin the Gulf. They sound Indian, look Indian, but are as mysterious as Dubai rain. Here are some all-time classics you’ll find stacked neatly beside the Maggi packets:The frozen food aisle isn't just about ready-made butter chicken; it's a silent, brightly-lit gallery of culinary compromises and logistics marvels.

"Dubai to become first city outside US with Elon Musk’s Boring Company Loop system, 17 km phase 1 by 2026",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-to-become-first-city-outside-us-with-elon-musks-boring-company-loop-system-17-km-phase-1-by2026/articleshow/124545152.cms,"Dubai’s 17 km underground Loop by Elon Musk’s Boring Company promises fast, cool, futuristic rides, launch expected in 2026 / Images courtesy of official X posts from @rta_dubai and @boringcompany

What exactly is the Dubai loop?

Builder: The Boring Company (founded by Elon Musk in 2016)



(founded by Elon in 2016) Length (phase 1): ~17 km (10.6 miles)



Stations: ~11, including major commercial and residential hubs



Capacity: 20,000 pph initially



Speed: Up to 160 km/h (100 mph)



Expected opening: 2026



The big reveal: Who announced the Dubai loop and when

What is the Boring Company and Elon Musk’s role in the Dubai loop?

Founder & Visionary: Musk drives the concept, pushing for rapid innovation and testing unconventional transport methods.



Track Record: The company’s first major project, the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, operates a short route using Tesla pods. It serves as a prototype for larger city networks.



Dubai Loop Role: The Boring Company will construct and operate the initial 17 km network, design pods and stations, and integrate technology for safety and speed. Musk’s personal vision shapes ambitious timelines and futuristic features, like high-speed electric pods and minimal surface impact.



Why Dubai wants the loop: Solving heat, traffic, and time



Fast Commutes: Trips that take 30–60 minutes could drop to minutes.



Weather-Proof Transit: Underground tunnels mean no sun, no sand, no sweating.



Zero Emissions: Electric vehicles mean no pollution or noise.



Smart Integration: RTA plans to sync the Loop with Metro, tram, and bus systems for seamless connectivity.



Timeline and progress: How real is the 2026 goal?





Dubai’s daily traffic jams could soon be history. Elon Musk ’s Boring Company is digging deep to build the Dubai Loop, a 17-kilometre underground electric transit system slated for 2026. Announced by UAE’s AI Minister Omar Sultan Al Olama at GITEX 2025, the project aims to whisk commuters across the city in minutes, combining speed, sustainability, and sci-fi flair.Think of the Dubai Loop as a series of underground tunnels where small electric vehicles — Teslas or custom pods zip passengers through tubes at speeds up to 160 km/h (100 mph).Instead of heavy metro trains, these vehicles run continuously, aiming to transport about 20,000 passengers per hour in the first phase. Future expansions could scale that up to 100,000 passengers/hour as more tunnels are added.This system isn’t a metro replacement but a new layer of rapid micro-transit, designed to beat congestion, heat, and long commutes with zero emissions.The story broke when UAE’s Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Sultan Al Olama, revealed that Elon Musk’s The Boring Company is set to open the Dubai Loop in 2026. The announcement came during GITEX 2025, Dubai’s massive annual tech expo, where innovation headlines are the norm but this one stole the show.The minister highlighted that Dubai would be the first international city outside the United States to roll out The Boring Company’s Loop system, following its pilot in Las Vegas.Bloomberg first reported the statement on October 13, 2025, followed by Reuters, The National, and Gulf News confirming details through the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). According to the RTA, the initial route will span around 17 km and include 11 stations, forming the foundation for a wider city network.The Boring Company is a US-based infrastructure and tunnel construction firm founded by Elon Musk in 2016. Its mission is to reduce surface traffic congestion by building underground transportation tunnels for electric vehicles.Musk, known for Tesla and SpaceX, envisioned tunnels as a high-speed, climate-controlled alternative to traditional roads and metros, with smaller vehicles moving continuously instead of waiting for large trains.Key points about the company and Musk’s involvement:In short, Musk is the ideal driver, The Boring Company is the builder, and Dubai provides the bold canvas for the project’s international debut.Dubai’s roads are famously efficient but also famously busy. With rapid population growth, tourism influx, and scorching summers, the city faces three transport challenges: congestion, sustainability, and comfort.The Loop answers all three:It’s also an image play: Dubai wants to cement itself as the global capital of future mobility, joining flying taxis, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven public transport already in trials across the emirates.The official statement from the UAE minister sparked excitement but also skepticism. While The Boring Company has proven technology in Las Vegas’ Convention Center Loop, Dubai’s version is much larger and more complex. Still, the optimism from UAE officials signals strong government backing; a key success factor in Dubai’s mega projects.The Dubai Loop fits neatly into the UAE’s National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 and Smart Mobility Vision 2040, aiming to automate 25% of all trips through autonomous or AI-assisted transport. If successful, the Loop could slash surface congestion, create thousands of jobs in tunneling, AI, and operations, set a precedent for other GCC cities, and make Dubai a living laboratory for next-gen infrastructure. Behind it all is Elon Musk’s Boring Company, the visionary firm turning this futuristic concept into reality. Musk’s personal drive and the company’s tunneling expertise are central to making Dubai’s bold underground transit dream what they call “transport at the speed of thought”; a tangible reality.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has announced plans to build a 17 km underground electric transit system. The Boring Company, founded by Elon Musk in 2016, will build and operate the first 17 km network.

"UAE: Abu Dhabi unveils AI tools for early detection of diabetes, cancer and other chronic diseases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-abu-dhabi-unveils-ai-tools-for-early-detection-of-diabetes-cancer-and-other-chronic-diseases/articleshow/124534304.cms,"A diverse team of UAE healthcare professionals showcases advanced AI and holographic technology in a modern hospital.

AI language models: From 5th-Gen Warfare to Next-Gen Medicare.



Abu Dhabi’s three-pillar healthcare strategy

Malaffi: The next-gen healthcare ecosystem





Abu Dhabi is making significant strides in healthcare innovation with the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at predicting and preventing chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer. The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi (DoH) recently unveiled new AI-powered initiatives at GITEX Global 2025, as part of its vision to help residents live longer, healthier lives.One of the standout projects is the Next-Gen Wellness program, which combines wearable technology, AI-driven health analysis, and physician-led care to detect health risks early and promote personalized wellness plans. This program marks a shift from traditional reactive healthcare to a proactive model, where monitoring and intervention happen continuously. Complementing this is the Smart Healthcare Platform, a cloud-based digital system that facilitates real-time health interventions for better patient outcomes and better system efficiency.These innovations build on the foundation laid by Abu Dhabi’s widely acclaimed AI patient risk profiling system, which is now fully operational across all hospitals and clinics in the emirate and covers the entire population.This tool scrutinizes a person’s health records from birth and assesses the risk of developing 14 different diseases, including diabetes and various cancers. What sets this system apart is its ability to clearly explain the reasons behind risk scores, helping doctors make informed decisions and begin treatment early. Large language models embedded in the system assist physicians by quickly retrieving the most relevant patient information and even support patients through interactive AI-enabled tools available on the Sahatna app.Abu Dhabi’s healthcare transformation is guided by a three-pillar strategy focusing on longevity, best-in-class care, and system resilience. Ibrahim Al Jallaf, Executive Director of Digital Health at DoH Abu Dhabi, emphasized the importance of this approach at GITEX: “In Abu Dhabi we have something we call a patient risk profile. This looks for 14 different diseases, such as the probability of somebody getting diabetes or different types of cancers, and it tells the physician, based on the patient that's right in front of you, what is their probability of getting this disease… it informs the physician, and it also gives the physician more information — what lab tests, what recent visits gave the indication to the AI use case that this person has a medium probability of diabetes. ”He also highlighted the supportive role of AI, stating, “Artificial intelligence is there to support the physician. It's very important that we have explainability in the model... It doesn't act on behalf of the physician - instead, it allows the physician to use their knowledge and understanding.”Earlier efforts in the UAE focused heavily on AI-driven disease detection and risk management. Dubai’s EJADA AI platform, for instance, successfully analyzed millions of health records to identify people at high risk of diabetes, leading to a substantial reduction in treatment costs. Meanwhile, university-led research collaborations have deployed AI to discover new immunotherapy targets for diabetes and cancer by studying genes related to blood vessel cells, opening avenues for faster and more cost-effective treatments.The seamless sharing of data through Malaffi, the emirate’s health information exchange, ensures that medical professionals have access to a patient’s full medical history at every visit, supporting more precise and timely interventions. The emirate is also nurturing a truly collaborative innovation ecosystem, welcoming dynamic partnerships with global tech leaders and research institutes to pilot and scale impactful AI solutions. This strategically positions Abu Dhabi as a leading global testbed for smart healthcare technologies, set to benefit both local communities and broader global populations.The latest AI advancements in Abu Dhabi represent a major leap forward from earlier initiatives, moving beyond basic risk prediction to continuous wellness support and highly personalized treatment. This transformative approach is rapidly transforming healthcare delivery, enhancing physician capabilities, and steadily advancing Abu Dhabi’s mission to improve the health and longevity of its residents through groundbreaking innovation and technology.","The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi recently unveiled new AI-powered initiatives at GITEX Global 2025.

The Word You WANT to Say What Indians Often Say Why It Can Cause Trouble The Quick Fix! Qalb (Heart) Kalb (Sounds like 'K'ite) In Arabic, your Qalb (with a deep, guttural 'Q') is your heart. But if you say it with a soft 'K,' you've just said Kalb—which means Dog! Say the 'Q' from the very back of your throat. Think of it as a deep, rough 'K'. Khubz (Bread) Kubz (Skipping the 'kh') Khubz is the delicious local flatbread. If you drop the throat sound ('kh'), native speakers might not understand you. The 'kh' sound is like gently clearing your throat. Practice saying 'Kha-liji' (for the Gulf) to get the sound right! Ḥāl (Condition/State) Haal (Too much breath) You use this word for the universal greeting: Kayfa Ḥalak? (How are you?). The Arabic Ḥā’ (ح) is a soft, compressed 'h' sound. Keep your 'h' quiet and smooth. It's not a big, loud English 'H.' Marḥaba (Hello) Mar-HAA-baaa! (Too stressed) We tend to over-emphasize the middle or end of words. Marhaba is a smooth, flowing word. Don't shout! Say it smoothly and evenly. Keep the rhythm flat and friendly, not dramatic.

How trade, culture, and Islam shaped Arabic words in India

From Hal to Waqt: The twin words that bind the dialects

Crossover Word (Hindi/Urdu) Arabic Origin Meaning How it Influences the GCC Dialect Waqt (वक़्त) Waqt (وقت) Time When an Indian asks, ""Kitna waqt?"" (How much time?), an Arab often understands the concept instantly, even if the phrasing isn't Modern Standard Arabic. It’s a shared time-teller. Hal (हाल) Hāl (حال) Condition/State Both languages use this word to ask about well-being. The classic Arabic greeting Kayfa Halak? (How are you?) sounds familiar because of the Hindi/Urdu word for 'condition'. Sahi (सही) Sahīh (صحيح) Correct/Right A simple, powerful affirmative. When an Indian says, ""Sahi baat"" (Correct point), the word itself is instantly recognized by an Arab speaker as meaning ""true"" or ""right."" Qalam (क़लम) Qalam (قلم) Pen Whether you're in a Dubai office or a Mumbai school, the object used for writing is often called qalam. This shared administrative vocabulary is a direct historical link. Amir (अमीर) Amīr (أمير) Rich/Wealthy (or Prince) In Arabic, it means ""prince"" or ""commander."" In Hindi/Urdu, it evolved to mean ""rich."" The shared root confirms a concept of power and status familiar to both cultures.







When you live and work in the Gulf, a few Arabic words sneak into your vocabulary even if you don’t speak Arabic fluently. Words like yalla, inshallah, habibi, khalas and mashallah turn up in shops, on construction sites, in offices and family chats. These words are so common that they become part of everyday speech for many Indians living in the GCC.Let's explore some Arabic words that have become an integral part of the daily conversations of Indians in the Gulf:These words not only enrich the language but also reflect the deep cultural integration between Arabs and Indians in the Gulf.If you're an Indian expat, you've probably nailed the everyday Arabic phrases. But sometimes, those deep Arabic sounds don't exist in Hindi, and our desi pronunciation can land us in hilarious, or awkward, trouble.Here are a few quick tips to save you from mixing up your greetings, your heart, and the nearest canine:The linguistic connection between India and the Arab world stretches back over a millennium, shaped by centuries of trade, cultural exchange, and religious interaction. Arab traders frequented India’s coastal regions, especially Kerala, Gujarat, and the Konkan coast, drawn by spices, textiles, and other valuable goods.Over time, these interactions introduced Arabic vocabulary into Indian languages, while the establishment of communities like the Mappilas in Kerala reflected deeper cultural and linguistic blending. The spread of Islam further cemented Arabic’s influence, as it became the liturgical language and contributed words and expressions to Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam, and Gujarati.In the modern era, particularly after the 1970s Gulf oil boom, large-scale migration of Indian workers to countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman strengthened these linguistic ties. Daily life in the Gulf exposed Indians to Arabic phrases, which gradually merged with their native languages. Today, words like “yalla” (let’s go), “habibi” (my dear), and “inshallah” (God willing) are part of everyday conversations, reflecting centuries of cultural interaction and the ongoing evolution of language in a shared, multicultural space.The most mind-boggling part of the Arabic-Indian linguistic crossover isn't the phrases learned in the Gulf, but the common words that Indians have unknowingly carried from the subcontinent. These ""twin words"" sound almost identical in Hindi/Urdu and Arabic, effortlessly bridging the communication gap and showing how deep the roots of their shared vocabulary go.This linguistic comfort zone means Indian expats often don't need a translator for core concepts, as these words have been an integral part of Indian languages for centuries, mainly filtered through Persian.When in doubt, remember that the Arabic language uses the back of the throat far more than Hindi. A little guttural effort can save your heart from becoming a dog! The linguistic and cultural ties between India and the Arab world are profound and multifaceted. From ancient trade routes to modern migration, these connections have enriched both cultures. For Indians in the Gulf, incorporating Arabic words into daily conversations is a testament to this enduring relationship. Embracing the Arabic language can further enhance these connections, fostering greater understanding and appreciation of the shared history and culture.","How trade, culture, and Islam shaped Arabic words in India.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

The Labubu craze isn't what it used to be





When Apple 's Tim Cook walked into a Labubu exhibition in Shanghai on October 13, he probably didn't expect to become the talk of Hong Kong's stock exchange the next morning. But that's exactly what happened after the Cook met with Pop Mart founder Wang Ning and the fuzzy-toothed character's creator, Kasing Lung—and left with a custom doll clutching a miniature iPhone Pop Mart shares jumped as much as 6.1% on Tuesday, making the Chinese toymaker one of the day's top performers on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. Cook posted enthusiastically on Weibo about watching Lung sketch characters on an iPad Pro, while the designer shared his own excitement: ""Great meeting you Tim! Thanks for visiting The Monsters by Monsters 10th Anniversary exhibition in Shanghai. Hope you enjoy the unique 'Tim Cook Labubu' we made for you. ""The market immediately started buzzing about what this could mean. A potential collaboration between Apple's tech empire and Pop Mart's collectible toy kingdom? Investors were ready to believe. The visit seemed to signal Apple's growing interest in Chinese cultural IPs, while Pop Mart got a massive visibility boost from one of tech's biggest names.But the euphoria didn't last. By mid-morning, those impressive gains had cooled to around 2%, with the stock still sitting about 20% below its August peak.Here's the reality: Pop Mart has already had quite the year. Shares tripled in early 2025 as Labubu mania swept across Asia, but the initial frenzy has since mellowed. The company now faces the classic collectibles challenge—keeping the magic alive once everyone who wanted one has already grabbed theirs.Cook's visit came during a broader China tour that included his first-ever livestream sales event on Douyin.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined. The future, he says, will favour those who combine technical understanding with creativity, critical thinking, and leadership qualities that remain uniquely human.","Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti outlines four strategies on how employees can succeed in the AI-driven workplace.

"After OpenAI, AMD signs chip deal with Oracle: What this may mean for its biggest rival Nvidia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-openai-amd-signs-chip-deal-with-oracle-what-this-may-mean-for-its-biggest-rival-nvidia/articleshow/124556607.cms,"What AMD’s newest deal mean for Nvidia







Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has announced that it plans to deploy 50,000 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) graphics processors starting in the second half of 2026. OCI will utilise AMD's Instinct MI450 chips, which were unveiled earlier this year. These chips are AMD’s first AI processors that can be assembled into a larger rack-sized system, enabling 72 of the chips to function as a single unit. This capability is necessary for creating and deploying the most advanced AI algorithms.This move signals that cloud providers are increasingly adopting AMD's GPUs as a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading products for artificial intelligence workloads.“We feel like customers are going to take up AMD very, very well — especially in the inferencing space,” said Karan Batta, senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Inference in AI is defined as the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.Recently, AMD announced a partnership with AMD wherein the AI startup will purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips over multiple years, including the forthcoming MI450 series. Furthermore, as part of the agreement, OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares.This means that if OpenAI exercises the full warrant based on deployment volume and AMD's share price, the Al firm could acquire roughly 10% ownership in AMD.The company is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded”, AMD CEO Lisa Su said at an interview recently.Su added, “I really believe that this is the beginning of a 10-year kind of supercycle.”“We believe with the proper use of Al compute, you can solve diseases faster. You can do much faster drug discovery. You can do much better in terms of diagnosing issues that people have early on and that makes ... a personal difference in people's lives,” she noted.","Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) plans to deploy 50,000 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) graphics processors starting in the second half of 2026.
