Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This phone was previously known as the Galaxy S25 Slim.

Samsung President and CEO, Southwest Asia, JB Park has called out trust issues with Chinese smartphones. Speaking to Economic Times at the launch of Samsung Galaxy S25 series in San Jose, US, the Samsung executive took aim at Chinese smartphone rivals, questioning their trustworthiness when it comes to handling user data for AI applications in India.JB Park, President and CEO of Samsung Southwest Asia, suggested that Indian consumers need to consider which brands they can reliably entrust with their private information.These comments come as Samsung faces competition in India from Chinese smartphone companies. Park reportedly acknowledged the rapid adoption of AI by Chinese brands but emphasized the ""trust factor,"" posing the question of whether these brands are truly trustworthy with sensitive user data.Park admitted that Samsung is unlikely to win every battle in every price segment but reiterated the company's commitment to meeting Indian consumer needs through differentiated products, with AI playing a crucial role. He likened the current stage of AI development to the early days of the internet, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of its future.To further reach consumers, particularly in rural areas, Samsung plans to double its service center network to 800 by the end of 2025. This initiative aims to provide hands-on experience with the latest mobile technologies, including AI, which Park believes is crucial given the limitations of online experiences.Samsung launched the new flagship phones in three variants: Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Samsung Strengthens 'Make in India' Commitment

Galaxy S25 Series Now Available for Pre-Order

Samsung is making a major push into artificial intelligence (AI), integrating the technology across its entire product portfolio, from smartphones and consumer electronics to budget-friendly devices. This move signals a shift from limiting AI to premium products.JB Park, President and CEO of Samsung SouthWest Asia, reiterated the company's commitment to AI during a press event in San Jose before the launch of the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung's latest flagship smartphones.Park outlined Samsung's vision for an AI-powered ecosystem, stating that ""every consumer electronics product will have AI in it going forward."" This suggests a future where AI is not just for high-end devices but becomes a standard feature across all price ranges.Park also addressed the Indian smartphone market, highlighting the increasing popularity of premium phones in smaller cities (tier 2 and tier 3). To cater to this demand, Samsung plans to double the number of Samsung Experience Stores in these areas by the end of 2025. These stores provide a unique blend of online and offline shopping experiences, making advanced technology more accessible to consumers.""Today's consumers crave experiences,"" Park explained. ""With so much readily available online on platforms like YouTube and Instagram, our strategy is to create immersive experiences across cities. We envision stores where consumers can interact with and learn about our technology, something a purely online experience can't replicate. Building physical spaces is crucial, and we're committed to expanding them.""Park reaffirmed Samsung's dedication to the 'Make in India' initiative by announcing that the Galaxy S25 series will be manufactured at the company's Noida plant.For those unfamiliar, Samsung recently unveiled its newest Galaxy S series smartphones at its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose.

The Current Landscape for Jordynne Grace: A Transition Put Into Motion

Reaching Out to Fans via Social Media

Jordynne Grace may be mum on what's next for her in the future, but she is making quite a ruckus on social media‚Äîespecially about Rhea Ripley . On January 22, Ripley posted a workout photo on X (formerly Twitter), which sparked huge attention. As fans complimented her, Grace's cheeky reply managed to steal the show and received thousands of likes and retweets. This playful jab has sparked speculation over Grace's next step, with insiders thinking that Grace might be entering the fray for Royal Rumble.Commissioner Grace's statement would seem to be in keeping. TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) just took her off their official roster, rather quietly suddenly, so where to next for Grace? Most people's interests have been piqued, inviting lots of speculative curiosity about life after TNA. Many fans are now wondering over which land would the journey take her next and if her light-hearted dig at Ripley would hint towards a shift in loyalties.Meanwhile, WWE. The buzz around WWE could hardly be pushed aside. WWE insiders are excited about the potential appearance of Grace at the upcoming Royal Rumble, as some like to guess. A little more of the intrigue in her story is generated by these little things and, in the second part, the subject under discussion: fun posts, indeed. Or intentional moves to put her name out there during the most critical points in time, it is still up to the critics.It was very recently that Jordynne Grace was seen at the WWE Performance Center. It was seen as proof of her talking with the company. So far, according to PWInsider, she is not back this week. However, just this one little piece of information was enough to set rumors running haunts as to what the future might portend for her and WWE. Fans are left to ponder whether Grace is merely training in case she will return or is setting up something for a full-time position with the organization.There is no other aspect of professional wrestling that comes close to how important social media is. Services like X make it possible for wrestlers to have a direct channel to the fan base, helping build stories and hype for their careers. Grace's witty remark on Ripley's post, ‚ÄúHey big head ‚Äì,‚Äù is a prime example of how wrestlers can generate buzz through social media. By commenting on a fellow star's post, she ensures her name stays relevant while maintaining a connection with her fans beyond the ring.Powerhouse WWE wrestler and immense fan favorite Rhea Ripley is always uploading about her workout routines and rigorous training on social media. So, whenever Grace replied on social media in a light-hearted way, the fans immediately saw through the off-camera friendship, answering curiosity about the rapport between wrestlers yet again. Thus, with this portrayal, the private moments remind the audience of the potential for great storylines and matches down the road.At a time when speculation grows about whether Jordynne Grace will participate in the Royal Rumble, her social media activity with Rhea Ripley marks a turning point of sorts in her career, now that TNA has already called it quits on her and WWE is monitoring her closely. Fans are eagerly waiting to see what the future holds for this exciting wrestler. Grace's sharp commentary only goes to show her personality and connection with fans but remains an interesting indicator of what is yet to come in her wrestling career. All eyes are on Jordynne Grace as wrestling enthusiasts await exciting occurrences soon.Also Read : Triple H Drops Major Hint on Bad Bunny‚Äôs WWE Return","Jordynne Grace is making quite a ruckus on social media, especially about Rhea Ripley.
