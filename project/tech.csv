Patrick Mahomes on why Taylor Swift should sit out the big game

The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are warming up for the second Super Bowl in three years with minimal rancor. ""Bad Blood"" from Taylor Swift's 1989 album may make it to the halftime show, and Kendrick Lamar has been announced as the headliner with SZA as a special guest. Lamar, who won five Grammys for his diss track ""Not Like Us,"" is set to perform.Some fans are eagerly awaiting the collaboration between Lamar and Swift, whom they have been close to for more than a decade. However, during Super Bowl opening night, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes dispelled these rumors, saying that Swift will not be performing at Caesars Superdome.The major 2025 TV event will be Super Bowl LIX, with the Philadelphia Eagles against the Kansas City Chiefs. Fans will be able to enjoy a halftime show headlined by Kendrick Lamar, but Taylor Swift, who is a Chiefs fan, will not perform. Patrick Mahomes predicts that the event will be entertaining, especially with Lamar's electric performance and Swift's support for the Chiefs.Taylor Swift is a very entertaining pop star with the voice, stage presence, and song catalog to headline a Super Bowl halftime show. But Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes thinks it would be perfect for her to sit out the game. Mahomes spoke to the media during SB Opening Night at New Orleans' Superdome, sharing his humorous take.“Everyone wants to see a Taylor Swift halftime show, can you help us make that happen?” One reporter asked Mahomes. “As long as Trav’s playing and we’re in the Super Bowl, it’s going to be hard for her to do the halftime show,” Mahomes said. “So hopefully Trav keeps playing and we keep making it to the Super Bowl.”Swift has become a regular at games, cheering on her boyfriend Travis Kelce from a luxurious suite while wearing a Chiefs jacket. Ideally, she wants to stay a spectator to focus on her energy, as Kelce would miss the performance due to his teammates in the locker room during halftime.Patrick Mahomes can be funny about what Taylor Swift is doing at the Super Bowl, but fans have to know that Kendrick Lamar does appear on a track for a remixed version of Swift's 2015 single ""Bad Blood."" The idea of a potential team-up at the Super Bowl is intriguing, but the chances of it happening are probably slim.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift's dad ditch Travis Kelce and support the Eagles during the Super Bowl LIX?

The Blue Jays plans to attract Pete Alonso by beating the Mets' $70 Million offer

""Pete Alonso's market -- and some of the reporting around it -- has been ... unique. Yes, the Blue Jays like Alonso, but this continues to feel like a situation where Alonso is waiting for the Mets. Like they've done many times in past pursuits, the Blue Jays can position themselves well as the next-best option here.""

""It may be enough in the end, but my eyes are still on the Mets. Adding Alonso to this lineup on a three- or four-year deal would be quite an upgrade for the Blue Jays. If any team has the money to steal the slugger from the Mets, it's the Blue Jays,""

Amidst Pete Alonso 's contract discussions with the New York Mets , the Toronto Blue Jays have come out to be a potential team interested in signing the first baseman. In fact, according to a recent report, the Blue Jays are most likely to beat the Mets' previous offer to Alonso, with a $116 Million contract, in hopes of signing him for the upcoming season.The New York Mets have offered Pete Alonso a contract worth $70 Million for 3-years, which, according to multiple reports, the first baseman has already rejected. However, with just a few weeks left until Spring Training, the Toronto Blue Jays are highly likely to offer a contract that would lure Alonso into signing with them.According to Newsweek, Pete Alonso's current market value is somewhere around $174 Million for a 6-year deal. That's an average of around $29 Million a year. However, the Mets' previous offer was making this number $23.3 Million, which is pretty low. Therefore, according to the publication, the team might offer a 4-year deal worth $116 to beat the Mets' offer.The Blue Jays' contract is worth evaluating for Pete Alonso because it doesn't just offer him his annual market value but also won't be making him commit for a long 6 years. Therefore, Alonso's agent Scott Boras might want to leverage out a little more to get the first baseman signed for a better deal with the Blue Jays.Talking about Pete Alonso's future with the Toronto Blue Jays, the ex-Mets general manager recently expressed finding the two ""a great fit."" Nevertheless, MLB insider Keegan Matheson also talked about Alonso's future with the Blue Jays recently and said:Matheson concluded.The New York Yankees previously made an attractive offer to Pete Alonso. However, according to a recent report, it was Alonso's agent Scott Boras, who failed to retain the Yankee's interest in signing the first baseman.

The Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles made their way into New Orleans to play Super Bowl LIX , with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce sporting a vintage look with a special tribute - that is a white and purple Super Bowl XXXI cap.

Swift sings, “I want to wear his initial / On a chain ’round my neck, chain ’round my neck / Not because he owns me / But ’cause he really knows me.”Swift initially referenced her then-boyfriend Joe Alwyn in her song, but she later changed it to reflect her current relationship with Kelce during her Eras Tour, showcasing her ability to adapt her music to her current life. The lyric of “Karma” from Midnights originally went: “Karma is the guy on the screen / Coming straight home to me.” But she started singing it as: “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs / Coming straight home to me.”Also Read: ""He's written 'mine' on my upper thigh"": Why is there a talk about Taylor Swift's ‘T’ charm?

Fans Call Snoop Dogg & Tom Brady’s Super Bowl Ad Cringeworthy and Out of Touch

“I hate this commercial.”

“Sadly, I can’t believe a word Snoop is saying.”

Tom Brady & Snoop Dogg: The Wrong Messengers for the Message?

Super Bowl Ads Have Power—But This One Missed

What do you think? Did this ad deliver its message, or was it the wrong pairing for the cause?

The Super Bowl LIX commercial featuring Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg was supposed to be a bold stand against hate. Instead, it became a lightning rod for criticism. The hype was real, but the execution? Not so much. The much-anticipated ""No Reason to Hate"" Super Bowl LIX ad, backed by the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism (FCAS), aimed to spark conversation about unity featuring Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg was meant to be a powerful message against hate. Instead, it left many viewers cringing, questioning whether the casting was the right fit for such a serious cause.The ad featured Snoop and Brady roasting each other in a lighthearted way before shifting into a serious plea to stand against hate. But for many viewers, the transition felt forced. Instead of being moved, they were rolling their eyes. One unimpressed viewer called itAnother bluntly stated,Others questioned the credibility of the message, with one user writing,For an ad meant to inspire, it seems to have annoyed more people than it moved.One of the biggest criticisms was whether Brady and Snoop were the right voices for such a serious cause. While both are icons in their respective fields, neither has been particularly vocal about activism or combating hate. Some fans pointed out that superstars worth hundreds of millions of dollars telling people to ""do better"" felt disingenuous. Others referenced the NFL’s history of performative gestures.Rather than feeling inspired, many viewers felt like the ad missed the emotional depth needed to resonate.With Super Bowl commercials carrying massive cultural weight, brands and organizations use them to deliver impactful messages. But if the audience doesn’t connect, even a well-funded, well-intentioned ad can fall flat.While the ""No Reason to Hate"" campaign aimed to unite, it appears to have left many viewers rolling their eyes instead of nodding their heads. Whether it sparks actual conversation—or just fades into the sea of Super Bowl misfires—remains to be seen.Also read - Snoop Dogg's Hilarious Roast of Tom Brady in Super Bowl Ad Comes with an Unexpected Lesson","The Super Bowl LIX commercial featuring Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg was supposed to be a bold stand against hate.

Dubai has been long celebrated as a global retail haven, and is now making waves in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Known for its expansive malls and top-tier brands, the city is seamlessly blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.Behind the luxurious displays and bespoke offerings lies a layer of AI-powered innovation that’s redefining personalisation, streamlining operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction. From designing jewellery to curating personalised shopping experiences, Dubai is setting new benchmarks in the global retail landscape.In today’s retail environment, customers seek experiences that resonate on a personal level. AI has emerged as the linchpin of this transformation. Amreen Iqbal , Founder and Creative Director of Piece of You, a custom jewellery brand in Dubai, emphasises the depth of this shift: “It’s about understanding the customer deeper—what they want, how they want it, and how we can make it special and unique to each customer. AI helps us do that.”Her brand employs AI-powered tools to enable customers to design unique jewellery pieces through virtual try-ons and bespoke customisation. “The ability to personalise jewellery at this level was unthinkable a few years ago. Now, with AI, it’s a reality,” she adds.Similarly, global e-commerce innovations have gained traction in Dubai. Sue Azari , an e-commerce consultant at, notes, “AI enables highly customised and intuitive customer experiences.”She cites Zalando’s AI-powered chatbot as a perfect example: “If you need an outfit for a Christmas party, you simply describe your needs, and the chatbot curates a complete look, including accessories. It’s like having a personal shopper who knows your wardrobe.”In the beauty sector, major players like Sephora are redefining the customer journey with AI. Through augmented reality (AR) and AI features, their app enables users to virtually try on products like lipstick shades while integrating seamless social sharing options. Azari explains, “It’s about creating an experience, not just a transaction.”Walid BenOthman, Managing Director at Bitpanda, in Dubai, added that AI-driven personalisation has created a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction, revenue, or cost reduction. “Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 customer support, improving engagement and customer satisfaction.”He explained AI has made it easy to bring in hyper-personalised advertisements by analysing customer behaviour, creating more effective campaigns and higher conversion rates.Adding to Dubai’s retail innovation is the launch of theat Dubai Mall, as reported. The AI-powered store enhances the telecom retail experience by offering an array of cutting-edge features. Using AI and robotics, customers can explore products, make payments, and even collect purchases from automated lockers.The store is equipped with advanced facial recognition technology, enabling personalised interactions and tailored product suggestions. It epitomises Dubai’s vision to merge physical retail with AI-driven efficiency. As highlighted in several news reports, this initiative underscores Dubai’s commitment to revolutionising traditional retail through technology. report by GoGlobe has highlighted that Dubai AI’s impact extends beyond personalisation, revolutionising how brands market their products. Generative AI (genAI) has emerged as a game-changer, enabling dynamic, hyper-personalised advertisements and streamlining content creation.“AI doesn’t just generate content; it analyses performance metrics to refine strategies in real-time. It saves marketers countless hours and ensures campaigns are efficient and impactful,” explains Azari.Iqbal highlights AI’s ability to enhance marketing precision through predictive analytics, helping businesses target audiences with unparalleled accuracy. From creating dynamic ads to optimising email campaigns, AI ensures that every touchpoint is relevant and impactful.At Amazon, for instance, AI-generated product descriptions have not only increased efficiency but also improved SEO performance and consistency. “This is not just automation; it’s about making marketing smarter and more strategic,” notes Azari.While customers benefit from AI-driven personalisation, its operational applications are equally transformative. Gavin Jackson, Senior Vice President of Data and AI at Endava, highlights the role of AI in inventory management: “AI has turned inventory management into a science. Retailers can now accurately predict demand, ensuring shelves are stocked without over-ordering. It’s a win for both businesses and consumers.”Jackson explains that AI-powered systems can even trigger additional production when products start selling out, ensuring businesses never miss a sales opportunity. Logistics and supply chains are also undergoing an AI-driven revolution, with systems optimising delivery routes, warehouse layouts, and energy consumption. “It’s about creating an interconnected ecosystem where every touchpoint is as efficient as possible,” he adds.Dubai’s embrace of AI is propelling the city into a new era of retail excellence. By integrating advanced technologies across personalisation, marketing, and operations, the city is not only enhancing customer experiences but also setting a global standard for innovation in retail.As Iqbal aptly puts it, “The ability to create personalised, meaningful experiences isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. And AI makes it possible.”Dubai’s commitment to leveraging AI ensures that its reputation as a global retail hub remains stronger than ever, firmly rooted in innovation and customer-centricity.","Dubai is blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears.The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

""The cake was covered with a thick layer of meat floss, so I was just chewing it until I bit into something hard. I immediately spat it out,"" she explained.Initially assuming it was a bad quality, Liu prepared to complain to the bakery. However, her boyfriend, noticing her confusion, examined the foreign object. After wiping it clean, he revealed, ""Honey, I think this might be the ring I was going to propose to you with.""Caught off guard, Liu thought he was joking but soon realised it was indeed a gold ring.

From decoding 2000-year-old papyrus scroll to DOGE: Meet Elon Musk's wunderkind Luke Farritor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-decoding-2000-year-old-papyrus-scroll-to-doge-meet-elon-musks-wunderkind-luke-farritor/articleshow/117915224.cms,"Luke Farritor: Husker wins grand prize for global Vesuvius Challenge

Luke Farritor isn’t your run-of-the-mill tech wunderkind; he’s the audacious young maestro orchestrating a symphony of silicon, code, and sheer brilliance. In 2024, he catapulted into the limelight by doing something that had stumped historians for centuries—deciphering a 2,000-year-old charred papyrus scroll from Herculaneum using artificial intelligence . Picture this: an ancient relic, blackened by the wrath of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, left unreadable for millennia, until Farritor, armed with algorithms sharper than Occam’s razor, cracked its cryptic whispers. His reward? A cool $700,000 and a ticket to tech stardom.But Luke Farritor wasn’t just plucked from obscurity like a tech-savvy Cinderella. Before his Indiana Jones-meets-AI escapade, he had already been making waves at SpaceX Elon Musk ’s playground for the ambitious and the brilliant. There, amidst rocket fuel and relentless ambition, he interned, absorbing the ethos of innovation like a sponge in zero gravity. Ditching the conventional path, he waved goodbye to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and embraced the Thiel Fellowship—an elite club for those too restless and brilliant to be confined by traditional academia.Now, Farritor is a key player in Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE—yes, named with the kind of meme-savvy irreverence only Musk could muster. DOGE isn’t your typical bureaucratic outfit; it’s a cadre of young, hyper-intelligent disruptors tasked with dragging creaky government systems kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Think less DMV lines, more cutting-edge code.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Study says ChatGPT bias is real — and it’s tilting left; Elon Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/study-says-chatgpt-bias-is-real-and-its-tilting-left-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/117922596.cms,"STUDY: CHATGPT BIAS IS REAL—AND IT’S TILTING LEFT

A new study confirms what many suspected—ChatGPT favors left-leaning views, often avoiding or restricting conservative perspectives.

Researchers found AI-generated text and images systematically leaned left, with right-leaning prompts frequently blocked over so-called “misinformation concerns.”

This raises major questions about fairness, free speech, and AI’s influence on public debate.

With AI shaping news, policy, and education, experts warn: without transparency and safeguards, biased algorithms could reshape democracy itself.

The chatbot developed by Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence (AI) startup xAI, Grok, will soon be available for Android users as a standalone app. The app, which is not yet available for download, has been listed on the Google Play Store , where users can pre-register for it. This follows a brief beta testing period in which some users had access to the app. However, xAI has yet to announce an official release date for the Android app.xAI seems to be preparing to launch an Android version of its AI chatbot a month after releasing Grok 's app for iPhones. An xAI engineer has also confirmed the Android app in a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter).In the post, the xAI engineer wrote:Grok's Play Store listing notes that the app will be free to use, with no sign-in required to access its features. However, users who may want a personalised experience or wish to connect the AI to their X account may also have the option to sign in.It's important to note that Grok’s iPhone app allows users to sign in via their Apple accounts. Similarly, the company may also allow Android users to sign up for the app via their Google accounts. To compare, the web version of the chatbot requires users to be signed in for access.Just like the iPhone app, Grok’s standalone Android app is also expected to include features such as text responses, image generation, and real-time information sourced from X. However, it remains unclear whether the Android app will support web search-based queries.The app is also expected to be powered by the Grok 2 AI model.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Netflix has reportedly removed transgender actress Karla Sofia Gascon from promotional materials for its Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez. This comes a month ahead of the 97th Academy Awards. Several users on social media platforms like X/Twitter and Reddit noted that the streamer appeared to be downplaying Gascon's presence in their Oscar campaign for the film.“Karla Sofia Gascon has been completely erased from the latest Oscars ' For Your Consideration ' ad for Emilia Perez. I wonder why!??,” wrote a user on X, sharing an image of promotional material of the film on Netflix.“New Netflix FYC poster for Emilia Perez without Karla on it oh it’s OVER lmaooo,” wrote another user on X.Gascon, 52, made history as the first openly transgender actress to receive a Best Actress nomination for her portrayal of the film’s titular character. However, promotional materials for the 'For Your Consideration' (FYC) campaign appeared to center on Best Supporting Actress nominee Zoe Saldana, 46. Saldana, who earned her first career Oscar nomination for playing Rita in the Spanish-language film, is widely considered the frontrunner for the award.In a related news, Gascon has faced intense backlash over offensive tweets she posted in the past five years, with remarks about George Floyd, Islam, and diversity at the Oscars sparking widespread criticism. The controversy has quickly overshadowed her awards campaign, drawing significant public and industry scrutiny.In an emotional hour-long interview with CNN en Espanol, Gascon insisted she is not “a racist” as she tearfully addressed her past social media posts. Speaking with interviewer Juan Carlos Arciniegas, she was asked whether she would renounce her historic Oscar nomination—the first ever for an openly transgender actor. Gascon firmly refused, stating, “I cannot renounce a nomination because what I have done is a job, and what is being valued is my acting work,” as translated by The Hollywood Reporter.She further defended her position, saying, “I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone. I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am.”","Gascon, 52, made history as the first openly transgender actress to receive a Best Actress nomination for her portrayal of the film’s titular character.

Steve Jobs had “many skills that I didn’t”: Bill Gates

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently shared candid thoughts about his relationship with Steve Jobs Apple , and pivotal moments in tech history during an interview with Axios. The conversation coincides with the release of Gates' new memoir, Source Code, which chronicles the early days of the computer industry.Reflecting on Steve Jobs, Gates called the late Apple co-founder a ""singular figure"" who had an extraordinary ability to captivate people.""He should have been an actor,"" Gates said. ""He really ran the reality distortion field like no one else.""Despite Jobs' persuasive charisma, Gates claims he was never under his spell. ""I always said to Steve, 'Look, I'm a minor wizard. You're a major wizard. You can cast spells I can't cast, but because I'm a minor wizard, your spells don't work on me. I see the bullshit, that you're just mesmerizing these people.'""Gates recalled a particularly blunt exchange after Jobs unveiled the NeXT computer , a machine that struggled commercially. ""This thing is a slow, expensive computer with an overpriced black case,"" Gates told Jobs at the time.While Gates admired Jobs' ""messianic"" skills in marketing and leadership, he also noted the late Apple co-founder’s lack of technical expertise. ""Steve's achievements are all the more impressive when you know that he couldn't look at a piece of code and know what it was,"" Gates said. ""He was never an engineer. Woz [Steve Wozniak] was a real engineer — I mean, a hardcore engineer.""Despite their differing skill sets and approaches, Gates acknowledged that he and Jobs shared one key talent: the ability to inspire their teams. ""Clearly, he had so many skills that I didn't, but we were both a little bit pied pipers in terms of getting people to work ridiculous hours,"" Gates said.The conversation also touched on Microsoft's pivotal role in saving Apple from bankruptcy in 1997, when it invested in the struggling company and pledged support. Gates said he has no regrets about the move. ""It was good that Apple recovered and made incredible contributions,"" he said. ""Once you get to the mobile thing, then Apple becomes every bit as important as Microsoft. It wasn't up until then. They were more of a niche.""However, Gates admitted that selling Microsoft’s 5% stake in Apple, acquired as part of the deal, was a mistake. ""I wish we'd maintained that 5% ownership,"" he said with a laugh. ""It was foolish, foolish to sell it, but when we're worrying about all sorts of antitrust things, we sold it for what now looks like nothing. And we owned part of Facebook for a while, too.""","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently shared candid thoughts about his relationship with Steve Jobs.
