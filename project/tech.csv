Mark Zuckerberg reveals how Apple’s policies destroyed Facebook’s FarmVille,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-reveals-how-apples-policies-destroyed-facebooks-farmville/articleshow/120879716.cms,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg

How FarmVille and viral apps powered Facebook's early success

Zuckerberg explains how Apple’s App Store restrictions impacted Facebook’s mobile growth

""The original Facebook platform was really built for the web, before mobile became big.""

Apple’s App Store policies and their impact on Facebook

""When people started using mobile more, Apple told us, ‘You can’t have apps inside your app.’ That hurt something that had grown to be an important part of our business.""

Apple’s privacy and tracking policies

The bitter relationship between Meta and Apple

Apple’s legal challenges and the future of mobile platforms

The digital landscape has been shaped by a series of key players over the years, with Facebook, now Meta, standing at the forefront of the social media revolution. But for all its growth and transformation, the platform has faced significant challenges along the way. One of the more notable struggles came when Facebook 's thriving app and game ecosystem, including the wildly popular FarmVille , saw a dramatic decline.In a recent interview with tech writer Ben Thompson from Stratechery, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a critical factor in this decline: Apple ’s strict App Store policies. Zuckerberg explained how Apple’s decisions over the years impacted Facebook’s ability to maintain its business model, particularly its app-based games, and how this shift altered the company’s trajectory in the mobile era.In the late 2000s, Facebook was at the peak of its desktop-based platform, where games and apps played a significant role in the platform's growth. The social network quickly became a hub for developers looking to create interactive content that would engage its growing user base. Games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars, and Texas HoldEm Poker captured the attention of millions, providing Facebook with a fresh revenue stream. By 2012, these apps contributed to about 20% of the company’s revenue, marking a high point for Facebook’s game platform.This success was primarily driven by Facebook’s ability to integrate its game platform into the broader Facebook experience, allowing users to discover and share apps with their friends. The platform was tailored for the web, and developers used Facebook’s social features to create viral games. As the desktop experience dominated, it seemed that Facebook’s app ecosystem would only continue to thrive.However, the rise of smartphones and mobile apps introduced a massive shift in the way people engaged with the internet. The advent of the iPhone and other smartphones ushered in a new era of app-based experiences that would change the way users interacted with social media and online games. As mobile platforms began to dominate, Zuckerberg and his team recognized that Facebook’s future would depend on successfully adapting to the mobile revolution.Unfortunately, Facebook’s smooth transition from desktop to mobile wasn't as seamless as they hoped. Zuckerberg recalled,The company’s model, which relied heavily on web-based interactions, needed to be overhauled to thrive in an app-centric mobile environment.It was at this point that Zuckerberg pointed to Apple’s App Store policies as a significant hurdle for Facebook's continued success in the mobile space. Facebook had initially planned to leverage its own app platform inside the iPhone to continue growing its mobile app and game ecosystem. However, Apple’s stringent rules soon made this impossible.In the early days of mobile app development, Apple implemented rules that severely restricted how companies like Facebook could operate within the App Store. One of the key policies that Zuckerberg highlighted was Apple’s decision to block Facebook from running its own app platform inside the iPhone. Zuckerberg explained,This policy change effectively cut Facebook off from the ability to operate a platform that could support games and apps in the same way it had on desktop. As a result, Facebook's ability to host third-party applications, which had been a core part of its business model, was significantly diminished. While Apple argued that these policies were necessary for maintaining the security and quality of apps on its platform, the restriction ultimately stifled the growth of Facebook’s app-based ecosystem.The ramifications were immediate and profound: Facebook’s once-booming app and game business started to decline, and developers who had once relied on Facebook’s platform for distribution were forced to adapt to the new constraints. Zuckerberg noted that by limiting Facebook’s access to key tools and changing the company’s relationship with developers, Apple set off a chain of events that led to the decline of its game and app platform.In addition to the restrictions on Facebook’s app platform, Zuckerberg also pointed to Apple’s privacy policies as a factor that further undermined Facebook’s mobile business. Specifically, Apple’s introduction of App Tracking Transparency (ATT) in 2020 made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track user behavior across different apps and websites. This update, which required apps to ask users for permission before collecting data for targeted advertising, was seen as a direct challenge to Facebook’s ad-driven revenue model.For Facebook, which had built its business around precise ad targeting, this policy change was a blow to its ability to effectively monetize its platform. Zuckerberg expressed frustration with Apple’s stance, noting that its policies had placed significant limitations on how Facebook could operate in the mobile space.Zuckerberg’s comments on Apple reveal a deeper sense of frustration and bitterness between the two tech giants. He described Apple’s decisions as creating ""deep bitterness"" and emphasized the company’s refusal to consider the value Facebook’s platform could bring to the iPhone ecosystem. Zuckerberg argued that Apple’s approach was too restrictive and that it limited the potential for collaboration between the two companies.He expressed his belief that mobile platforms should be more open, similar to traditional desktop systems such as Windows or macOS, where developers have more freedom to build their own ecosystems and offer a wider range of services. Zuckerberg lamented that Apple’s ""walled garden"" approach prevented Facebook from fully realizing its potential in the mobile era.Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when Apple is facing increasing legal scrutiny over its App Store policies. Recently, a U.S. judge ruled that Apple had violated an earlier order by continuing to block developers from linking users to external payment options. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle in which Apple is being accused of maintaining an illegal monopoly over the app market. Apple is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, which claims that the company’s practices harm competition in the smartphone industry.For Zuckerberg and Meta, these developments offer a glimmer of hope that Apple’s ""walled garden"" may eventually start to open up, allowing for greater freedom for developers and a more open mobile platform. As regulators push back against Apple’s control over the App Store, Zuckerberg and other tech leaders may see this as an opportunity for a more balanced and competitive mobile ecosystem.","Zuckerberg explains how Apple's App Store restrictions impacted Facebook’s mobile growth. In the late 2000s, Facebook was at the peak of its desktop-based platform, where games and apps played a significant role in the platform's growth. The rise of smartphones and mobile apps introduced a massive shift in the way people engaged with the internet.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120879895,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Facebook-founder-Mark-Zuckerberg.jpg"

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoves man trying to approach her in Miami,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ivanka-trumps-bodyguard-shoves-man-trying-to-approach-her-in-miami-watch-video/articleshow/120915647.cms,"



Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoved a man after he repeatedly tried to approach her and her husband, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday night. A video of the incident, now viral on TikTok, shows the tense moment as the bodyguard intervenes when the man, who was carrying a Manila folder, attempts to sidle up to the couple outside the Carbone Beach venue.The clip, which has garnered significant attention online, begins with the Kushners walking toward a waiting car when the unidentified man approaches them. Dressed in tan shorts and a black T-shirt, he makes a move towards the pair, prompting Ivanka’s bodyguard, dressed in black trousers and a purple shirt, to step in and block him. The bodyguard initially pushes the man away gently, but when the man swats the guard’s hand aside and tries to advance once more, the security personnel responds by forcefully shoving him in the chest. The impact sends the man flying backward off camera.Ivanka and Jared briefly turn around to assess the situation before quickly being ushered into their SUV.The incident, which occurred at a high-profile event attended by just 400 guests, was met with mixed reactions. One Twitter user wrote, “Holy smokes. Ivanka Trump’s security guard does not mess around,” while another quipped, “Do NOT mess with the Trump family!” Others on social media debated the appropriateness of the response, with one suggesting, “Bet she fires him anyway.That was excessive and not a good look. ” Another commenter defended the guard, saying, “The white guy was being a jerk... The guard HAD to respond in a microsecond because he literally didn’t have time to check if a handgun was coming out or not.”The glitzy event, which saw tickets priced at $3,000, included a performance by Jelly Roll, NYPost reported.","Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoved a man after he repeatedly tried to approach her and her husband, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday night.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Formula E: Driver – plot overview

What the drivers and makers said about the show

As racing enthusiasts look for something to binge on between races, a new show titled Formula E: Driver has premiered on Amazon Prime—perfect for those looking to explore the lives of some of the biggest Formula E drivers off the track. The four-part series follows the journeys of TAG Heuer Porsche ’s António Félix da Costa, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans , Andretti’s Jake Dennis , and Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum as they navigate the highs and lows of Season 10 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Formula E: Driver offers unfiltered access to the lives of four electric car racers, combining exclusive on- and off-track footage to give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the drama and intensity of Season 10.Produced by Astronaut Films, Driver opens in Mexico, as reigning champion Jake Dennis returns from a summer of celebrations, hungry to retain his title. The series goes behind the visor to follow Dan Ticktum, whose ‘bad boy’ reputation has his future at Formula E hanging in the balance, before culminating in London’s dramatic season finale, where five drivers, including Mitch Evans and António Félix da Costa, fiercely compete for the championship crown.António Félix da Costa, who drives under No. 13, said about the show, “This documentary takes you completely behind the scenes, giving fans a raw and unfiltered look at what it means to be a racing driver. We’ve captured the highs, the heartbreaks, and everything in between—bringing viewers inside our world to experience the intensity, pressure, and passion that fuel our sport. Success and failure define motorsport, and with this series, we’re pulling back the curtain to show it all.""Mitch Evans noted: “The launch of Formula E: Driver is really exciting and hopefully the series will bring a new, unique insight into the world of Formula E. It was great to work with Astronaut Films and the Formula E team on this new venture, which we hope will allow fans to see just what it takes to compete in the world's most competitive motorsport, and enable our sport to grow and reach a much wider audience.""Jake Dennis added, “Having the production team follow me throughout the entire season gave a true insight into what it’s really like to be a Formula E driver—the highs, the lows, and everything in between. Fans usually only see what happens on race day, but this series captures so much more. It’s great to have documentaries like this that bring fans closer to the sport and show the reality of what it takes to compete at this level.”Dan Ticktum also said, “Filming Formula E: Driver was pretty intense, but I really enjoyed it. I like the fact that Formula E and all of the guys at Astronaut were very keen on having drivers express who they are. A lot of the filming was very fun, and I was able to be myself a lot of the time. Hopefully, the series will give a good insight into what it’s like being a Formula E driver , and I hope that it’s successful so we can continue to film for years to come.”Aarti Dabas, Chief Media Officer, Formula E, said the series “reveals the human stories behind the helmets of our hugely talented drivers that reach far beyond the sporting action on the track” She expressed her excitement as they bring the no-holds-barred, all-access perspective to a global audience on Prime Video.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix: Formula E drivers Mitch Evans, Antonio Felix Da Costa and Nick Cassidy soak in Monaco vibes ahead of the big race Jon Alwen, Formula E: Driver Exec Producer and Astronaut Films CEO, described making Formula E: Driver as a “real privilege”.

Monaco E-Prix Round 6 highlights





Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

Spike Lee hits the carpet in bold Met Gala New York Knicks tribute



While the New York Knicks were battling the Boston Celtics in a nail-biting Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, their most passionate fan was turning heads on a very different stage. Spike Lee , the iconic filmmaker and longtime Knicks loyalist, wasn't courtside at TD Garden on Monday night. Instead, he was making waves at the 2025 Met Gala in New York City.Legendary filmmaker Spike Lee decked out in a customized ensemble that paid homage to his beloved Knicks. Lee embodied the Met Gala’s theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which celebrated the heritage and influence of Black menswear fashion. Despite missing the playoff game, Lee made sure the Knicks were represented among the A-listers on the red carpet.Meanwhile, back on the hardwood, the Knicks silenced the Boston crowd with a thrilling 108-105 victory. OG Anunoby and Jalen Brunson led the charge, each dropping 29 points and playing with poise under pressure. Anunoby, in particular, was electric, knocking down 6 of 11 from beyond the arc and shooting an even 50% from the field. Brunson, who was relentless on offense, went 5-for-9 from deep and converted 6 of 7 free throws.Josh Hart was the unsung hero of the night. In 45 gritty minutes, he racked up 14 points and 11 rebounds, doing the dirty work that doesn’t always show up in highlight reels. Mikal Bridges had a tough shooting night (3-for-13), but contributed significantly elsewhere, grabbing 6 rebounds, dishing 7 assists, and swiping 3 steals. Off the bench, Miles McBride chipped in 11 points in just under 19 minutes, including three crucial three-pointers that kept New York’s momentum alive.Karl-Anthony Towns, the Knicks’ midseason addition, added 14 points and 13 rebounds, though foul trouble hampered his minutes. Mitchell Robinson’s night was less memorable, he went 0-for-0 from the field and struggled at the free-throw line (3-for-10), though he did pull down 7 rebounds. LeBron James , the 2025 Met Gala’s honorary chair, was absent due to an MCL injury.Oscar-winning duo Denzel Washington and Spike Lee are teaming up once again, this time for Highest 2 Lowest, a gripping crime thriller backed by A24 and Apple. Their latest collaboration marks a long-awaited reunion after nearly two decades, following a string of critically acclaimed films like Malcolm X, He Got Game, and Inside Man.The first trailer for Highest 2 Lowest just dropped, giving fans a preview of the film that’s set to premiere later this month at the Cannes Film Festival.

Following months of silence, Rockstar Games eventually announced that Grand Theft Auto VI is no longer coming out in 2025. Rather, the highly anticipated game has been rescheduled for May 26, 2026. But in a bizarre turn of events, all of Rockstar's key platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, and the official GTA 6 website, continue to display the original artwork boldly stating:Rockstar's communication about the delay has been surprisingly incoherent. The announcement, published on a random Friday, confirmed the game's slip to 2026 but provided no new trailer, no new screenshots, and, strangely, no new promotional material. The samekey art that was used to reveal the game in December 2023 is still intact on Rockstar's digital platforms.This is highly uncharacteristic for the company. In the past, Rockstar has softened blowback from delays with slick new visuals or trailers. The absence of any such update here has left fans speculating: was this announcement rushed? Did Rockstar simply not have time to prepare new assets? Or is something bigger coming soon?To further compound the confusion, the delay announcement was released shortly after a UK bank holiday. With GTA 6 officially confirmed for May 26, 2026, the timing of the release had fans confused as to why Rockstar hadn't revised its marketing materials. Rockstar's marketing efforts are based in the UK, so their teams wouldn't be in until Tuesday, following the long weekend. Even taking this into account, it still seems strange that they did not have any updates lined up for such a significant release. Nevertheless, fans anticipated such a multinational company to be prepared with new materials, particularly for a flagship title like GTA 6.There could be a strategic motive behind Rockstar's silence. The parent company of the firm, Take-Two Interactive, will report quarterly earnings on May 15. Perhaps Rockstar made the announcement of the delay ahead of time, so the share price can stabilize before releasing new footage or screenshots that might create renewed hype and temper investor concerns.Others think that fresh artwork, this time with the caption ""Coming May 26, 2026"", will fall with a second trailer or gameplay announcement. If so, this might be the reason that no visual tweaks have been observed yet. This would also align with Rockstar's typical strategy of timing significant beats around monetary milestones.Though the delay in itself wasn't surprising, the lack of new artwork has surprised most fans. Whether it was a mistake or an intentional marketing tactic is uncertain. One thing, however, is certain, if Rockstar is hiding a big reveal, it had better drop it soon.Also Read: Fans spot Bonnie and Clyde connection in GTA 6’s May 26 release","Rockstar Games announced that Grand Theft Auto VI is no longer coming out in 2025.
