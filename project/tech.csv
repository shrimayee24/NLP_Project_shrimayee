Kayla Nicole’s journey from being judged to being empowered

Welcome to The Pre-Game

Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce , shedding light on how not just he but other past partners treated her harshly. In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success. In a recent episode, she recalled a college relationship with a then-NBA hopeful a man she supported, only to have him dim her own ambitions in return. It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, Nicole said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. She stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.","Kayla Nicole opened up on her new podcast The Pre-Game.

Internet swoons as Brittany Mahomes posts sweet moment of Bronze saying his real name at age two



Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are giving fans another heartwarming glimpse into their growing family, this time with a rare and adorable appearance by their 2-year-old son, Bronze. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his wife, Brittany, are never shy about sharing special moments with their children, but this recent video truly struck a chord with fans.On April 8, Brittany Mahomes took to Instagram Stories to post a touching clip of her and Bronze enjoying some outdoor time. In the video, Brittany gently asks her toddler, “What’s your name?” With a shy grin, he replies, “Bronzie.” When prompted about his real name, the little boy proudly responds, “Patrick Mahomes Three,” holding up three tiny fingers. A glowing Brittany smiles and responds with, “Nice job.”Though the couple often refers to their son by his nickname, Bronze, his full name—Patrick Lavon Mahomes III—is a meaningful tribute to his father. Patrick Mahomes has long envisioned passing down his name, once sharing, “I've thought about that since I was really like five, six years old.” The nickname “Bronze” not only creates a unique identity for their son but also keeps with a fun family tradition. Their two dogs are named Steel and Silver, and their daughters, Sterling Skye and Golden Raye, also have metallic-inspired names.The sweet exchange between Brittany and Bronze wasn’t just confined to her Instagram. Patrick also reshared the video, accompanied by three “A-OK” emojis, proudly acknowledging the moment. It’s clear that this family cherishes every milestone, no matter how small.During a January appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Brittany joked about using Bronze’s formal name, saying, “I have to say his real name or his dad will get mad,” further confirming just how personal the name is for Patrick. It’s evident the couple puts thought and meaning into every aspect of their children’s lives.The Mahomes family has had an eventful start to 2025, recently welcoming their third child, Golden Raye, just weeks before Patrick competed in his fifth Super Bowl. Despite the Chiefs’ tough loss to the Eagles, Patrick’s message to fans was one of humility and determination. “I let ya’ll down today… I’ll always continue to work and try and learn and be better for it.”Through all the highs and lows—on and off the field—Brittany and Patrick Mahomes remain grounded in family. Their latest video with Bronze not only showcases a touching parenting moment but also reminds fans of the values that truly matter to them: love, legacy, and connection.Also Read: Rookie QB Caleb Williams already feeling the pressure from Ben Johnson’s coaching style","Brittany and Patrick Mahomes' 2-year-old son, Bronze, says his real name.

Deion Sanders' daughter Deiondra blasts fiancé Jacquees’ family for allegedly ignoring their son Snow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/deion-sanders-daughter-deiondra-blasts-fianc-jacquees-family-for-allegedly-ignoring-their-son-snow/articleshow/120170387.cms,"Credit: Instagram

Deiondra Sanders and Jacquees feud deepens as family rift becomes public



What once seemed like a standard breakup in the celebrity world has now unraveled into something far more layered and emotional. The rift between Deiondra Sanders and R&B singer Jacquees is no longer confined to vague posts or whispers—it’s becoming a full-blown family saga with their eight-month-old son, Baby Snow, caught in the middle.The drama began to intensify following the release of F— a Friend Zone 2, Jacquees’ collaborative album with DeJ Loaf. The project made waves not just for its suggestive title, but for what was missing: Deiondra. Once a visible presence beside Jacquees, her sudden absence was noticed by fans—and she didn’t keep them guessing for long. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), she cleared the air in one cryptic line: ""Stop asking me why I'm not around. I'm not allowed to be around them.""The weight of that statement was undeniable. What began as speculation over music soon revealed a much deeper tension rooted in family dynamics. Just a day after her tweet, Jacquees appeared to counter the growing narrative with a heartwarming Instagram post. Sharing a carousel of pictures and videos with Baby Snow, he gushed in the caption: ""My son is 8 months today! Thank you Jesus and he is the funniest baby on earth I promise you all he do is laugh and play! He’s so smart! Love you Son! 8 months down a lifetime to go!!! #Snow #BabyQue #SnowMan I truly adore you kid.""To many, it looked like a doting dad moment. But given the timing, others couldn’t help but see it as a calculated attempt to shift public perception.However, Deiondra wasn’t done. She fired back once again, posting: ""It's really sad to see family choose to NOT spend time with their grandson or nephew based off the hate for their mother. I'm so thankful for the family I have. I love Snow so much and will always protect him."" Her words made it clear that the core issue wasn’t just between her and Jacquees, but extended to his relatives allegedly turning their backs on Baby Snow due to their opinion of her.What’s striking is the contrast between both family circles. On Deiondra’s side, support beams from every angle. Her mother, Carolyne Chambers, her brother Bucky, and her iconic father Deion Sanders have all embraced Baby Snow wholeheartedly. In fact, the baby even shares a birthday with his grandfather, further bonding the two.This saga isn’t just celebrity drama—it’s a deeply personal battle over love, loyalty, and the complexities of co-parenting under a very public spotlight. What began as whispers around a breakup has now become a very real and raw story unfolding before our eyes, with a child’s emotional well-being hanging in the balance.Also Read: Patrick and Brittany Mahomes can’t stop smiling after son Bronze adorably says his real name on camera","The rift between Deiondra Sanders and Jacquees is no longer confined to vague posts or whispers.

Guide on obtaining Coca Leaves in Schedule 1

How to Make/cook Cocaine in Schedule 1 Game - How to use Cauldron

Unlocking Salvador Moreno

Purchasing Coca Seeds and cultivating into Coca Leaves

Harvesting and processing Coca Leaves

In Schedule 1 , you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire. When it comes to cocaine production, you will need to get Coca Leaves, which can be cultivated from Coca Seeds.However, these seeds aren’t readily available, and are a premium commodity. You will first have to unlock the exclusive dealer named Salvador Moreno, and then order these seeds from him. The guide below will walk you through the process of acquiring Coca Seeds, cultivating them into Coca Leaves, and processing them.To get started, you need to unlock Salvador Moreno, who is the exclusive supplier of Coca Seeds. The supplier operates from the Docks area, and you will have to reach the Enforcer I rank to unlock the same. To achieve the particular rank, you must expand your empire and successfully manage your operations in the other regions.After Docks is open for you, the next thing to do is establish connections with either Javier Perez or Mac Cooper. They will introduce you to Salvador Moreno, and you may then arrange the purchase of Coca Seeds in Schedule 1.As already stated, Coca Seeds are a premium commodity in Schedule 1, and you will have to pay the big bucks to acquire them. If you are ordering them through a dead drop, each seed will cost you $80, and there will be a purchase limit of $2,000 or 10 seeds per transaction. Alternatively, in-person purchases will require you to spend $150 per seed. These seeds will be a significant investment, so you must plan your finances correctly.Once you have got your hands on Coca Seeds, you must start with the cultivation. Planting them follows the same procedure as other seeds that you generally acquire from Albert. All you have to do is set up a grow tent or pot with soil, remove the seed cap, and plant the seed.If you've hired a Botanist in Schedule 1, the process becomes even easier. You must simply put the Coca Seed on an appropriate rack and assign the supplies. The Botanist will take up the entire growth process and would ensure optimal yield.You'll finally have mature Coca Leaves ready for harvest. After harvesting, you can transform these leaves into a sellable product by processing them in a Cauldron. The particular equipment is available upon reaching Enforcer I, and you can purchase it from Oscar for $3,000.Upon setting up the Cauldron, you can begin processing the Coca Leaves, with the standard recipe requiring 20 Coca Leaves and 1 unit of Gasoline. For a higher-quality output, you can also consider drying the Coca Leaves on a drying rack.Additionally, to completely streamline the production, you can consider hiring staff. A fully automated production for the particular drug requires you to have one Botanist, three Handlers, and four Chemists.","In Schedule 1, you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire.

Tyreek Hill is making headlines again for all the wrong reasons. A recent 911 call involving the Miami Dolphins wide receiver shines a harsh spotlight on another off-field controversy, highlighting serious domestic concerns at his Sunny Isles Beach home. With police now involved and family drama spilling into public view, Hill's future—both personal and professional—hangs uncomfortably in the balance.Tyreek Hill's mother-in-law, Alesia Vaccaro, made a distressing call to emergency services from the family's 35th-floor condo. In the leaked 911 audio, Vaccaro's panic is crystal clear. She pleads for help, audibly shaken, stating,and later,It's not a scene anyone wants to picture: Vaccaro frantic, Hill smashing a laptop, their daughter caught in the crossfire. The fact that Vaccaro explicitly mentions Hill's concern about jeopardizing his NFL career says a lot—maybe too much.Police reports confirm the severity of the scene. Witnesses noted Tyreek Hill tossing a laptop to the floor and grabbing his daughter during the argument. Despite claims from Hill and his wife, Keeta Vaccaro , that the incident remained non-physical, there's still the troubling detail of a visible bruise on Keeta’s chest. It paints a disturbing picture, no matter how Hill tries to spin it.Sports personality Dan Le Batard didn’t hold back on his show,. He openly admitted his regret for playing a part in Hill's Miami image makeover, calling out how the Dolphins and local media—including himself—softened Hill’s troubled history. Le Batard didn’t just express his regret; he practically tore himself apart live on air:He took Miami down with him too, saying bluntly:tty.""*Le Batard went further, addressing his guilt openly, even confronting his own reflection:He's right. Fans and media alike have given Hill pass after pass, turning a blind eye each time because the guy delivers touchdowns. The cognitive dissonance is real, and Le Batard calling himself out is refreshing—at least someone’s finally owning it.The NFL superstar's latest domestic incident isn't isolated. Tyreek Hill's issues trace back years—violence against women, disturbing patterns starting as far back as college. This latest police involvement, while resulting in no arrests or formal charges, already has his wife, Keeta Vaccaro, filing for divorce. TMZ Sports reported Keeta confirming the argument was sparked by her comment that TyreekHill responded bluntly to authorities:No matter how many yards he catches or touchdowns he scores, Tyreek Hill’s off-field controversies overshadow his star status. The Dolphins released a basic statement noting police left without incident, closing their case, but refusing further comment. Maybe they're hoping the buzz will fade—but honestly, how much longer can the NFL keep ignoring this?Hill led the league in receiving yards in 2023, yet it's impossible to celebrate his talent without feeling guilty. Fans and critics alike are done looking away. So, what's next? It's hard to say, but one thing’s certain: Tyreek Hill is running out of chances, and this latest scandal could finally be the breaking point.","Tyreek Hill's mother-in-law, Alesia Vaccaro, made a distressing call to emergency services from the family's 35th-floor condo.

Poll Should archaeological sites be preserved for historical and religious significance? Only if funds are available Absolutely, they are vital

Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden, aligning with biblical accounts . The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Poll Do you support the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for European visitors to the UK? No Yes

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

YouTube has introduced a new AI-powered music-making tool designed to help creators generate custom, royalty-free instrumental tracks for their videos. The feature, called Music Assistant, is part of YouTube's Creator Music marketplace and aims to simplify the process of adding high-quality background music to content.The Music Assistant tool allows creators to describe the type of music they need using simple text prompts. Users can specify details such as instruments, mood, and the type of video the music is for. Based on these inputs, the AI generates multiple music options, which creators can download and use without worrying about copyright claims.For example, creators can request ""calm and peaceful music with acoustic guitar and flowing piano"" or ""happy mood songs with good beats."" The tool provides granular control over the generated tracks, ensuring they align perfectly with the creator's vision.Currently, the Music Assistant is being rolled out to US-based creators who are part of the YouTube Partner Program and have access to the Creator Music marketplace. The tool builds on YouTube's earlier experiment, Dream Tracks, which focused on generating short music clips. Unlike Dream Tracks, Music Assistant is tailored for creating longer instrumental tracks suitable for a variety of video formats.The generated music is completely free to use, offering creators a cost-effective alternative to traditional licensing options. This feature is expected to reduce the time and effort spent on sourcing music, enabling creators to focus more on storytelling and content production.","YouTube has introduced a new AI-powered music-making tool designed to help creators generate custom, royalty-free instrumental tracks for their videos.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

Astrology hints at a family-focused future for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce

Astrological compatibility reveals why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce work so well

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s love story has taken center stage in the world of celebrity romances — and now, according to astrologer Inbaal Honigman, their cosmic alignment might be pointing toward the next big chapter: parenthood.With Swift, 35, and Kelce, also 35, going strong since their whirlwind romance began in mid-2023, speculation has swirled around what’s next for the high-profile couple. Now, astrology might be offering a clue. According to Honigman, August 2025 is shaping up to be a particularly transformative time for the duo.“August 2025 is a time for love for the glamorous couple,” Honigman shared in a recent interview with HELLO!. “Venus, which is the ruling planet of Libra, will be in the family-minded sign of Cancer between 31 July and 25 August.”Honigman also points to Jupiter’s influence, adding, “Jupiter, which is the ruling planet of Sagittarius, is in Cancer during those dates too, as well as before and after. Those dates will see Taylor and Travis focusing on their beloved families, as well as thinking of their future family. Baby news will soon arrive.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic, with both planetary alignments tied to themes of love, nurturing, and domestic bliss — all signs that could point to baby plans in the making.Beyond the baby buzz, Honigman offers insight into what makes Taylor and Travis such a strong match. Taylor, a Sagittarius, is described as adventurous and chaotic in the most charming way. “In love, Sagittarius is a fun-loving partner, and they look for a peaceful partner, who won't judge them when they're messy.”Travis, a Libra, balances that fire with calm, intellectual energy. “In love, Libra is a soothing partner, and they appreciate a mate who can let them be themselves,” Honigman says.Their dynamic is one of complementary energies. “Sagittarians like Taylor feel thankful when a Libra like Travis comes into their world and lets them hide away from the party,” she explains. “Librans like Travis can't help but love it when a Sagittarius like Taylor comes into their world and introduces them to absolutely everybody.”While the couple’s differing social preferences might bring the occasional challenge — with Taylor’s extroversion and Travis’s need for quiet — their deep admiration for each other creates harmony.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce just Taylor Swift’s next song title?

The real reason Taylor Swift avoids Coachella: Why the pop star's absence from the music festival continues to stand out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-real-reason-taylor-swift-avoids-coachella-why-the-pop-stars-absence-from-the-music-festival-continues-to-stand-out/articleshow/120163756.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Taylor Swift values structure over spontaneity

Each year, Coachella draws thousands of music lovers, celebrities, and influencers to the desert for a weekend of fashion, parties, and headline performances. With such a massive cultural presence, many wonder why one of the world’s biggest music stars, Taylor Swift, is almost never spotted at the festival—especially when she could easily steal the show. Unlike her fellow A-listers, Swift’s absence seems intentional rather than circumstantial.Coachella is known for its free-spirited energy, surprise performances, and unpredictable moments. But Taylor Swift has built her brand on precision and intentionality. Her tours, album drops, and public appearances are tightly orchestrated to maintain a certain level of control. Being part of an environment like Coachella, where chaos and spontaneity often rule, simply doesn’t align with her approach to her career—or her comfort zone.Swift has often spoken about the toll that public scrutiny and media narratives have taken on her over the years. In environments like Coachella, where paparazzi and social media are everywhere, it would be hard for her to move freely without becoming a spectacle. By staying away, she protects both her personal peace and the carefully curated image she’s worked hard to maintain.Coachella is also a place where celebrities blend into a crowd of influencers and brands all vying for attention. For Swift, who already commands global attention, being just another face in the VIP section may dilute her brand’s mystique. Her absence actually sets her apart—fans talk about it every year, wondering if she’ll ever make a surprise appearance.In contrast to pop-ups and casual collabs common at Coachella, Swift prefers meaningful, planned connections with her fans and the media. Her Eras Tour, for example, is a carefully curated experience that reflects her entire career arc, not just a moment in time.Also Read: New lawsuit against Taylor Swift: Travis Kelce's beau finds herself being accused of intellectual property theft By avoiding Coachella, Taylor Swift demonstrates her deep understanding of when and where her presence matters most. It’s not about missing out—it’s about maintaining control in a chaotic world.
