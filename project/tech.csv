Rhodes further revealed that he NEVER skips breakfast. For him, breakfast is the most essential meal of the day and he likes to have it first thing in the morning as part of his routine. Stressing on this fact, this former AEW EVP confided in the interviewer, “I'm an egg whites guy. Basic, dry wheat toast guy. I don't really have any breakfast meat because of the sodium and the added salt.” Cody further revealed that he prefers to avoid meat as part of his breakfast and likes to keep it really simple.The wrestler further revealed that he eats every three hours to keep his hunger pangs in check and to maintain a target calorie intake daily. He avoids having Korean beef or steak as it feels to heavy for him. Although, Cody prefers charbroiled chicken on the side of any type of rice, stating this combination to be his “comfort” food. “It's boring, but it's almost always white rice, grilled chicken and Thai peanut sauce.”Rhodes has further revealed that he absolutely hates vegetables. Although he is aware of their benefits for him. Consequently, Rhodes and his trainers have come up with a way to trick himself into having broccoli and other vegetables by simply hiding them in his meals. The WWE champion also revealed that he takes care of his calorie intake while travelling by making a few conscious food choices, like ordering food but asking them not to put mayonnaise on top, skip the buns, and even request for no oil in some foods. Since the athlete requires to move from one city to other more often, these few hacks have helped him in the long run.Since health is 70% diet and 30% workout and our wrestlers are no less, let us check out Cody's workout routine and training regime.The 38 years old part-Cuban wrestler had starred in an episode of Sheamus’ Celtic Warrior Workouts, where episode 127 was all about “Cody Cutter Workout”.

Microsoft said that it has started to resolve an outage affecting its Azure cloud service. The issue, according to the company, resulted from an unexpected usage surge. The outage is also said to have disabled mobile ordering at Starbucks for hours on Tuesday (July 30). Reports of outages on Azure and Microsoft 365 began to spike shortly after 7 a.m.Tuesday New York time (4.30 pm IST) and comprised hundreds of complaints at the incident’s peak, according to user reports compiled by Downdetector. The issue affected multiple Microsoft 365 services and features, Microsoft said in a post on social network X, formerly Twitter. Microsoft 365 includes common productivity apps like Outlook, Word and Excel.The Starbucks' app disruption is also reportedly connected to the issues affecting Microsoft Azure . Mobile ordering for Starbucks has largely been restored, according to a statement issued about 1 p.m. New York time. The company is working to address limited interruptions that continue, a spokesperson said.Microsoft said it will continue monitoring the situation until the outage has been resolved and will provide more updates throughout the afternoon.Starting approximately at 11:45 UTC on 30 July 2024, a subset of customers may have experienced issues connecting to Microsoft services globally. Current Status: An unexpected usage spike resulted in Azure Front Door (AFD) and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) components performing below acceptable thresholds, leading to intermittent errors, timeout, and latency spikes. We have implemented network configuration changes and have performed failovers to provide alternate network paths for relief. Our monitoring telemetry shows improvement in service availability from approximately 14:10 UTC onwards.We continue to investigate and mitigate reports of specific services and regions that are still experiencing intermittent errors. While our previous network configuration changes successfully mitigated the impacts of the usage spike, these changes caused side effects for a small number of services. Our updated mitigation approach has successfully reduced these impacts across regions in Asia Pacific and Europe. Our phased approach is now applying this same mitigation targeting regions in the Americas, and we expect that services should be fully mitigated by 20:30 UTC.We will provide an update on our continued mitigation efforts by 20:00 UTC, or sooner if we have progress to share.","Microsoft said that it has started to resolve an outage affecting its Azure cloud service.

The latest Deadpool & Wolverine movie has taken the theatres by a storm.

This was his second collaboration with Ryan Reynolds in a movie, with a prominent role in Free Guy being the first.Aaron Reed who was a part of FCW before it became NXT, played Juggernaut in the new Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.The character made it on-screen in what was more than a cameo, as he made an appearance on a semi-regular basis and got the chance to play an iconic X-Men villain .The wrestler took to his social media account to urge fans to watch the movie and wrote, ""Ahh Shitchya!! Get your ass to the theater and grab your popcorn. This movie is one you don’t want to miss. I’ll be viewing the movie from city to city. Starting tonight at the bell tower regal cinema Ft Myers FL. Come join, don’t be a sissy. For the poll do you want to see more of The Juggernaut? #deadpool #wolverine #juggernaut #marvel""In the movie X-Men: The Last Stand, the role of Juggernaut was taken on by Vinnie Jones. However, while the character was revived for Deadpool & Wolverine, Jones was replaced by Aaron Reed. Reed is better known by his WWE name, Lift Sawyer. However, his run in WWE was brief and ended about 15 years ago. Hall of Famer, Mike Rotunda had taken Reed under his wing, but his time with WWE only lasted for about a year.After retiring from WWE, Reed was diagnosed with Leukemia but ever since he made his recovery he launched a career in Hollywood. He played the muscular body-double of Ryan Reynolds in Free Guy. That was followed by his appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine.In an Instagram post, Aaron Reed opened up about battling Leukemia and becoming a stronger person. He shared, “I don’t do breakfast in bed. Here’s why. Being treated for leukemia I use to be stuck in this f***ing bed for months at a time. 4 years total. I was Forced to take pills and shots I never asked for that made me sick and lethargic. The shit was never ending. No matter how I tried I couldn’t escape the pain and solitude of this f***ing bed... Looking back I am glad it was this way for me. All I do is think about how I can be stronger and healthier all the time. I wanted to be a superhero.”He also added, “My mind was my escape, I would close my eyes and visualize myself walking by people and them looking at me in awe because of my size and shape. The image of myself eventually became its own identity that I talked to until I became him. Yet, people will still try to convince me there is a reason different from my mental fortitude as to why I had all my success and am living like a rock star and they can’t. Well here is your short answer. Weak people make excuses and strong make it happen.”","Aaron Reed played Juggernaut in the new Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.

'Indecent': Macron's awkward embrace with sports minister at Paris Olympics raises eyebrows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/indecent-macrons-awkward-embrace-with-sports-minister-at-paris-olympics-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/112152686.cms,"The internet is abuzz with discussions about photographs capturing a touchy-feely moment between French President Emmanuel Macron and his sports minister, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra , during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics . The images show the 46-year-old Macron firmly gripping the arm of Oudéa-Castéra, also 46 and a former professional tennis player, who serves as the country's minister of sports.In the photograph, Oudéa-Castéra reacts to the affectionate gesture by holding Macron's bicep with one hand while the other is draped around his neck while kissing.Adding to the awkwardness of the situation is the positioning of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who seems to be deliberately looking away.""Gabriel Attal, he pretends to look elsewhere! He doesn't know where to stand!"" one user commented.Another said, ""It's my lover that I'm kissing like this. Embarrassing.""A disapproving individual expressed, ""I find this photo indecent, it's not worthy of a president and a minister.""The intriguing photograph was brought to the public's attention by French magazine Madame Figaro, which described the kiss as ""strange"" and suggested that Oudéa-Castéra, also known as AOC in France, has a tendency to draw attention to herself.As the first Olympics in France in a century came to life, Oudéa-Castéra has been at the forefront of the event.Oudéa-Castéra recently swam in the Seine River to address concerns about elevated E coli levels in the iconic waterway, which is set to host several events during the upcoming games. However, a pre-race triathlon event scheduled for Sunday was called off due to water quality issues.In January, Macron appointed Oudéa-Castéra as France's education minister, but she was removed from the position in less than a month. This decision followed disclosures that she had enrolled her children in prestigious private schools and made critical comments about the public schools in her area.While some users on X expressed disapproval of the celebratory hug, not everyone shared the same sentiment.

This spot, although without a direct view of the initial action, was ideal for capturing the climax of the ride. Brouillet recounted his anticipation:""Every photographer is waiting for that. You know Gabriel Medina, especially at Teahupo'o, will kick off and do something. You know something is going to happen. The only tricky moment is where he is going to kick out? Because I'm blind! Sometimes he makes an acrobatic gesture and this time he did that and so I pushed the button.""""I think that when he was in the tube he knew that he was in one of the biggest waves of the day. He is jumping out of the water like 'man, I think this is a 10'.""Despite the brilliant shot, Brouillet remained cautious. ""When I'm shooting at Teahupo'o I don't shoot in such a high burst mode, because at the end of the day, if you push too hard on the button you come back with 5,000 shots in a day, and I don't like that! I got four shots of him out of the water and one of the four shots was this photo.""The image quickly gained widespread attention, being used by numerous publications globally and shared millions of times online. Australian media conglomerate .au hailed it as 'the greatest sports photo of all time,' while TIME magazine called it 'the defining image of triumph of the 2024 Summer Games .'Medina himself shared the photo on his Instagram account, where it rapidly garnered over 2.4 million likes.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Google Gemini may soon allow further editing of AI-generated images,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-gemini-may-soon-allow-further-editing-of-ai-generated-images/articleshow/112097581.cms,"Google brings this “Gemini's big upgrade” to free version

Google's AI model, Gemini, is poised to redefine image editing . According to recent reports, the tech giant is developing a new feature that will allow users to make precise modifications to AI-generated images .Currently, users often find themselves starting from scratch when they want to tweak an AI-generated image. However, this upcoming update is set to change that.With the new tool, users will be able to fine-tune images with greater precision, potentially altering elements like background, objects, or even the subject's appearance.Users can simply circle the desired area of an image with their finger or stylus and then provide text instructions for the desired changes. This intuitive approach eliminates the need for complex descriptions, as Gemini will automatically identify the selected region.While Google hasn't officially confirmed the feature, its potential implications are significant. If realised, this development could revolutionise the creative process for designers, artists, and content creators alike.Recently, Google has announced a significant upgrade to its Gemini AI chatbot. The company is introducing the Gemini 1.5 Flash large language model (LLM) to the free version of its chatbot, providing faster response times and enhanced accuracy.“Today we’re upgrading our free-tier experience to Gemini 1.5 Flash. With Gemini 1.5 Flash, you’ll notice across-the-board improvements in quality and latency, with especially noticeable improvements in reasoning and image understanding,” the company said.","Users will be able to circle the desired area of an image with their finger or stylus and then provide text instructions for the desired changes.

Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages. The tech giant is rolling out a new tool that simplifies the process of hiding individuals from appearing in Memories.As reported by Android Authority, Google is now making it easier to hide faces in Google Photos.Previously, users had to navigate through multiple menus to exclude specific people from their photo retrospectives. The new update promises a more streamlined approach, allowing users to directly hide a face from a photo's details page. This change is expected to make the process quicker and more intuitive.While Google hasn’t officially announced a release date for the new feature, it’s anticipated to be available to users in the coming months. This update comes as a welcome relief for many users who have expressed frustration over seeing unwanted faces in their Memories.To hide individuals from Memories in Google Photos, navigate to the app's settings menu, then go to Preferences > Memories, and select ""Hide people and pets."" This action will enable you to conceal individuals from appearing in your memories, creations, or on the search page without deleting any of the photos they are in.The report mentions that Google has simplified this process by reducing the number of steps. As per the APK teardown users will have to now open a photo and swipe to Metadata. After this, they just have to tap on three dots in the People section and tap on the hide face option. Users can choose to either reduce the frequency of a person's appearance or completely block them from showing up in any photo memories.","Google Photos is making a significant upgrade to its Memories feature, giving users more control over which faces appear in their nostalgic photo collages.

Anand Mahindra on AI: …is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anand-mahindra-on-ai-is-going-to-be-of-significantly-more-value-to-us-than-we-imagined/articleshow/112095975.cms,"How X users reacted to Anand Mahindra’s post

Anand Mahindra said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be of more value to mankind than ‘imagined’. Citing a research that showed how AI can detect breast cancer five years before it develops, he wrote ""If this is accurate, then AI is going to be of significantly more value to us than we imagined and much earlier than we had imagined,"".The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his views.Recently, a team of researchers from Duke University in the US developed a new AI model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk from mammograms.Traditional cancer diagnosis relies on biopsies, microscopic histological examinations, and imaging techniques like MRI, CT, and PET scans. Human interpretation of these tests can be subjective. AI, on the other hand, can analyse medical images with staggering accuracy.An IANS report quotes Vineet Nakra, a radiation oncologist at Max Super Speciality Hospital on how AI is helping in cancer diagnosis and treatment. She told the news agency that AI is helping pathologists diagnose cancer much faster and paving the way for doctors to make personalised and patient-centric cancer care.Commenting on Mahindra’s X post, a user wrote “That's the best use of technology anyway. Assisting human kind to become better and reduce risks”. “AI in the medical field will have a huge impact and will certainly make significant contributions. Google DeepMind's AI system, AlphaFold3, can accurately predict the 3D structure of proteins and has potential applications in drug discovery and understanding diseases,” commented another.“AI, Machine Learning, Big data analysis based systems will drastically improve the living standards of life of every strata of society,” replied a third.","The Mahindra Group chairman took to microblogging platform X to share his views.

How X’s auto-consent flouts tech rules in the UK, EU

Elon Musk-owned X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok. This means X can use user posts, interactions, and outputs from Grok for training and refining its AI, requiring users to manually opt-out. Now the regulators in the UK and the European Union ( EU ) have reportedly connected with the company over its alleged attempt to gain user consent for data harvesting without their approval.While X claims this data is essential for improving user experience, privacy concerns have been raised. The setting states that users “allow your posts as well as your interactions, inputs and results with Grok to be used for training and fine-tuning”.Users have expressed difficulty in disabling this feature as the option is currently hidden within the web app's settings and unavailable on the mobile app.The move contradicts the tech laws in both the regions as the regulations prohibit pre-ticked consent boxes. Tech companies are not allowed to use “pre-ticked boxes” or “any other method of default consent”.Data protection authorities in the UK and Ireland have expressed their concerns over X's actions, as per a report by the Guardian. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating the matter, emphasising the importance of transparency and user choice in data usage.“Platforms seeking to use their users’ data to train their AI foundation models must be transparent about their activities,” said a spokesperson for the ICO.“They should take steps to proactively notify users well in advance of using data for these purposes, and provide people with ample time and simple processes to object to having their data used in this way,” the spokesperson added.Similarly, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), the lead regulator for X in the EU, has expressed surprise at the development and is seeking further information from the company.“The DPC has been engaging with X on this matter for a number of months, with our latest interaction occurring as recently as yesterday, therefore we are surprised by today’s developments. We have followed up with X today (July 26) and are awaiting a response. We expect further engagement early next week,” said Graham Doyle, a DPC deputy commissioner.","X recently enabled by default a setting that allows the social media platform to utilise user data to train its AI model, Grok.
