What aspect of the WWE is The Undertaker concerned about?

WWE, Netflix, & John Cena's Farewell: Undertaker Talks Wrestling's Future | Six Feet Under #49

Also read:

The Undertaker has been and continues to be one of the most prominent faces in the WWE . He’s seen the company undergo multiple transformations over his long and illustrious career and has made a lot of contributions to the company and the world of professional wrestling as a whole.Over the years, the company has evolved considerably and has seen the leadership change hands from Vince McMohan to Paul “Triple H” Levesque. While the former’s leadership has had a lot of problems, The Undertaker has expressed his concerns about another worrying trend that has appeared with Triple H’s way of running the company.Under Triple H’s leadership, the overall stress on the wrestlers has decreased considerably which has lead The Undertaker to worry about the overall effectiveness of this current stance that the company has.Speaking on the Six Feet Under podcast, The Undertaker aired this concern of his. He said, “Iron sharpens iron. You need those reps to keep your body and skills sharp. It’s hard to stay sharp when you’re only working four or five matches a month.” These comments are with respect to the current schedule that WWE wrestlers follow.Under the new leadership, the wrestlers have a much more lenient schedule. During the holiday season, there are double tapings, so wrestlers get a lot of time off, plus leaves are easier to get by these days. Furthermore the live event schedule mostly focuses on midcard wrestlers, as stars are limited to tapings and dark matches only, which takes a lot of load off them.With wrestlers having more time off which allows them to spend more time with family, The Undertaker is concerned that this easy schedule may make the wrestlers sloppy when it comes to executing moves in the ring.He’s also suggested that the company needs to put out more experiments at live events, rather than having something broadcast on tapings, and then having them falling flat on the face.That said, the company has just made an appearance on Netflix with WWE RAW, which is considered as a huge move for the company and the world of professional wrestling as a whole. It’ll be interesting to see how things pan out and if this new schedule affects the quality of performance that the wrestlers put out.","The Undertaker has expressed his concerns about the current WWE schedule.

A Politically Charged Setting



Online Backlash and Defence



“Worst Nazi Ever”



In response to claims that Elon Musk had a made a Nazi salute, social media users flooded X (formerly known as Twitter) with images of various celebrities including Taylor Swift, fictional characters like Superman and Spock, and Democrats like AOC, Obama and Clinton, giving the Nazi salute.While celebrating Donald Trump’s political victory and discussing future space exploration, Musk made a sweeping motion accompanied by the phrase, “My heart goes out to you.” To his supporters, this was a heartfelt expression of gratitude. However, critics argued that the motion resembled the notorious “Heil Hitler” salute, fuelling widespread backlash online.One user on X (formerly Twitter) commented, “Elon just did a full Nazi salute, can’t help himself.” Another wrote, “I used to overlook Musk’s antics for the sake of space exploration, but this I can no longer ignore.”Supporters of Musk were quick to refute these claims, with many dismissing them as unfounded. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro voiced his frustration, tweeting, “You stupid f***ing idiots,” encapsulating the indignation felt by many of Musk’s defenders.The speech took place against a politically charged backdrop, celebrating Trump’s recent electoral triumph and Musk’s vision for humanity’s future on Mars. “The future of civilisation is assured,” Musk declared to cheers from the audience. “Can you imagine how incredible it will be when American astronauts plant our flag on another planet?”Despite the focus on ambitious space exploration, the controversy surrounding Musk’s gesture stole the spotlight. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) weighed in, criticising those defending Musk. She tweeted, “Just to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis. People can officially stop listening to you as any reputable source of information.”While critics accused Musk of promoting far-right ideologies, his defenders dismissed the claims as an orchestrated smear campaign. Conservative commentator Avi Yemini sarcastically remarked, “Notice how every real Jew-hater on this platform is pretending that Elon Musk gave a Nazi salute.”Others highlighted the broader context, suggesting that the outrage was a distraction. One user tweeted, “They are upset because both JD Vance and Trump emphasised that there is no place for antisemitism in the MAGA movement. Now they are trying to harm the MAGA movement with false claims.”Amidst the heated debate, some users opted for humour to address the situation. Chaya Raichik quipped, “Worst Nazi ever,” downplaying the accusations and underscoring the perceived absurdity of the claims.As the debate rages on, it remains a polarising issue, with supporters and critics offering vastly differing interpretations of the controversial moment.","Elon Musk made a gesture during a speech celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

This case highlights the dangers of emotional manipulation and online fraud, particularly targeting vulnerable individuals through social media platforms.According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a Chinese influencer, Mao from Shaanxi province, has been arrested for emotionally manipulating a 70-year-old Shanghai woman, Tang, into transferring 560,000 yuan (approximately Rs 66 lakh) by pretending to be her son. Mao gained Tang's trust through emotional stories, claiming personal hardships like cancer and family emergencies. Over time, he addressed her as ""mum"" and created a fabricated bond with her, asking for money to cover his supposed needs.Despite her relatives raising suspicions about the suspicious transactions, Tang continued to send money because she was desperate to help her ""son."" Mao even traveled 1,000 km to meet her and filmed the encounter to strengthen his deception. However, when his behavior became erratic and manipulative, Tang grew suspicious and contacted authorities in late 2023, ending the scam.Investigators uncovered a complex web of deception after an elderly woman, Tang, was defrauded of 560,000 yuan (around Rs 66 lakh) by a Chinese influencer, Mao. Mao used four different accounts to maintain his fake identities, pretending to be various people. His downfall came when Tang unknowingly took a photo of his car’s license plate, which helped authorities track him down. After collecting evidence, Mao was arrested in Shanghai and sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison with a 100,000 yuan fine (approximately Rs 11 lakh).Tang, living on a modest pension, fell deeply into debt due to Mao’s manipulative tactics, owing over 70,000 yuan (around Rs 8 lakh). Despite the court offering financial support, Tang refused help, and the emotional toll led her to lose 10 kgs in six months, revealing the profound impact the scam had on her health.","Chinese influencer sentenced to 10 years for scamming elderly woman of Rs 66 lakh. 70-year-old Shanghai woman, Tang, was defrauded of 560,000 yuan by a Chinese influencer.

CM Punk to WWE: Real or Rumor?

The pro wrestling world thrives on speculation and rumors, and the latest buzz has fans talking about potential returns, training updates, and unexpected shifts in the industry. From Corey Graves possibly stepping back into the ring to Jade Cargill honing her craft, let’s break down these hot topics and explore what they could mean for the future of wrestling.Rumors have been swirling that Corey Graves, WWE commentator and former wrestler, may be considering an in-ring return. Graves, who was forced to retire in 2014 due to concussion issues, recently teased fans with cryptic social media posts and offhand comments during WWE broadcasts.Reports suggest that Graves has been medically cleared for some time, and the idea of him returning to active competition has been discussed internally. If true, this would be a huge development, as Graves was known for his charisma and technical ability in NXT before his early retirement. Graves could be looking at a one-off match or a limited run to capitalize on nostalgia while protecting his health. A Royal Rumble surprise entry or a WrestleMania storyline would be a perfect way to reintroduce him to the ring.Since signing with WWE, Jade Cargill has been the talk of the town. The former AEW star is reportedly undergoing intense training at WWE’s Performance Center, with insiders claiming that the company sees her as a major star in the making.Cargill’s natural charisma and unmatched physical presence make her a perfect fit for WWE’s larger-than-life presentation. However, WWE is reportedly taking its time to ensure she’s polished and prepared before debuting on a grand stage. Jade’s training could be aimed at preparing her for a high-profile debut, potentially at WrestleMania or a marquee NXT event. WWE may be looking to position her as a dominant force in the women’s division, possibly even fast-tracking her to the main roster.Another major name in the rumor mill is Randy Orton. The Viper has been sidelined for over a year due to a severe back injury, leaving fans eager to know when—or if—he’ll return. Recent reports indicate that Orton has been seen training and looking in great shape, sparking hope for his comeback.While no official date has been confirmed, there’s heavy speculation that Orton could return at a major event like the Royal Rumble. With WrestleMania season approaching, his presence would be a massive boost to WWE’s star power. If Orton does return soon, expect him to be thrust into a top storyline. A reunion with Riddle or a feud with a rising star could be on the cards, depending on WWE’s creative direction.The wrestling world is buzzing about the possibility of CM Punk making a sensational return to WWE after his controversial exit from AEW. Reports suggest there have been internal discussions, but no concrete plans have surfaced yet.Punk’s tumultuous history with WWE makes this a polarizing topic, but his undeniable drawing power might make WWE consider bringing him back, especially during a competitive time for the industry. If Punk does return, it could happen at a major event like the Royal Rumble or WrestleMania, with potential feuds against Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, or even Cody Rhodes being dream matches fans would clamor to see.Also Read: Who is Bishop Dyer? The rumors swirling around Corey Graves, Jade Cargill, Randy Orton, and CM Punk highlight the ever-changing and unpredictable nature of professional wrestling. While nothing is set in stone, the possibility of these developments has fans excited for what’s next.

Who is Becky Lynch’s Mother?

Rebecca Quin, better recognized by her ring name Becky Lynch has led a successful wrestling career spanning over two decades. Lynch’s family has been a major support to her ambition, from beginning training for wrestling with her brother, Richy Quin, to having her father, Ken Quin, as the inspiration to start wrestling. Lynch’s mother has been no stranger when it comes to wrestling, she never stepped inside the ring, however, has been a major crush for WWE icons like Big E and Sheamus. Here’s more information about Becky Lynch’s familyAnne Quin is the mother of Becky Lynch, she gave birth to Lynch on 30 January, 1987. A year after Lynch was born, Anne went separate ways from her husband and Lynch’s biological father, Ken Quin. Lynch has shared her views about how her mother has not always been the most supportive when it comes to her wrestling career and has even asked her to leave wrestling when the latter took a 7-year long break. Whereas, her father alike her mother became the inspiration behind Lynch pursuing a wrestling career.Lynch has mentioned in her memoir, The Man, how her goal-driven mother never had the time for dreams and how this made it difficult for her to convince her mother of the lifestyle a pro wrestler lives. However, this changed with time when Lynch’s mother saw the dedication and hard work she was putting to be at the top of her career. In today’s time Lynch has a harmonious relationship with her mother since after giving birth to her and Seth Rollins ’ daughter, Roux, she realises the maternal instinct too.There was once a post made on Lynch’s Instagram account to show gratitude towards her mother on mother’s day and a few WWE legends were taken aback by Quin’s beauty in the picture. Big E went ahead to comment on “A Whole Meal,” and Sheamus took it up a notch and commented, “Why he started drinking Harp.” These flirtatious comments were amusingly surprising and humorous towards Quin on Lynch’s post.Not even the WWE iconic wrestlers deny the charm Lynch’s mother has and we cannot lie but agree to how similar Lynch looks to her mother when she would have been in her prime years. Stars like Becky Lynch rise to fame because they come from equally career driven parents and supportive siblings.ALSO READ: Becky Lynch and WWE: When is Her Return Set To Happen?","Rebecca Quin, better recognized by her ring name Becky Lynch has led a successful wrestling career spanning over two decades.

Is Elias coming back to WWE Programming anytime soon?

Kevin Owens makes Ezekiel admit he’s Elias

Also read:

Over the years, WWE has improved as a place of work, and under the leadership of Triple H, it’s become a place where everyone looks forward to work at. However, many wrestlers have also left the company in an attempt to secure a future elsewhere, because the company didn’t want to renew their contracts for a myriad of reasons.One such wrestler is Elijah better known as Elias, during his stint with the company. After multiple runs with the company under different gimmicks, he’s not a part of the company anymore, and currently performs on the independent circuit.At this point, it’s hard to say if Elias is coming back to WWE programming at this point in time. He’s currently working his way through the independent circuit and has put up some really amazing matches on the circuit so far, but is yet to make an impression that is good enough to get him back with the Stamford-based promotion.However, he didn’t quit the company on bad terms, and thus isn’t writing off a return to WWE at all. During an event with K&S Wrestling , he reminisced about his time with the Stamford-based promotion. Speaking about his experience, he said, “I thought it was awesome, a lot of great stuff. I had a lot of incredible, very memorable moments for me personally and probably for a lot of people. I loved it. Elias can and could and should do so much more in WWE. They only scratched the surface with my capabilities. I had a lot of great moments, some incredible guys to go up against.”He also addressed his potential return to the company by saying, ““I’d love that. Look, you see how the business works by now. You could be gone, Carlito was gone for ten years, look at Drew [McIntyre]. These things happen, for sure. Everybody has their own little story. I’m not writing it off. It’s not immediate, man, I gotta do that. But if the opportunities come up, sure, we’ll see.”Considering these statements, it’s believed that the company hasn’t reached out to him yet. But it’s also safe to say that WWE wrestlers have done exceptionally well after joining the company for the second time around. So, how he performs once he makes a comeback to the company, if at all he does, remains to be seen.","Elijah, better known as Elias, is currently working his way through the independent circuit.
