Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL GOAT took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”As the former couple continues to co-parent in the public eye, the disparity in their public gestures reveals the complexities that come with navigating life post-divorce—especially when the world is always watching. She may not like to show what's there after starting a complete new life!Also Read: Tom Brady once choked up as he admitted he wasn’t as good a father as his own dad: ""When I think about being a dad...""",Gisele Bündchen did not post on her social media for Father's Day.

Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-chip company, has implanted its brain-computer interface (BCI) in a sixth person. The update came from Rob Grenier, who shared his experience on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) earlier this week. ""Absolutely amazing what I can do already in under a week with Neuralink!"" Grenier posted, along with a video showing him playing a computer game and moving a cursor using only his thoughts.Grenier became quadriplegic after a car accident in December 2022. The incident left him paralyzed from the neck down. “I can't thank the Neuralink team, the doctors, the surgeons and all of my family and friends' support. It may only look like I'm doing a couple games but it's been under a week and I'm already shocked!” he added in the post.The announcement comes as Neuralink raised over $650 million in its Series E funding round, bringing its valuation to $9 billion. The Series E round attracted major investors including ARK Invest, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, and several others, valuing the company at approximately $9 billion pre-money according to recent reports. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is among the company’s major backers.The funding represented a significant increase from Neuralink's $280 million Series D round in August 2023.Neuralink has launched clinical trials at leading medical institutions across three countries, including Barrow Neurological Institute, The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami, University Health Network in Toronto, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.It is now preparing for a human trial of its Blindsight chip in partnership with the UAE's Cleveland Clinic in 2026.Musk had earlier said, “With Neuralink interfacing directly to the visual cortex, even those who are completely blind will be able to see again.”",Rob Grenier became quadriplegic after a car accident in December 2022.

Google’s Veo 3 to enhance Shorts content creation

Alcatel V3 Ultra Unboxing & Hands-on | Dual Display Mode, Sleek Design & More!

YouTube will integrate Google’s latest AI video generation model, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this year, CEO Neal Mohan announced. Speaking at a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival, Mohan said “The possibilities with AI are limitless”. He was joined by creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum. “A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution,” Mohan added.YouTube currently uses an earlier version of Veo in its Dream Screen feature, which creates AI-generated backgrounds. Veo 3 marks a major upgrade, offering more advanced video creation tools. Google released the Veo 3 tool last month at I/O 2025. The AI-powered video generation tool allows users to generate videos from text and image prompts.Mohan said the new tool will “open new creative lanes” for Shorts creators, helping them experiment with content formats. YouTube Shorts, launched in 2021, now sees over 200 billion views per day, according to Mohan. Its growing popularity puts it in direct competition with TikTok and Instagram Reels.Mohan emphasized the role of creators in shaping modern entertainment. “My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he said.“Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”","YouTube will integrate Google’s latest AI video generation model, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this year, CEO Neal Mohan announced.

AI Godfather’s urgent warning: Want job security? Learn plumbing

A personal warning from the AI Godfather

Office jobs face AI pressure, says ‘Godfather of AI’

Growing inequality could be the real problem

A future that’s still unwritten

In a world moving quickly toward automation, one of the creators of modern artificial intelligence is raising serious concerns about what happens next. Geoffrey Hinton , the British-Canadian computer scientist often called the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk—and which ones might survive.Hinton, who helped lay the foundation for AI systems that now power everything from chatbots to medical tools, left his role at Google in 2023. Since then, he’s been speaking more freely about the risks of the technology he helped create. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett, Hinton discussed the future of work in a world shaped by powerful machines. And in a surprising turn, he said there’s one career path that may be safer than most: plumbing.While talking about the risks of AI, Hinton made a simple point: machines are good at thinking, not at fixing pipes. “It’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us,” he said. “A good bet would be to be a plumber.”Plumbing is hard to automate. It involves manual skill, real-world judgment, and problem-solving in unpredictable settings. A plumber might need to crawl under a sink, deal with unusual water pressure, or fix something without a manual. These aren’t tasks AI systems are built to handle.According to Hinton, jobs that rely on hands-on skills are less likely to be taken over by AI anytime soon. While machines can handle large amounts of data and even draft documents, they still can’t climb ladders or tighten valves. That gives trade jobs—especially ones like plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry—an edge in the AI era.Now 77, Hinton didn’t try to hide how conflicted he feels. He admitted that he’s still processing the full consequences of his work. “Intellectually, you can see the threat,” he said. “But it’s very hard to come to terms with it emotionally.”He said he worries about the future his children and grandchildren might face. In the interview, he painted a picture that was both realistic and unsettling. He talked about a world where AI systems could eventually control power plants and critical infrastructure. If these systems become fully independent, they may not need people at all.“If AI ever decided to take over,” he warned, “it would need people for a while to run the power stations—until it designed better analog machines… There are so many ways it could get rid of people, all of which would, of course, be very nasty.”Hinton didn’t say this will happen. But he made it clear that it could. And in his view, that’s reason enough to take it seriously.While plumbers may be safe for now, Hinton believes many office jobs won’t be. He pointed to legal assistants and paralegals as some of the first roles being reshaped by AI.These jobs often involve reviewing contracts, analyzing documents, or summarizing information—all tasks that large language models can already handle. With AI tools now able to draft legal text and even predict case outcomes, the need for human support roles in law firms could shrink.Hinton wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He was simply stating what the data shows. “In a society which shared out things fairly, everybody should be better off,” he said. “But if you can replace lots of people by AIs, then the people who get replaced will be worse off.”In other words, the shift may boost productivity, but it might not help everyone equally.Beyond the risks of job loss, Hinton pointed to a deeper issue: inequality. As companies adopt AI, many workers may be pushed out, while only a small group—those who own or run these companies—stand to benefit.If not managed carefully, this could lead to a wider gap between rich and poor. People in manual jobs may still find work, but others—especially those in mid-level white-collar roles—may struggle to adapt.And while AI might create new jobs, Hinton warned that the pace of change could be too fast for many to keep up.Hinton’s message wasn’t meant to scare people. It was meant to make them think. He didn’t claim to know how the future will unfold. But he said it’s time to have an honest conversation about what’s coming.For now, the most valuable skills may not be digital ones—but physical ones. Fixing a leak, rewiring a switchboard, or installing a water heater might be harder to replace than people think.And that’s something worth remembering.","Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk.

They look just like real babies: Why reborn dolls are becoming so popular in the UAE?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/they-look-just-like-real-babies-why-reborn-dolls-are-becoming-so-popular-in-the-uae/articleshow/121930584.cms,"Each doll comes with clothes, bottles, diapers, a stroller, and even a car seat making them feel just like the real thing./ Image: Instagram @UAE.Doll





In the UAE, a unique trend is capturing attention, hyper-realistic baby dolls known as “reborn dolls.” These dolls look, feel, and weigh almost exactly like real babies but are entirely artificial. Increasingly, residents are purchasing them for various reasons: as collectors’ items, therapeutic aids, or simply for the novelty of their astonishing lifelike design.The rising popularity of reborn dolls in the UAE is reflected in the expanding customer base and shifting price points. A local seller operating under the Instagram account uae.doll shared her insights with local news outlet KT, explaining that prices currently range between Dh300 and Dh500. This marks a significant drop compared to the early days when these dolls first entered the market.“I started importing reborn dolls from Spain and noticed huge interest when I displayed them on Instagram,” she told KT. “The demand was so high that I began offering them regularly. Later, lower-quality versions became available from Chinese markets at more affordable prices.”Her clientele is notably diverse, spanning children, mothers, grandmothers, and even young men who sometimes purchase the dolls as gifts for their fiancées.Every doll comes equipped with a full range of accessories, including extra clothes, hairbands, bottles, diapers, a bag, stroller, and even a car seat.She added, “We began this business in 2014 when the dolls were much more expensive, starting from Dh2,000 and imported mainly from Spain and the United States.”Reborn dolls have not only found a place in private collections but have also become a social media phenomenon. Enthusiasts openly share their passion online, sometimes bringing the dolls into public spaces. One Instagram user posted near the Burj Khalifa, stating: “I already have four reborns and now we are in Dubai with the newest, his name is Chase.”Yet, the dolls’ striking realism can sometimes provoke discomfort. Sara, a 27-year-old Dubai resident, shared with KT that her curiosity led her to buy a reborn doll but she ultimately gave it away. “It looked so real that it started to freak me out, especially at night,” she said. “There were times I’d walk into the room and feel like there was an actual baby just lying there. I couldn’t handle it.”In contrast, some view reborn dolls as valuable educational tools. Layla, a mother from Sharjah, recently bought one for her nine-year-old daughter. “She’s been asking for a baby sister for years,” Layla explained. “This was the closest I could offer, and honestly, it’s helping. She changes the diaper, feeds it, puts it to sleep. It’s teaching her a sense of responsibility and care.”Both women agree on one thing: the level of detail is astonishing. From the doll’s weight to tiny eyelashes and hand-painted skin tones, and the incredibly realistic, indistinguishable hair, with every feature is crafted to mimic a real baby. Reborn dolls blur the line between a toy and lifelike art.The reborn doll phenomenon extends far beyond the UAE. Internationally, these dolls have sparked fascination and controversy, particularly in countries like Brazil. There, the hyper-realistic dolls serve multiple purposes, including grief therapy for individuals coping with loss and as practical tools for new parents learning infant care.The dolls have become a frequent topic on social media, attracting both devoted fans and critical observers. In Brazil, the trend has even spurred political debate. Some lawmakers have proposed restrictions on reborn dolls, citing concerns, while others defend the rights of collectors to engage freely with them.Reports have surfaced of owners bringing reborn dolls to hospitals and demanding real infant care, a phenomenon that has raised eyebrows and fueled further discussion.","In the UAE, a unique trend is capturing attention, hyper-realistic baby dolls known as “reborn dolls” These dolls look, feel, and weigh almost exactly like real babies but are entirely artificial. Increasingly, residents are purchasing them for various reasons: as collectors’ items, therapeutic aids, or simply for the novelty of their astonishing lifelike design.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121932055,imgsize-1170568,width-400,resizemode-4/121932055.jpg"

Engaging in fraudulent activities and sorcery with unknown individuals (whose phone numbers were later traced),



Endangering others,



Violating personal privacy by transmitting private images through WhatsApp,



Illegally possessing and distributing private materials.









A man in the UAE has been sentenced to six months in prison after being convicted of engaging in sorcery and violating the privacy of his estranged wife and her family. The Fujairah Court of Appeal upheld the initial ruling, which also included the confiscation and destruction of materials seized during the investigation.The case came to light after the wife filed a police report, accusing her husband of using black magic against her, their children, and her relatives. Her suspicions were confirmed when she was contacted by a spiritual healer who provided her with WhatsApp messages and photos that directly implicated her husband.According to a report by, the husband admitted during police interrogation that he had gone online in search of someone who could cast love spells to restore his failing marriage. He found a woman from another Arab country promoting herself on social media as an expert in “bringing back loved ones.” He contacted her via WhatsApp and paid her Dh20,000. As part of the ritual, he sent her personal images of his wife, a video of himself, and their phone numbers.Things took a turn when the woman demanded an additional Dh25,000. When he refused, she threatened to expose his actions by sending the compromising content to his wife.Undeterred by the threat, the man turned to another practitioner, paying Dh10,000 for a second attempt at spellwork. When that too failed, he contacted a third woman who didn’t initially request money, but before anything could proceed further, he was apprehended by authorities.Meanwhile, the wife had already moved out of their home two months earlier and had initiated divorce proceedings due to alleged abuse. Her suspicions regarding her husband's use of sorcery were further confirmed when a woman, believed to be connected to the earlier “spiritual healer,” contacted her from outside the UAE and offered evidence of his actions for Dh35,000. Refusing to pay without seeing proof, the wife was sent photos, a video, and images of magical rituals. These materials were handed over to the police.The Public Prosecution brought four formal charges against the man:These charges fell under the UAE’s cybercrime and fraud laws and were classified as misdemeanors.The initial court found the evidence compelling and handed down a six-month prison sentence, along with an order to confiscate and destroy the incriminating digital materials. The man appealed the ruling, denying all charges in court. However, the appellate court rejected his claims, citing clear evidence and sound legal reasoning in the original verdict.The appeal was dismissed, and the six-month jail sentence was officially upheld by the Fujairah Court of Appeal. The case has garnered public attention for highlighting the intersection of digital privacy, superstition, and the misuse of technology in personal relationships.No further charges were reported against the spiritual healers involved, though their identities and phone numbers were part of the investigation. The court’s final decision underlined the UAE’s firm stance against sorcery, fraud, and cyber-enabled privacy violations.","A man in the UAE has been sentenced to six months in prison after being convicted of engaging in sorcery and violating the privacy of his estranged wife and her family.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Orphaned cheetahs named Taylor and Travis find comfort—and love—in each other

In a heartwarming twist straight out of a fairy tale, two orphaned cheetah cubs rescued from the illegal wildlife trade are making headlines—not just for surviving, but for thriving together. Named Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce , the adorable duo has formed an inseparable bond at a conservation center in Somaliland, sparkling smiles and a wild ‘Love Story’ of their own.At the Cheetah Conservation Fund's sanctuary, a heartwarming narrative of friendship and survival is playing out. It all began with a tiny cheetah cub, fittingly named Taylor Swift in a nod to the beloved popstar superstar.This resilient cub, weighing a mere three pounds upon her arrival this past April, was a lucky rescue from the clutches of the illegal wildlife pet trade. Brought to the Cheetah Rescue and Conservation Centre in Somaliland, she swiftly adapted to her secure new home, thriving under the dedicated care provided by the staff.The center recently welcomed four new residents—a litter of orphaned siblings, also saved from the same unfortunate circumstances of illegal wildlife trafficking. These new arrivals were gently introduced to Taylor Swift once they had settled into their new surroundings.Among them, a particular male cub quickly caught Taylor's attention, and a significant bond began to blossom between the two.Observing this flourishing friendship, the staff at the cheetah center made a charming and fitting decision: they named the 5-month-old male cub Travis Kelce, inspired by the well-known athlete. According to the center, this cheetah, Travis Kelce, embodies qualities similar to his namesake, described as ""playful, confident, and has a winning streak.”The delightful bond between the two cubs has not gone unnoticed. As the center's staff shared in a statement, ""Not only is [cub Taylor Swift] thriving, it looks like we have a little Love Story unfolding on the savannah."" They further emphasized the depth of the two cub's connection, stating, ""The two have become nearly inseparable—grooming each other, napping side by side, and occasionally partaking in friendly roughhousing. ""The male cub's ""rookie stats"" include an approximate sitting height of 50 cm and a length of about 90 cm, along with impressive abilities like ""climbing trees, running fast [and] scarfing down snacks."" It's clear that this young male cheetah is also ""fiercely protective of the things he likes most,"" a sentiment that undeniably includes his dear friend, Taylor Swift, the cheetah cub.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift inspire each other to grow as Erin Andrews dubs her with sweet new nickname Isn't it amazing how these two rescued cubs found each other and formed such a special bond? As these two ""superstar"" cheetahs thrive together, their story reminds us that sometimes, the most unexpected pairings lead to the most enduring love stories.Recently, teh American popstar Taylor Swift visited Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. and talked with some patients who were huge Swifties. When a patient asked her why she was there in Florida, the pop singer had an adorable response, “My boyfriend is training here. So I just thought I’d come and see how you’re doing.
