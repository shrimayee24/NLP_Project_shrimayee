Gracie Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs heiress, recently shared an experience that made her rethink how she approaches her health and self-care. During a visit to Medici Health in Austin, she underwent a comprehensive wellness assessment that went far beyond routine checkups, prompting reflections on the importance of taking care of the whole body before any issues arise. The visit highlighted how modern, holistic healthcare can be both enlightening and empowering, even for someone accustomed to high-profile lifestyles.Gracie described her visit as “eye-opening,” emphasizing how the assessment covered everything from heart screenings and bloodwork to vision and hearing tests. “It really reminded me how important it is to take care of our whole selves, not just to wait until something feels wrong,” she shared. Her experience underscores a growing awareness among individuals that true wellness is about more than just addressing immediate problems—it’s about understanding your body inside and out before issues arise.What set Gracie’s visit apart, she said, was the compassion and attentiveness of the team. “The team made it such a thoughtful and encouraging experience,” she reflected, pointing to Dr. Vo and the staff who ensured every step of the process was comfortable, informative, and reassuring.Their approach transforms what might normally feel clinical into a personalized journey, emphasizing both physical health and emotional confidence.Gracie also highlighted the vision behind Medici Health, praising the Phillips family for their dedication to holistic wellness. “The Phillips family behind Medici has the biggest heart for transforming lives from the inside out, and so many of us are truly blessed by you,” she said. Their mission demonstrates how modern healthcare can combine innovation with empathy, creating a model that inspires patients to be proactive about their health.The post drew an immediate response from her mother, Tavia Hunt, who commented, “An incredibly impressive and thorough healthcare experience!!🙌🏼💯” This interaction highlights the role family support plays in encouraging personal wellness. Health journeys become more meaningful when shared and celebrated, reinforcing positive behaviors across generations.Gracie Hunt’s reflections offer a powerful lesson: wellness is a continuous, proactive journey. Her eye-opening experience at Medici Health reminds readers that holistic assessments, compassionate care, and forward-thinking healthcare innovation can make a profound difference. It’s a call to view health not as something to monitor only when problems arise but as a dynamic, ongoing practice that benefits both body, and mind. And in Gracie's words and actions, it's clear that prioritizing wellness isn't just a lifestyle choice-it's a lifelong commitment to truly living well. Her journey stands as a gentle reminder that investing in our health today is the most meaningful gift we can give our future selves. Because sometimes, the most powerful transformations begin not on the outside- but within.Also read: Fans can't get enough of Peter, Kirk Herbstreit’s adorable golden retriever, who stole smiles and hearts at Rams vs. 49ers","Gracie Hunt, the Kansas City Chiefs heiress, recently shared an experience that made her rethink how she approaches her health and self-care.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Among them will be approximately 200 participants from the UAE, including community runners, students, and representatives from various humanitarian and cultural organisations.The Rio race will also welcome over 250 international delegations, making it a powerful symbol of global unity under the banner of sport and giving. Officials from both the UAE and Brazil have noted that the event not only celebrates fitness but also strengthens bilateral ties through community engagement and goodwill.The run will feature two main routes a 5km family-friendly course and a 10km competitive race. Both are designed to be inclusive and accessible, encouraging participation from all age groups and fitness levels. Whether participants are seasoned athletes or first-time runners, the focus remains on togetherness and purpose, not just performance. The scenic routes will likely pass through some of Rio’s most recognizable landmarks, offering runners sweeping ocean views and a festive, carnival-like atmosphere along the course. Entertainment stations, cultural performances, and local volunteer groups are expected to add to the energy of the day.The Zayed Charity Run is one of the UAE’s most successful humanitarian sports initiatives, launched to honor the legacy of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding Father of the UAE. It reflects his vision of humanity, compassion, and community service through action not just words.The event began in Abu Dhabi in 2001 as a local race aimed at promoting health and social responsibility. Over the years, it evolved into an international movement that combines fitness, philanthropy, and diplomacy. Each edition raises funds for hospitals, medical research, and welfare programs in its host city all under the spirit of “giving without borders.” Unlike commercial races, the Zayed Charity Run’s core niche is humanitarian impact. Every stop donates its proceeds directly to local causes, from cancer treatment in Egypt to children’s hospitals in New York and now family welfare in Rio. The initiative has previously supported organisations such as the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, Children’s Cancer Hospital in Cairo, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.The goal is simple yet powerful: ""Use running as a bridge between nations and people, promoting health and kindness through collective action""Beyond the race itself, the Rio event is explicitly charitable: proceeds will support local organizations that help vulnerable children, women and families including partnerships with community groups such as Rio Solidario. The National and other coverage note that funds raised at the Rio stop will be channelled into programmes on education, social support and child welfare in the host city. That local focus is central to the Zayed Charity Run’s mission combining sport, culture and humanitarian aid.Participation in the Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is open to the public, with organizers encouraging people of all backgrounds to join from professional runners to families and first-time participants. The goal is to make the event accessible while ensuring that every registration contributes to a charitable cause.Runners can sign up online through the official Zayed Charity Run portal and affiliated sports websites.Every participant receives an official race T-shirt, bib number, timing chip, and finisher’s medal, along with access to hydration stations and first-aid support throughout the route.In keeping with its international editions, the Rio leg will also offer cash prizes for top finishers, alongside symbolic awards that honour participation and sportsmanship.Beyond the race itself, the Rio edition is designed as a community festival, complete with cultural showcases, live performances, and local food stalls. Families are encouraged to attend and cheer, turning the event into a day of joy and charity. The event organisers have emphasized that participation is open to all, with proceeds from registration fees and sponsorships directly funding local social welfare initiatives.","The Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is set to take place on Saturday, October 5, 2025. It is the first-ever edition in South America. The run will feature two main routes a 5km family-friendly course and a 10km competitive race. Proceeds from the race will support Rio-based welfare organisations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124321897,imgsize-1587779,width-400,resizemode-4/rio-2025.jpg"
Flydubai updates power bank rules from October 2025 following Emirates safety measures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/flydubai-updates-power-bank-rules-from-october-2025-following-emirates-safety-measures/articleshow/124319219.cms,"From October 1, 2025, Flydubai permits one 100Wh-or-less power bank in hand baggage only/Image: Flydubai

Flydubai’s power bank rules: Capacity, usage, and storage





Usage during flight is banned: Charging devices or the power bank itself using aircraft power sockets is not allowed at any time.

Storage location: Power banks must remain inside hand baggage, placed under the seat or in the seat pocket in front of the passenger. They are not allowed in overhead lockers.

Device status: The power bank must be switched off and secured to prevent accidental activation or short circuits.

Protective measures: It is recommended to keep power banks in their original packaging or a protective pouch for added safety.

Checked baggage: Power banks cannot be carried in checked luggage under any circumstances.



Lithium battery transport and related devices





Devices in checked baggage must be switched off and secured to prevent accidental activation during the flight.

Passengers uncertain about the compliance of their devices are advised to contact Flydubai before travelling for clarification.

Despite many aircraft offering in-seat charging, passengers should fully charge their devices before departure, especially on longer flights, as inflight charging is restricted for safety reasons.

Emirates’ influence on Flydubai’s policy





Allowing one power bank per passenger, limited to 100 Wh or less.

Prohibiting power bank use for charging personal devices or themselves via aircraft power sockets.

Mandating power banks be stored in seat pockets or under-seat bags, not overhead compartments.

Banning power banks in checked luggage altogether.





Starting October 1, 2025, Flydubai has implemented new, stricter guidelines for carrying power banks onboard flights, aligning with Emirates and UAE-wide safety standards. Passengers are allowed to carry only one power bank per person in hand baggage, subject to capacity limits and storage rules designed to reduce lithium battery-related risks during flights.Flydubai permits passengers to bring a single power bank in their carry-on luggage with a watt-hour (Wh) rating of 100 Wh or less. This capacity must be clearly indicated on the device itself, whether through labels, embossing, or printed information. Any power bank exceeding 100 Wh is strictly prohibited from all flights.Passengers must adhere to the following:Flydubai’s guidelines extend beyond power banks to all lithium-powered devices including laptops, mobile phones, e-cigarettes, rechargeable batteries, and digital cameras. Key points include:Flydubai’s new power bank restrictions follow Emirates’ announcement in August 2025, which took effect simultaneously on October 1. Emirates implemented similar measures after an increase in incidents linked to lithium battery-powered devices onboard. Their key restrictions include:Flydubai’s alignment with Emirates reflects broader UAE airline efforts to tighten inflight safety and prevent potential hazards related to portable electronic devices.","From October 1, 2025, Flydubai permits one 100Wh-or-less power bank in hand baggage only.

UAE: Sharjah police release hard-hitting video to curb phone use and distracted driving behind the wheel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sharjah-police-release-hard-hitting-video-to-curb-phone-use-and-distracted-driving-behind-the-wheel/articleshow/124318198.cms,"Sharjah Police’s new video warns drivers: seconds on your phone risk lives — 267 crashes linked to phone use this year./ AI Representative Image, for illustrative purposes only

Sharjah police awareness video: seconds of distraction cost lives

Local toll and legal consequences: 267 accidents and strict penalties

Sharjah road accidents and phone-related crashes analysis

Total reported road accidents in Sharjah (2025, Jan–Sep): ~1,950



Percentage linked to phone use: ~14%



Fatalities linked to phone use: 12 deaths reported



Common scenarios: texting while driving, scrolling social media, answering calls without hands-free devices



Nationwide push: coordinated campaigns and traffic-safety programs

What drivers must do — simple actions that save lives

Put the phone on Do Not Disturb and stow it before you start driving.



Use hands-free only if absolutely necessary — best practice is to stop safely before interacting.



Rely on passenger assistance for navigation or calls, or set directions before you move.



Report distracted drivers to authorities when safe to do so.







Sharjah Police have launched a hard-hitting awareness video warning drivers that even a few seconds of phone use behind the wheel can lead to tragic accidents, highlighting 267 crashes this year linked to distracted driving and urging everyone to “Don’t Be The Next Number. ”Sharjah Police released a new awareness video on October 4, 2025, showing how a few seconds spent replying, scrolling or taking a photo behind the wheel can lead to irreversible tragedy. The message is blunt: every statistic is a person’s life, and every “number” in the tally represents a preventable story. The short film closes with the campaign slogan, “Don’t be the next number,” urging drivers to put phones away while driving.Sharjah officials say 267 traffic accidents this year were linked specifically to mobile-phone use while driving — a figure Sharjah Police are using to underline the scale of the problem. Across the UAE, distracted driving penalties are steep: using a hand-held phone can incur an AED 800 fine and four black points under federal traffic law, with repeat or aggravated offences sometimes attracting vehicle impoundment.Authorities routinely use smart cameras and patrols to detect offenders. Sharjah Police have revealed that 267 traffic accidents in 2025 so far were directly linked to mobile phone use while driving. These accidents include collisions ranging from minor fender-benders to serious crashes causing injuries and fatalities.To put this into perspective:Authorities note that distracted driving has overtaken speeding as one of the leading causes of accidents in Sharjah. Patrols and smart traffic cameras are being used to detect offenders, while the awareness campaigns aim to reduce these numbers significantly.Experts say that even 3–5 seconds of distraction at typical city speeds can result in a collision, emphasizing that campaigns like “Don’t Be The Next Number” are crucial for behavioral change.The Sharjah campaign is part of a broader UAE drive against distracted driving. Federal and emirate police forces (including Dubai and Abu Dhabi) have released similar hard-hitting videos and data in recent months, and the Ministry of Interior’s road-safety events have explicitly focused on “driving without a phone.” Authorities combine public education, technological enforcement (smart cameras, AI monitoring) and legal penalties to cut incidents.These steps take seconds to set up and dramatically reduce crash risk; the goal of the campaign is behavior change, not blame.","Sharjah Police released a new awareness video on October 4, 2025, showing how a few seconds spent replying, scrolling or taking a photo behind the wheel can lead to tragedy. 267 traffic accidents in 2025 so far were directly linked to mobile phone use while driving.

As 2025 draws to a close, residents of the UAE have an extraordinary celestial lineup to look forward to. From the giant Harvest Moon lighting up October skies alongside Saturn and Jupiter, to three consecutive supermoons and multiple meteor showers illuminating the night, the coming months promise a stunning display of natural cosmic events visible without telescopes.On October 7, the first of three year-end supermoons—the Harvest Moon—will dazzle skywatchers across the UAE and worldwide. This full moon will coincide with the moon’s closest approach to Earth, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. The moon’s size seems especially impressive near the horizon, thanks to the “moon illusion,” where our eyes perceive it as bigger against familiar foreground objects like trees or buildings.The Harvest Moon, historically named for its role in aiding farmers to gather crops before winter, will rise just after sunset and remain visible in full form until October 9. Leading up to this, starting October 1, the waxing gibbous moon will draw closer to Saturn, creating a striking pairing in the southeastern evening sky. By October 5, observers will see the moon and Saturn rising side by side on the eastern horizon, just below the Summer Triangle formed by the stars Vega, Altair, and Deneb.Though Saturn’s actual diameter is 35 times larger than the moon’s, its immense distance—over a billion kilometers—makes it appear only as a small golden point near the bright lunar disc. Jupiter will also be visible nearby, adding to one of the year’s most remarkable and easily observable astronomical displays, best seen away from city lights under clear, dark skies.The Harvest Moon on October 7 marks the start of a unique sequence for the UAE: three consecutive supermoons occurring over three months. These include:Each supermoon will be visible across the UAE wherever there is a clear horizon, offering residents a unique and accessible opportunity to witness these lunar phenomena.The cosmic calendar doesn’t end with supermoons. UAE skies are also expected to light up with three major meteor showers, each offering unique viewing opportunities:All these meteor showers will be visible without special equipment, though stargazers are encouraged to seek dark-sky locations away from city lights for the best experience.To maximize enjoyment of these celestial events, residents are advised to:According to Khadijah Al Hariri, Operations Manager at Dubai Astronomy Group, these lunar and meteor events provide a unique chance for UAE residents to engage with the universe’s natural wonders without needing specialized equipment.","The Harvest Moon on October 7 marks the start of a unique sequence for the UAE: three consecutive supermoons occurring over three months.

The psychology behind fake job ads: Why victims fall for them

New age of scams: WhatsApp, Telegram, and AI-generated offers

The bigger picture: Why scammers target the UAE





In a recent advisory, Dubai Police have alerted the public about a significant increase in fraudulent advertisements circulating on social media platforms and various websites. These deceptive ads promise lucrative part-time job opportunities, preying on job seekers' aspirations.Authorities have issued a series of advisories across their official channels (including their X account and eCrime platform). Here’s their safety checklist:Public awareness is now the strongest shield — Dubai Police emphasize that every suspicious ad reported helps prevent another person from falling victim.Fraudsters exploit the allure of high-paying part-time jobs to lure individuals into illegal activities. These scams often involve:Such activities not only lead to financial loss but can also entangle victims in criminal offenses, making them liable under the law.Fraudulent part-time job ads don’t just target the desperate, they prey on ambition, curiosity, and convenience. Scammers know people are looking for side income, especially with promises like “work from home” or “earn AED 5,000 a week.”By dangling unusually high salaries with little effort required, fraudsters create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out. Victims often apply quickly, without verifying, because the deal seems too good to ignore.Dubai Police stress that such schemes are designed to trap ordinary people into illegal tasks, from opening bank accounts to transferring suspicious funds activities that could later be prosecuted as crimes.Unlike old-style email scams, these fraudulent job offers now spread through WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and even AI-generated recruiter profiles. Fake HR executives use stolen company logos, polished contracts, and professional-sounding chats to gain trust. Dubai Police have noted an alarming trend of AI tools being used to mimic real HR managers’ writing style making detection even harder.Fraudsters are increasingly targeting the UAE because of its large expatriate population, strong digital economy, and high job mobility. Many newcomers are eager to find quick part-time income, making them vulnerable to “golden opportunity” traps.But police also remind residents: every scam stopped keeps the country’s financial system safe from exploitation. “Fighting fraud is not just protecting one person — it protects the whole community.""","Dubai Police have issued a series of advisories across their official channels.

Looking ahead: What comes after EES?





Digitally linked to your passport



Valid for up to three years, or until the passport expires — whichever comes first



Required before boarding flights, trains, or ships bound for the Schengen Area









Starting 12 October 2025, travellers from the UAE heading to Europe will experience a major change at Schengen Area borders. The European Union ’s Entry/Exit System (EES) will go live, replacing the traditional manual passport stamping process with a digital border control system that uses biometric data. Designed to enhance security and streamline entry for non-EU visitors, the system applies to millions of third-country nationals, including those travelling from the UAE.Here’s a complete breakdown of what the EES is, who it affects, how it works, and what UAE residents need to prepare for before their next trip to Europe.The EES introduces automated border checks for non-EU nationals entering or exiting the Schengen Area for short stays. This includes UAE citizens and residents who are visa-exempt or travelling on a Schengen short-stay visa (up to 90 days in any 180-day period).From 12 October 2025, border control officers will digitally register the following data on arrival:This data is stored in a centralised EU database managed by eu-LISA, the European Agency for large-scale IT systems in the fields of freedom, security, and justice.On future trips, travellers won’t need to repeat the full biometric process.Instead, the system will verify identity using previously stored data and digitally log border crossings.Importantly, manual passport stamping will gradually be phased out, though some locations may continue to stamp passports during the system’s early rollout phase.The EES only applies to travellers from non-EU countries, meaning it directly affects UAE citizens and residents visiting the Schengen Area for short stays.Airlines operating in the UAE, including Emirates and Air Arabia, have already issued alerts to their passengers about the upcoming changes. Both carriers are advising travellers to allow extra time at border checks, especially during their first visit after the system goes live, as the new process could take longer than usual.The European Union is launching the EES to modernise its border management, increase security, and improve efficiency for both authorities and travellers. The current system — manually stamping passports — is time-consuming, often inaccurate, and unable to reliably detect overstayers.The EES aims to:The system also supports wider use of automated border control gates and self-service kiosks, making travel more seamless once initial biometric data is captured.This initiative is part of the EU’s broader Security Union agenda, supporting the goals of the European Agenda on Security and the European Agenda on Migration, particularly around countering terrorism and cross-border crime.The proposal for the EES was initially presented on 6 April 2016 under the Smart Borders Package. After negotiations, it was adopted on 20 November 2017, and came into force on 29 December 2017.The EES collects and stores several pieces of personal and biometric information:All data is stored securely and handled under strict EU data protection laws. Access is limited to:In certain circumstances, data may also be shared with international organisations or third countries under regulated conditions.Each travel record remains valid for three years from the last recorded crossing. If you cross the border again, the clock resets. Renewing your passport will not affect your stored data — the system will automatically match your new passport with your existing biometric records through facial recognition.There is no need to register in advance. Your biometric data will be collected on your first entry after the system goes live.Although the EES is intended to replace manual stamps, some countries or border points may still apply physical stamps temporarily during the transition period.There is no insurance requirement under the EES. However, some countries (e.g., France) may ask at kiosks whether travellers have medical coverage. Travel insurance is highly recommended but remains optional.Some EU countries may offer National Facilitation Programmes to speed up border checks for frequent visitors. Eligibility criteria and availability vary by member state.The EES applies across all external borders of the Schengen Area. Travellers from the UAE should expect the new system when visiting any of the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.While the Entry/Exit System (EES) is set to officially launch in October 2025, another significant change is scheduled to follow about a year later: the introduction of ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), often referred to informally as the “Euro visa.”ETIAS will be a new, mandatory pre-travel authorisation for visa-exempt nationals, including travellers from the UAE and the UK, who plan to travel to any of the 30 designated European countries in the Schengen Area. It is not technically a visa, but it is a compulsory security clearance designed to thoroughly screen travellers before they arrive.The authorisation is:If a traveller gets a new passport, they must apply for a new ETIAS authorisation, even if their previous one was still valid.Once implemented, ETIAS will work in tandem with the EES, further tightening EU border security by vetting travellers in advance and tracking their movements upon arrival and departure.For now, the focus remains on the smooth rollout of the EES, a foundational shift in how Europe manages border entry, aiming to balance security, efficiency, and traveller experience.","From October 2025, the EU’s EES system will replace manual passport stamping with biometric checks for all non-EU travellers, including UAE citizens. This includes UAE citizens and residents who are visa-exempt or travelling on a Schengen short-stay visa (up to 90 days in any 180-day period) The EES is designed to enhance security and streamline entry for non- EU visitors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124298009,imgsize-1160036,width-400,resizemode-4/eu-ees-system.jpg"
UAE: Dubai to roll out over 200 ultra-fast EV charging stations for taxis starting this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-dubai-to-roll-out-over-200-ultra-fast-ev-charging-stations-for-taxis-starting-thisyear/articleshow/124295417.cms,"Dubai launches 208 ultra-fast EV chargers for taxis and EVs, cutting costs, charging time, and boosting green mobility /AI Representative Image, for illustrative purposes only

How Dubai’s EV chargers will cut carbon emissions



Dubai taxi fleet electrification: Faster charging for drivers and riders

How this fits Dubai’s bigger EV plan





Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate - a move aimed at speeding up taxi fleet electrification and cutting transport emissions. The deal was signed at WETEX 2025 and is part of DEWA’s EV Green Charger program.The first phase will launch two main charging hubs: DTC’s depot near Dubai International Airport and DTC’s headquarters in Muhaisnah 4. The stations will include next-generation chargers with capacities up to 360 kW, designed to serve the growing electric taxi fleet and support fast turnaround times for vehicles. The rollout of 208 points will take place over the contract period and aligns with DTC’s broader fleet transformation plans.Dubai’s new ultra-fast EV charging stations will officially begin rolling out in late 2025, with the first two major hubs operational near Dubai International Airport (DTC depot) and Muhaisnah 4 (DTC headquarters). The full network of 208 charging points is expected to be gradually completed over the next 12–18 months, ensuring wider coverage for taxi fleets and public EV users.For drivers, the charging service is designed to be affordable and convenient.DEWA has confirmed that pricing will follow standard EV Green Charger tariffs, with potential special rates for fleet operators like Dubai Taxi Company to support the transition to electric vehicles. Drivers can pay using DEWA’s mobile app, smart cards, or contactless payment methods at each station, making the process seamless Access is straightforward: taxi operators and individual EV owners can register through the DEWA EV Green Charger portal or app, select the nearest available charger, and start charging immediately once registered. The ultra-fast chargers, with capacities up to 360 kW, can significantly reduce charging times, allowing taxis to return to service in under 30 minutes at high-power stations.This rollout ensures that drivers face minimal downtime, can plan routes efficiently around charging points, and benefit from a growing, reliable EV infrastructure. With careful planning, fleet operators can optimize schedules and reduce operational costs while contributing to Dubai’s green mobility and carbon reduction goals.DEWA and DTC estimate the initial phase will reduce about 37,939 metric tonnes of CO₂ annually; when combined with DTC’s existing chargers, annual savings could reach around 49,654 tonnes. This contribution supports Dubai’s Green Mobility Strategy 2030 and the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 goals. The project is explicitly framed as a climate-action step as much as an infrastructure upgrade.DTC aims to electrify its entire fleet of taxis and limousines by 2040, with the EV fleet expected to surpass 2,500 vehicles by 2030. Ultra-fast chargers (up to 360 kW) will shorten charging windows and improve operational efficiency for drivers, helping taxis return to service faster. This contract complements other private-sector rollouts in Dubai designed to cut charge times to “under 30 minutes” at many ultra-fast sites. Together, these moves make daily EV operations more practical for commercial fleets and drivers.DEWA’s EV Green Charger initiative, launched in 2014, already supports 1,500+ charging points across Dubai; the new DTC agreement adds capacity targeted at fleet needs while strengthening the public charging ecosystem. Other recent projects (private and public) aim to install hundreds more ultra-fast points across high-traffic locations, retail hubs, residential clusters and transport nodes over the next 12–24 months. This layered approach (fleet hubs + public ultra-fast sites) is intended to reduce range anxiety and accelerate EV adoption citywide.DEWA–DTC deal is a practical step to electrify Dubai’s transport layer: it pairs high-power chargers with clear fleet targets and measurable carbon savings. For drivers, fleet operators and residents this means cleaner rides, shorter charging waits and a faster path to a greener city.","Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate.

Awareness through the ‘Your Comment’ initiative





Abu Dhabi Police have released footage of a serious traffic accident caused by a vehicle stopping without justification in the middle of a busy road, a reckless act that triggered a chain of crashes involving other inattentive drivers. The video, broadcast in coordination with the Command and Control Center, forms part of the police’s ongoing efforts to raise awareness about dangerous road behavior.The footage, which shows several cars colliding after one vehicle came to a sudden stop, highlights the grave consequences of not paying full attention while driving. According to the Directorate of Traffic and Security Patrols, many of the vehicles involved were driven by individuals distracted by things other than the road, unable to react in time to the unexpected hazard.Authorities clarified that stopping in the middle of the road is strictly prohibited, regardless of the reason — whether due to a tire malfunction, mechanical failure, or otherwise. Drivers are required to exit the roadway safely and head toward the nearest shoulder or designated stopping point to avoid obstructing traffic and endangering lives.If the vehicle cannot be moved, motorists must immediately call 999 to contact the Operations Room, enabling police to deploy support and minimize the risk of further accidents or traffic congestion.Additionally, other road users who encounter vehicles stopped improperly should turn on hazard lights, maintain a safe distance, and stay fully alert to avoid collisions. Police emphasized that even a momentary distraction can have catastrophic consequences, particularly in high-speed zones.The warning comes alongside a reminder about the legal consequences of irresponsible road behavior:Stopping randomly in the middle of the road without valid justification:Obstructing traffic flow:Using a mobile phone or being distracted while driving:Running a red light (motorcyclists and motorists):These penalties reflect the UAE’s strict commitment to road safety and are designed to prevent accidents that often result in severe injuries or loss of life.The crash footage forms part of Abu Dhabi Police’s “Your Comment” initiative, a public safety campaign where real accident clips are posted on social media to highlight the dangers of specific violations. This initiative encourages public discussion around safe driving practices, with each video serving as a real-world example of how reckless behavior can lead to devastating outcomes.Authorities reiterated their message: Stay focused, never stop in active lanes, and call 999 for help when needed. Community members are also encouraged to report illegal or unsafe road behavior using any of the police’s official communication channels.","Abu Dhabi Police have released footage of a serious traffic accident caused by a vehicle stopping without justification in the middle of a busy road.

Direct Dubai-Abu Dhabi bus route linking Al Quoz and MBZ City





Expanding Dubai-Abu Dhabi bus network for improved accessibility



Part of a bigger shift toward seamless mobility





In a move to improve intercity connectivity and expand public transport options, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has launched a new direct, non-stop bus service between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Operating in partnership with Capital Express — a major transport provider in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain — this express service is designed to serve residents in areas of Dubai not previously covered by existing routes to the capital.The new express bus connects Al Quoz Bus Station in Dubai with MBZ City Bus Station in Abu Dhabi, operating non-stop along Sheikh Zayed Road, the main highway linking the two emirates. With no scheduled stops in between, the estimated journey time ranges from 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on real-time traffic conditions. This is slightly faster than traditional intercity buses, which typically take 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes, especially when serving multiple stops along the route.Each journey is priced at Dh25 ($6.80) per person, with payments accepted via cash, contactless bank cards, or nol cards — the latter being the city's unified fare payment system. The service runs seven days a week, with buses departing every three hours.Each bus accommodates up to 50 passengers and features bright green livery for easy identification.While the RTA have yet to disclose the specific route number or publish a full timetable, the frequency and non-stop nature mark this as a distinct addition to the intercity network.Until now, intercity buses between Dubai and Abu Dhabi primarily departed from Al Ghubaiba Bus Station (serving Bur Dubai) and Ibn Battuta Bus Station, which caters to commuters from areas like Jebel Ali, JLT, Dubai Marina, and The Palm. The addition of the Al Quoz route offers a new departure point for residents in Umm Suqeim, Al Barsha, and nearby neighborhoods, significantly improving accessibility.This development is part of the RTA’s broader public transport strategy, which focuses on enhancing connectivity, intermodal integration, and commuter convenience. The authority aims to make public transport a first-choice option by linking buses with other transit modes such as the Dubai Metro, tram, and marine transport.The launch follows similar intercity transport expansions, including a Dubai-Sharjah service introduced in May 2025. That service, known as Route 308, connects Stadium Bus Station in Dubai to Al Jubail Bus Station in Sharjah at a fare of Dh12 per trip. The RTA also recently introduced five new bus routes across Dubai and modified several existing routes to meet growing demand and improve commuting efficiency.According to Adel Shakeri, Director of Planning and Business Development at RTA’s Public Transport Agency, improving intermodal transport options is vital to encouraging the use of public transit. The goal, he stated, is to offer smoother and more efficient journeys by connecting various transportation modes and routes across the city and beyond.Currently, the RTA operates a modern fleet of over 250 intercity buses, all of which are equipped with free high-speed Wi-Fi, allowing passengers to stay connected, whether for work or leisure, during their daily commute.Looking ahead, more exciting developments are on the horizon. The long-awaited Etihad Rail passenger service is scheduled to launch in 2026, offering high-speed train travel between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in under an hour. Beyond speed and comfort, Etihad Rail plans to integrate seamlessly with existing metro routes and feeder bus services, enhancing last-mile connectivity and ensuring consistently smooth transfers between the rail network and the cities’ broader public transport systems. While buses remain the most widely budget-friendly transport option between the emirates for now, rail is set to introduce a transformative new dimension of convenience and daily efficiency for modern urban commuters.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has launched a new direct, non-stop bus service between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:





Driven by a youthful population and a mobile-first approach, India is getting sucked big-time into digital junk on social media platforms even as western nations are showing signs of plateauing and even declining in this aspect.A recent analysis by the digital audience insights company GWI reveals that daily time spent on social platforms by adults in developed countries has been on a downward trend since a peak in 2022 even as it is rising in India. By the end of 2024, usage in the west was down by nearly 10% from its high point, the decline most pronounced in Europe, although the jury is still out on the effect of AI, which is now throwing up new content.However, India's story is one of rapid and ongoing growth. With a median age of just 28.8, India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion. The country's users spend an average of 2 hours and 28 minutes per day on social media, notably higher than the U.S. average of 2 hours and 9 minutes per day, and far higher than Europe’s 1 hour 48 minutes.The divergence in usage trends is also reflected in platform preferences and content consumption.In India, platforms that facilitate a mobile-first, video-heavy, and community-driven experience are the most popular. WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram are major players, with short-form video content like Reels and Shorts dominating engagement.The data suggests that for many in the West, the initial novelty and high engagement of social media are fading. Binge is now cringe. This downward trend is seen most among heaviest historical users: teenagers and people in their twenties.While platforms like TikTok – which is banned in India – are popular in the U.S., the overall consumption patterns are different, with some reports indicating a shift away from reflexive, time-filling scrolling toward more intentional online activities. In other words, westerners are turning up their nose and nos, while Indians are plunging headlong into brain rot, sucking in social media slop just as they are with junk food and sugary drinks, while social media giants are picking their pockets.In a recent essay, the technology writer Cory Doctorow identified a three-stage life cycle for these platforms in a process he called ""enshittification,"" – a predictable pattern of decay as they evolve to prioritize shareholder profit over user value.Stage 1: They are good to their users (Bait). The platform offers a genuinely good service—often at a loss—to attract a massive, locked-in user base. Stage 2: (Switch). Once users are locked in (due to network effects or switching costs), the platform begins shifting the ""surplus"" value away from them and toward its business customers (suppliers, creators, advertisers). Stage 3: (Extraction). Finally, with both users and business customers fully dependent, the platform exploits the business customers, clawing back all remaining value to maximize profit for its shareholders. The platform becomes a ""useless pile of shit,"" filled with ""botshit, crap gadgets,"" and advertising scams.There is now a growing movement towards digital detoxification in the west even as the situation is aggravated by AI – illustrated by the America’s troller-in-chief himself dispensing AI-generated garbage, adding to the copious output of social media sewage. Grassroots Advocacy organizations like the youth-led ""LOG OFF Movement"" are urging people to reject what is being called the “attention economy” amid a push to regulate social media companies, despite the major ones having burrowed their way into Washington DC and now allied with the ruling dispensation.","India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion.

Function-first design: robots that actually work

AI will transform businesses and education





Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has praised Elon Musk for being “smart and ahead of the curve,” particularly in the realm of video-trained robotics and AI. However, Cuban remains sceptical about Musk’s vision of humanoid robots dominating the future. Speaking on the Prof G Markets podcast, Cuban highlighted that while robotics will be crucial for productivity, the future lies in function-first, task-oriented robots rather than human-like machines. He envisions robots capable of performing practical chores efficiently, such as cleaning, sorting laundry, or dusting, without necessarily looking like humans. Musk, on the other hand, predicts humanoid robots could one day be as ubiquitous as smartphones, potentially transforming the global economy.Elon Musk sees humanoid robots, such as Tesla’s Optimus, becoming as common as smartphones. He envisions these machines creating an economy “ten times the size of the current global economy” and bringing about “universal high income.” Musk even joked at a Saudi forum that one Optimus robot performed the “Trump dance,” highlighting the cultural and technological novelty he anticipates.Cuban emphasised that video-trained AI robotics are a key advantage Musk has in the field.“With robotics, they've got to capture video. That's where Elon is smart and ahead of the curve,” Cuban said. But he doubts humanoid robots will be the main game-changer, arguing that practical design and function will matter more than human-like appearances.Cuban envisions robots designed to complete tasks autonomously, like cleaning homes or sorting laundry. These machines could resemble spiders or other efficient shapes rather than humans. “It’s going to know what socks go together, how long to wash, and even check under the bed for dust,” he explained. The focus is on efficiency and usability, not mimicry.Despite differences on humanoid adoption, both Cuban and Musk agree on AI’s transformative power. Cuban highlighted his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, where AI-powered robotics manufactures medicines faster and cheaper than in India or China. He also stressed AI’s potential to help small businesses improve efficiency and provide young people with unprecedented learning opportunities. “There's nothing a child can't learn right now,” Cuban said.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has praised Elon Musk for being ‘smart and ahead of the curve,’ particularly in the realm of video-trained robotics and AI.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

We miss you, my friend.” For those unaware, Jobs died on October 5, 2011 after 8 eight years of battling pancreatic cancer. Tim Cook’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who reposted it on his timeline.Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak. During his leadership, Apple launched groundbreaking products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, reshaping entire industries and redefining the way people communicate, work, and consume entertainment.Renowned for his focus on design and user experience, Jobs was instrumental in making technology simpler and more accessible. His vision not only revived Apple from the brink of collapse but also propelled it into becoming one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.When Steve Jobs was battling severe health issues in the late 2000s, Apple’s then–Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook made a deeply personal gesture.Cook offered to donate a part of his liver to Jobs, since both shared the same rare blood type.According to accounts later revealed in Cook’s biography and media reports, the Apple executive underwent extensive medical testing and found that he was indeed a suitable donor. However, Jobs firmly declined the offer.Cook recalled that Jobs became emotional but quickly dismissed the idea, telling him: “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.” Jobs, who was known for his uncompromising principles and independent spirit, made it clear he would not accept such a sacrifice from a colleague and friend.This episode highlighted both Cook’s deep loyalty to Jobs and the unique bond the two shared during Apple’s most transformative years. While Jobs continued to struggle with his health, he refused to let anyone else bear the risks of a major procedure on his behalf.Jobs eventually underwent a liver transplant in 2009, performed by a medical team in Tennessee, but not with Cook as a donor. He returned to lead Apple after the surgery, but his health continued to decline until his passing in October 2011.","Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary.
