From viral sideline sweetheart to polarizing figure on Bears turf

Fan resentment grows as feud with Riley Gaines resurfaces

From America's sweetheart to NFL target

Once celebrated as the NFL ’s “it couple,” Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens are now facing unexpected backlash. From viral sideline moments to social media criticism, fans have turned on Biles amid controversy. Her public feud with Riley Gaines may be fueling the fallout as her NFL support takes a surprising hit.Not long ago, Simone Biles was hailed as the gold standard of NFL WAGs (wives and girlfriends), captivating fans with her heartfelt sideline moments alongside husband Jonathan Owens, now a Chicago Bears safety. In December 2024, she was praised for her warm embrace and playful handshake with Owens before a Bears game, a viral moment that had fans dubbing them the “real MVP couple,” even above the media-favorite Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.But fast forward to the Bears' Family Fest on August 3, 2025, and the narrative around Biles has taken a sharp turn. Although the couple shared another affectionate pregame interaction, the public reaction was jarringly different. Fans who once celebrated Biles turned hostile, criticizing everything from her fashion choices to her very presence. One commenter asked, “She hasn’t been fully canceled yet?” while another bluntly called her “overrated as a human being.The sudden shift in public sentiment may trace back to Biles’ public clash with Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer and outspoken conservative voice on women's sports. The feud, which played out on social media and cable networks, polarized audiences and cast Biles in a political spotlight she hadn’t occupied before. Now, some NFL fans appear to be taking sides—against her.While there’s no concrete evidence that her dispute with Gaines triggered the backlash at Family Fest, it seems to have intensified the public’s scrutiny. Critics even mocked her for not wearing Bears gear, suggesting she was stealing the spotlight. “She’s not even a real fan,” one user joked, pointing out her neutral outfit.Simone Biles may be used to pressure from years of elite competition, but this type of fan revolt marks new territory. The internet has turned on the Olympic icon with alarming speed—transforming her from NFL darling to divisive figure. As one social media user harshly put it, “She used to represent strength. Now she just wants attention.”Also Read: “Ivanka is prettier than Gisele”: Donald Trump mocked Tom Brady and made eyebrow-raising comments about Gisele Bündchen For Biles, the next few months could be a defining chapter—not in gymnastics, but in navigating a more unforgiving side of NFL fandom.","Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens were once hailed as NFL's ""it couple"" Biles' public feud with Riley Gaines may be fueling the fallout as her NFL support takes a surprising hit.

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts. This helps free up system resources for actual money transfers.Yes, they are part of NPCI’s long-term strategy to manage growing UPI traffic and improve user safety.","India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warns ChatGPT users’ personal questions could be used in lawsuits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/think-before-you-ask-why-chatgpt-legal-queries-can-be-used-against-you-as-court-evidence/articleshow/123034984.cms,"Your ChatGPT conversations are not legally confidential



AI-Generated legal advice isn’t actually legal advice



Deleted chats with AI aren’t safe from legal scrutiny



Why it’s best to speak with a human lawyer instead of ChatGPT



Also Read:





ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways. Many users aren’t aware that anything they type into the chatbot, even deleted messages, can be retained and used as evidence in legal proceedings. Because the platform feels private and conversational, people may overshare without realising the potential consequences. Unlike lawyers, AI tools are not bound by confidentiality or ethical obligations. This means that sharing sensitive legal concerns with a chatbot doesn't just offer unreliable advice; it may also create a discoverable digital trail, potentially compromising privacy, increasing legal exposure, and causing unintended consequences. Before you confide in AI, it is important to understand these risks and why human legal counsel is still essential for safe, accurate guidance.In a recent appearance on the This Past Weekend podcast hosted by comedian Theo Von, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a candid admission: conversations with ChatGPT are not protected under any kind of legal privilege. ""Right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor, there’s legal privilege for it,"" Altman explained.""There’s doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s legal confidentiality. And we haven’t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT. "" This means if you type out a sensitive legal scenario, say, describing an incident that might amount to a crime or seeking strategic legal advice, that chat can potentially be disclosed in court. According to Altman, OpenAI could be legally compelled to hand over your conversations, even if they’ve been deleted.The consequences of this are serious. Legal experts like Jessee Bundy from Creative Counsel have warned users not to mistake AI for actual legal representation. ""If you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking [the chatbot] for strategy, you're not getting legal advice,"" Jessee E. Bundy posted on X (formerly Twitter). ""You’re generating discoverable evidence. No attorney-client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you."" She added that ChatGPT may feel private and helpful, but unlike a licensed attorney, it has no legal obligation to act in your best interest, and it can’t be held accountable for any incorrect advice it generates.When Malte Landwehr, CEO of an AI company, suggested that ChatGPT could still provide useful legal input even if it’s not confidential, Bundy strongly pushed back.“ChatGPT can’t give you legal advice,” she replied. “Legal advice comes from a licensed professional who understands your specific facts, goals, risks, and jurisdiction. And is accountable for it. ChatGPT is a language model. It generates words that sound right based on patterns, but it doesn’t know your situation, and it’s not responsible if it’s wrong.” Calling it “legal Mad Libs,” Bundy stressed that relying on ChatGPT for legal issues is both risky and potentially self-incriminating.User conversations with AI chatbots, including those that have been deleted, may still be stored and subject to disclosure in legal proceedings. As highlighted by ongoing litigation, some companies are required to retain chat records, which could be subpoenaed in court. This includes potentially sensitive or personal exchanges.At present, there is no legal obligation for AI platforms to treat user chats as confidential in the same way communications with a lawyer or therapist are protected. Until laws are updated to account for AI interactions, users should be aware that anything typed into a chatbot could, in some cases, be used as evidence.For legal concerns, whether it’s about a contract, criminal matter, or a rights dispute, it’s essential to consult a licensed professional. Unlike AI, lawyers are bound by strict confidentiality, legal privilege, and ethical duties. AI-generated responses may feel private and helpful, but they are not protected, verified, or accountable. While it may be tempting to turn to AI for convenience, doing so for legal issues could expose you to unnecessary risk.As artificial intelligence becomes more common in everyday use, it’s important to recognise its limitations, especially in areas involving legal or personal stakes. Conversations with AI are not protected under legal privilege, and in the eyes of the law, they can be accessed like any other form of communication. Until privacy and legal frameworks are in place for AI, it’s safest to avoid using chatbots for legal questions. For advice you can trust and that will remain confidential, always consult a qualified legal professional.","ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways.

Mark Zuckerberg’s offer and Tulloch’s viral rejection





Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta. A former OpenAI engineer, Tulloch is now the co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab alongside ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. The AI startup, still in its early stages, is already valued at $12 billion. Tulloch’s decision to decline Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment attempt reflects a broader trend of top AI talent prioritizing independence, mission-driven work, and long-term impact over staggering financial packages.Tulloch’s journey began at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with first-class honours and a University Medal in mathematics. He later earned a Master’s in Mathematical Statistics from Cambridge and pursued a PhD at UC Berkeley. Tulloch worked at Meta (then Facebook) from 2012 to 2023, contributing to machine learning systems and the development of PyTorch. He joined OpenAI in 2023, focusing on GPT-4 pretraining and reasoning models, before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab in early 2025.Co-founded with Mira Murati, Thinking Machines Lab is focused on building AI systems that are safer, interpretable, and customizable—going beyond traditional chatbot interfaces.The startup, though yet to release a product, has secured a $2 billion seed round with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, AMD, and Google Cloud. Its ambition and leadership have made it a top target for recruitment, especially from Zuckerberg's new ""superintelligence"" division at Meta.According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg personally tried to lure Tulloch back to Meta with a six-year offer worth up to $1.5 billion, contingent on bonuses and stock performance. Tulloch declined, joining other Thinking Machines Lab co-founders in resisting Meta’s poaching attempts. The bold rejection has gone viral, with Tulloch’s LinkedIn profile celebrated for charting a rare career driven by principles rather than payouts. Meta later disputed the exact terms of the offer but confirmed outreach efforts were made.","Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta.

'Great Jeans' or 'White Supremacy'? Sydney Sweeney's Ad Sparks Political Backlash





""Euphoria"" star Sydney Sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.A short video of 27-year-old actress Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral, with social media users impressed by her sharp aim and quick shooting.In the clip, Sydney can be seen dressed casually with earmuffs on. She is seen confidently loading and firing a Glock.Her steady stance and tight shot groupings had many online saying she looked like a pro, not a first-timer. Netizens reacted quickly as the video of Sydney Sweeney at a shooting range circulated online.One user reposted the video and wrote, ""Sydney Sweeney has insane handgun skills.""While another user reposted saying, ""She doesn’t just have great jeans; she's also a total pro at the firing range, unloading 17 rounds in just 9 seconds,"" referring to her recent American Eagle campaign.The video’s buzz comes in the midst of online backlash over Sweeney’s American Eagle ad, which has been criticised for its messaging and portrayal.The ad, which features Sweeney in a classic Americana setting fixing a car and wearing denim. Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.",A short video of Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral.

China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

deliver high-power, rapid charging, often bringing EV batteries from 20% to 80% in under 30 minutes. This infrastructure supports Qatar National Vision 2030 by promoting clean transport, reducing emissions, and enhancing convenience through digital tools.









What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.





DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.





Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.





Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.





Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.









Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement





Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.





Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).





The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.









Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.





Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.





Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.













On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals.During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements.Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.Charging speeds are categorized as:These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.Qatar’s surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint. These high-speed DC chargers offer rapid refueling, increased convenience, and drive cleaner mobility choices. Supported by smart apps, infrastructure engagement, and expansion plans, Qatar is accelerating into a greener transport future.","Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative.

Putin Widens Effort to Control Russia's Internet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/putin-widens-effort-to-control-russias-internet/articleshow/123084317.cms,".

Vanishing Freedoms

The Russian WeChat





Russia is escalating its efforts to curtail online freedom, taking new steps toward a draconian state-controlled internet.Authorities are cracking down on workarounds that Russians have been using for access to foreign apps and banned content, including through new laws signed by President Vladimir Putin last week. Moscow has also been impeding the function of services from U.S. tech companies, like YouTube, that Russians have used for years.At the same time, the Kremlin is building out a domestic ecosystem of easily monitored and censored Russian alternatives to Western tech products. That includes a new state-approved messaging service, MAX, which will come preinstalled by law on all new smartphones sold in Russia starting next month.The idea, experts say, is to migrate more Russians from an open internet dominated by the products of Western tech giants to a censored online ecosystem, where Russians primarily use software under the gaze and influence of the state. The effort has advanced significantly amid wartime repression, but it is unclear how far it will go.""The goal here is absolute control,"" said Anastasiia Kruope, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who wrote a recent report on declining Russian internet freedoms.The Kremlin wants to control not only the information available online but also where and how internet traffic flows, Kruope said, so the Russian internet can function in isolation and be switched on and off at will. Russia's technical capabilities for clamping down are improving, she added.""They are not perfect,"" Kruope said. ""They are not nearly at the level they would like them to be. But they are getting better, and this is the reason to start paying attention.""Unlike China, where users have been restricted since the dawn of the internet, Russia long boasted one of the most open and freewheeling environments anywhere online. Operating with virtually no barriers, millions of Russians flocked to Western tech platforms, posted critical news and freely expressed their thoughts on the web.The Kremlin began to see that freedom as a threat, particularly after the rise of opposition activist Alexei Navalny, who died in prison last year. His exposes of the Putin elite, initially publicized in Live Journal blog posts and later in popular YouTube videos, gave him millions of followers online and the power to mobilize mass protests on the street.Since the first decade of Putin's rule, Moscow had been articulating a vision for what it called a ""sovereign"" internet that would sever Russia as much as possible from the rest of the online world and strip power from foreign tech companies, which didn't always give in to the Kremlin's demands.But Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 gave the government the opportunity to accelerate the plan.On the eve of the invasion, the state indirectly took over VK, the country's biggest social network, harnessing a platform with millions of existing users to popularize Russian alternatives to Western tech products. The son of Putin's powerful first deputy chief of staff, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, was tapped to run the company.Moscow banned Facebook, Instagram and Twitter outright and took steps that caused TikTok to disable functions in Russia. Lawmakers passed draconian laws stifling free expression in the streets and online. Last year, after creating a video-streaming service on VK, Russia began throttling YouTube, pushing users toward the domestic alternative, though with mixed success.Now, with the introduction of MAX, authorities have signaled they may take aim at foreign messaging apps, in particular WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta and counts nearly 100 million monthly users in Russia. Telegram could be a target as well.Anton V. Gorelkin, deputy head of the information technology committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, said last month that WhatsApp should ""prepare to leave the Russian market."" He said Russians would replace the app with MAX.At an economic forum in June, Gorelkin also called Telegram, based in the United Arab Emirates and owned by Russian-born internet entrepreneur Pavel Durov, ""an entity that worries the state."" But he said previously that the app would not be banned.""I am very afraid that other methods of communication are going to be blocked,"" said Mikhail Klimarev, head of the Internet Protection Society, an exiled Russian digital-rights group.Beyond messaging, Telegram allows Russians access to content from exiled journalists, activists and artists, who post in channels. At the same time, the Kremlin uses Telegram to distribute its propaganda, giving the app a chance of survival. Klimarev said a Telegram blockage would devastate the Russian internet.""Russia will turn into Mordor,"" he said, referring to the dark realm ruled by evil in the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien.Through MAX, Russian officials are hoping to create their own version of China's WeChat, an app that remains indispensable for millions of Chinese despite being both censored and monitored.Apart from messaging and uploading posts, WeChat users can pay utility bills, book train tickets, make payments for goods and services, apply for marriage licenses and in some places even file for divorce.Moscow is following that model. A new law says government services must be offered through MAX. Officials across all levels of Russian government are being told to install the app. Already, local authorities have been testing the use of MAX by schools and signaling that teachers will be required to use it to communicate with students and parents.""You need to bring it into the daily life of people to the extent that you cannot avoid this app anymore,"" said Philipp Dietrich, an analyst at the German Council on Foreign Relations.""The whole point of doing this is the same reason China is doing WeChat: the more information you can gather against your citizens, the better,"" Dietrich added.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)MAX's future in part will boil down to how well it functions. Already, Russian internet users have parodied its rollout with memes. A well-known Russian singer and influencer was ridiculed for touting the app to her 5.3 million followers on Instagram -- which is itself banned -- and boasting about its ability to get service ""even in the parking garage.""Klimarev noted that Russia had tried to push its own messaging apps before and failed. He also expressed skepticism that Russians, who are aware of government surveillance, will start speaking, messaging or posting freely on MAX.If WhatsApp and Telegram are blocked, Klimarev said, Russians may still gain access to them using virtual private networks, or VPNs, services that reroute internet traffic to circumvent restrictions. Many Russians still use YouTube, Instagram and Facebook through VPNs, though the blockage has significantly dented Russian traffic to the services.Although VPNs are not explicitly illegal, Moscow is expanding an effort to block them and prevent their usage by everyday Russians. As of late last year, Russian authorities had blocked nearly 200 VPNs, Human Rights Watch said, in what has become a regular cat-and-mouse game between authorities and nimble providers.Authorities have also pressured foreign companies like Apple to remove VPN software from app stores. And they have begun exploring new ways to identify and block VPN traffic deeper in the internet's infrastructure, according to Human Rights Watch.Putin signed a new law Thursday that bans the advertisement of VPN services, making it harder for Russians to find out about new ones as old ones are blocked. New rules also make using a VPN to commit a crime an ""aggravating circumstance"" that will increase fines and prison sentences.The Russian leader signed another broad law Thursday that criminalizes the act of searching for ""extremist"" content. Videos from Navalny's anti-corruption group, for example, are labeled ""extremist"" in Russia.Even without banning Telegram, Russia has found ways to limit critical content on the platform. Igor Girkin, an ultranationalist who developed a following on Telegram and criticized the Russian military, was sentenced to four years in prison on extremism charges, chilling other criticism from extreme pro-war military bloggers.In recent days, authorities arrested the head of the tabloid-style Telegram channel Baza, known for publishing videos of Russian law-enforcement raids, and accused him of paying off Russian officials for exclusive information. He denied the charges.Russian authorities once sought to pressure foreign tech giants into obeying Kremlin demands with threats, fines and other penalties, said Andrey Zakharov, the author of a new book about the Russian internet. But the approach has changed with the war.""Now the tactic is to block them, kill them and provide an alternative,"" Zakharov said, noting also that corruption and incompetence often undermined the follow-through. ""MAX is a continuation of that story.""This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","Russia is cracking down on workarounds for access to foreign apps and banned content.

Yasmina is a bilingual AI assistant fluent in both Khaleeji Arabic and English, developed by Yango Group specifically for users in Oman and the broader GCC region. Integrated into Yasmina smart speakers (Midi, Mini, and Lite) and the Yango Play app, Yasmina is designed to deliver culturally resonant, highly personal voice interactions. Her advanced conversational skills stem from YangoAI’s upgraded large language model (LLM), tailored for authenticity in regional dialects and context.Trained with diverse regional voices and linguistics experts, Yasmina goes beyond conventional assistants, she offers empathy, humour, and human-like dialogue rooted in Khaleeji culture.Yango Group introduced Yasmina in alignment with Oman Vision 2040, aiming to enhance digital literacy, local innovation, and access to technology across households, schools, and communities. ITHCA Group, the investment arm of Oman’s sovereign fund, praised Yasmina as a tool that introduces AI in practical, user-friendly formats—helpful to families, students, and digital novices alike.As per Gulf Business, Islam Abdul Karim, Head of Yango Middle East, described Yasmina as part of a broader mission to deliver technology shaped for everyday life. He emphasised that Yasmina promotes AI access and aligns strategically with Oman’s drive toward technological independence and digital transformation.Yasmina is powered by YangoAI’s proprietary LLM, engineered to support high-quality responses across Arabic and English. The model processes information with up to 38% greater relevance in Arabic and significantly fewer refusals than earlier versions, delivering richer, context-aware conversations.Extensive training data included diverse Arabic dialects and speech patterns collected from cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, ensuring Yasmina understands variations in pronunciation, slang, and stylistic nuances.Hundreds of regional dialect experts and content contributors took part in Yasmina’s development, including naming the assistant through public feedback. This crowdsourced approach improved linguistic authenticity and regional relevance.Speakers are retail-ready in Oman and UAE, sold at outlets including Virgin Megastore, Sharaf DG, and via platforms like noon.com (priced at approximately AED 279–449 in the UAE).The full suite of Yasmina’s features (including entertainment, smart home integration, local services, and AI responses) requires an active subscription to Yango Play, Yango Group’s multi-functional entertainment platform, available across GCC.Families ask Yasmina to set prayer reminders, play Surahs, plan local outings, cook traditional meals, or calm children with bedtime stories. Smart home commands (like controlling lighting or music) are also supported.In schools or homes, Yasmina simplifies classroom topics, helps learners grasp Arabic or English, and fosters interactive thinking through questions and games.For individuals, tasks like translation, travel planning, creativity prompts, financial explanations, and emotional support are all easily initiated via Yasmina’s conversational interface.Achieving emotional resonance and culturally sensitive dialogue depends heavily on continuous LLM refinement and linguistic updates. Early local beta feedback has been positive, but scaling quality remains a priority.As a voice assistant, Yasmina must ensure data privacy and opt-in user control, capabilities included in the speaker hardware and app interfaces.Yango Group plans to add more local dialect support, content features, and app integrations. Yasmina is positioned to evolve into a central voice interface across GCC smart ecosystems, including banking, education, and public services.Yasmina is more than a voice assistant, she represents a shift in AI design philosophy: technology built around cultural relevance and everyday practicality. By blending advanced AI with local dialect understanding and regional content, Yasmina empowers users to interact naturally and meaningfully. From classrooms to living rooms, Yasmina’s presence in Oman heralds a new era where AI isn’t just smart, it’s personally relevant.","Yasmina is a bilingual AI assistant fluent in both Khaleeji Arabic and English, developed by Yango Group.

These portable devices strengthen road safety efforts by allowing enforcement flexibility in high-risk areas.These Rasid mobile cameras are easy to deploy at unpredictable locations, offering a tactical advantage over fixed systems. As a result, violation rates dropped significantly even before tougher penalties took effect on April 22, 2025. According to major-general Yousef Al‑Khaddah, speeding violations fell by 43%, while red-light offences dropped 55% in early 2025 compared to Q1 2024.The new traffic law also introduced harsher fines, jail sentences, and tougher enforcement for reckless behaviours.After April 22, Kuwait’s Decree-Law No. 5/2025 introduced stronger penalties for traffic violations, including:Automated cameras showed violations plunged by 95% in April, and monthly offences registered just 28,464 in May 2025, down sharply from 168,208 in May 2024 as per WHO.

The price problem: Vegas isn't cheap — but can it still be worth it?





Las Vegas is no longer the unstoppable tourism titan it once was, with visitor numbers plunging and online chatter echoing a grim reality — empty casinos, rising costs, and a hospitality industry struggling to keep up appearances.According to the latest figures from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), only 3.1 million tourists visited Las Vegas in June, a sharp 11.3% drop from the same time last year. Hotel occupancy rates slipped 6.5%, while average daily room rates fell 6.6%, landing at $163.64. Even Harry Reid International Airport is feeling the slowdown, with a 4.1% year-to-date drop in traffic, according to a news report from Fox News.According to Fox News, Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg didn't sugarcoat it during a recent earnings call, calling this season a ""soft summer"" to local reports.The story isn't just in the stats. Social media platforms like X and Reddit are flooded with firsthand reports painting a bleak picture. One user claimed, ""Casinos are empty … people are being laid off … there is no tourism."" Another shared a photo of a deserted gaming floor with the caption: ""Las Vegas is dead, bro.""Reddit's r/lasvegas thread is buzzing with similar concerns. One user blamed aggressive pricing tactics:""While the economy is going downhill, the Strip nickel and diming folks is gonna result in this, and it's gonna get worse.""Others pointed to seasonal factors and fewer events compared to last year, like the absence of the NHL Awards and Draft, which had brought in thousands of out-of-towners in June 2024.And then there's the ultimate Reddit kiss of death:""Vegas will never recover.""Las Vegas' image isn't just suffering from a tourism dip — it's also grappling with lawsuits that could further damage its hospitality reputation. Earlier this year, three lawsuits were filed against two Strip resorts over alleged bedbug infestations during the summer of 2024.Attorney Brian Virag, founder of My Bed Bug Lawyer, is representing the plaintiffs.""We wanted to not only make sure to represent them, but also to bring awareness that bedbugs in Las Vegas hotels are a real problem,"" he told Fox News Digital.Mallory Dumond, a travel adviser at Travelmation, told Fox News that while the cost of visiting Las Vegas has surged, travellers can still find value with the right strategies.""Opt for a Sunday through Thursday stay if your schedule allows,"" she advised, ""you can find 5-star rooms at half the weekend rate.""Dumond recommends lunch over dinner at upscale restaurants to cut costs and suggests happy hour menus for wallet-friendly indulgence.","3.1 million tourists visited Las Vegas in June, a sharp 11.3% drop from the same time last year.

World's oldest baby: Boy born from 1994 embryo in 2025; Ohio couple celebrates IVF milestone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/worlds-oldest-baby-boy-born-from-1994-embryo-in-2025-ohio-couple-celebrates-ivf-milestone/articleshow/123058392.cms,"



A baby born in Ohio may have broken a world record, after developing from an embryo that was frozen for over 30 years before being successfully transferred.Lindsey and Tim Pierce welcomed their son last Saturday through embryo adoption, using one of a set of embryos donated back in 1994. The embryo that led to the birth had been stored for 11,148 days, a timespan that doctors say marks the longest an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a live birth.Embryo adoption, though still relatively uncommon, is attracting greater attention. Some fertility clinics and Christian adoption agencies support the practice as an alternative to discarding unused embryos, based on the belief that life begins at or near conception and that embryos deserve a chance to be born.“I felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,” said Linda Archerd, 62, who originally donated the embryos to the Pierces.In the United States, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) accounts for just about 2% of all births, and an even smaller portion involve embryos donated by other families. Yet experts say about 1.5 million embryos are currently frozen in storage across the country, many left unused while families decide what to do next.The issue has become even more complex following a 2024 ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court, which declared that frozen embryos should be considered the legal equivalent of children. While a temporary law now protects fertility clinics from liability in the state, uncertainty continues over what the future holds for unused embryos.Archerd turned to IVF in the 1990s, a time when advances in freezing, thawing, and transferring embryos were just beginning to offer more hopeful outcomes. After giving birth to her daughter, her plans to grow her family changed following a divorce. As the years went by and storage costs continued to mount, she found herself torn over what to do with the remaining embryos.Her search eventually led her to Snowflakes, a branch of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which helps arrange embryo adoptions and gives donors the option to choose adoptive families and stay in touch with them, CNN reported.“I wanted to be a part of this baby’s life,” Archerd said. “And I wanted to know the adopting parents.”The process wasn’t easy. Archerd had to contact her original clinic in Oregon and retrieve old paper records to authorise the donation. The embryos were then carefully shipped to Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, Tennessee, a clinic known for working with long-frozen embryos and refusing to discard any, regardless of age.Of the three embryos sent to the Pierces, one didn’t survive the thawing process. Two were transferred to Lindsey’s womb, but only one implanted successfully.John David Gordon, who oversaw the transfer, said the successful birth from a nearly 31-year-old embryo now breaks the previous record, also set at his clinic, when twins Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 10,905 days.“I think that these stories catch the imagination,” Gordon said. “But I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?”Lindsey and Tim Pierce weren’t aiming to break records, CNN cited the couple.“We didn’t go into this thinking about records, we just wanted to have a baby,” Lindsey said in a statement.For Archerd, the experience has been emotional, a blend of happiness that her embryos finally found a home, sadness that it wasn’t with her, and hope for a connection with the child she helped bring into the world.“I’m hoping that they’re going to send pictures,” she said. “I’d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet, meet them and the baby.”","Embryo adoption, though still relatively uncommon, is attracting greater attention. Some fertility clinics and Christian adoption agencies support the practice as an alternative to discarding unused embryos. Experts say about 1.5 million embryos are currently frozen in storage across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123058549,imgsize-148883,width-400,resizemode-4/123058549.jpg"

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Plaintiffs claim X made it hard to report child abuse







Broader concerns about CSAM handling on X persist

A federal appeals court has revived part of a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), of negligence in its response to child pornography content . While X benefits from broad immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the platform must still face claims that it failed to act promptly after learning of a sexually explicit video involving two underage boys. The court's decision highlights growing concerns over how social media platforms handle child exploitation online . The ruling reinforces a growing legal consensus that platforms may be liable for harms caused after they acquire actual knowledge of illegal content. It could also set a precedent for future CSAM-related litigation beyond X.Although Elon Musk was not personally named in the lawsuit and the case predates his acquisition of Twitter in 2022, X remains legally vulnerable due to how it handled the content once it had “actual knowledge.” Court documents state the platform took nine days to remove and report a video involving explicit images of minors—after it had been viewed over 167,000 times. Judge Danielle Forrest clarified that the statutory obligation to report child pornography overrides Section 230 protections once a platform becomes aware of such material.The plaintiffs—referred to as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2—were 13 and 14 years old when a predator, posing as a peer on Snapchat, coerced them into sending explicit content. That material was later posted to Twitter, where it remained despite multiple user reports and a complaint from one of the boy’s mothers. The court also revived a separate claim asserting that X’s infrastructure made it unnecessarily difficult for users to report child sexual abuse material, suggesting flaws in platform design and moderation workflows.Although some claims were dismissed—such as those alleging X profited from sex trafficking or designed features that ""amplify"" abuse—the lawsuit adds to existing criticism of the platform’s response to child sexual abuse material. Nonprofits like Thorn have severed ties with X over payment disputes and policy concerns, and watchdogs report that illicit hashtags and spam accounts still circulate CSAM. While X has announced improvements in detection technology, critics say progress remains insufficient amid persistent issues.","A federal appeals court has revived part of a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), of negligence in its response to child pornography content.

""Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service.""Sources familiar with the matter revealed that OpenAI was connecting Claude to internal tools through special developer APIs to benchmark Claude's performance against its own models in coding, writing, and safety categories. The company was also testing how Claude responded to safety-related prompts involving sensitive content like CSAM, self-harm, and defamation.OpenAI defended its actions as ""industry standard"" practice for evaluating AI systems. ""While we respect Anthropic's decision to cut off our API access, it's disappointing considering our API remains available to them,"" OpenAI's chief communications officer Hannah Wong said in a statement.Anthropic's commercial terms explicitly prohibit customers from using Claude to ""build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models."" However, the company stated it would continue providing OpenAI access ""for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations as is standard practice across the industry.""The access revocation comes amid explosive demand for Claude Code, Anthropic's AI-powered coding tool. The company recently announced new rate limits, citing unprecedented usage that has strained capacity.""Some of the biggest Claude Code fans are running it continuously in the background, 24/7,"" Anthropic tweeted. ""For example, one user consumed tens of thousands in model usage on a $200 plan.""This isn't Anthropic's first restriction on competitors. Last month, the company cut off AI coding startup Windsurf's access after rumors of an OpenAI acquisition. Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously said, ""I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.""The move reflects broader tensions in the AI industry, where companies increasingly restrict competitor access to their APIs—a tactic previously used by Facebook against Twitter-owned Vine and Salesforce against Slack competitors.","Anthropic has cut off OpenAI's API access to its Claude family of AI models.

Instagram live streaming rules change: Who can still go live and who’s restricted; check if you are on the list and other key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-live-streaming-rules-change-who-can-still-go-live-and-whos-restricted-check-if-you-are-on-the-list-and-other-key-details/articleshow/123073723.cms,"Instagram’s new update on live streaming policy



Why did Instagram make this change? Potential reasons behind the update

Improved streaming quality and user experience:

Focus on monetisation and professional content:

Industry alignment:

New Instagram live rules frustrate small creators

Stifling creativity and community

Encouragement of artificial growth:

Prioritising profit over users:

How does this impact Instagram users moving forward

Established creators benefit:

Small accounts must adapt:

Shift towards professionalism:

Instagram has introduced a major policy update limiting access to its popular Live streaming feature. Previously, any user could go Live, regardless of their follower count or account privacy settings. Now, only users with at least 1,000 followers and a public account can initiate Live broadcasts. This change aligns Instagram with platforms like TikTok, which have a similar follower minimum to use live streaming. While Instagram hasn’t officially explained the rationale, the move appears aimed at enhancing the quality and relevance of live content on the platform, reducing infrastructure costs, and steering creators towards more professional, monetized use cases. However, this decision has sparked concerns about its impact on smaller creators and everyday users who relied on Live for casual social interaction.The new rule requires users to have a minimum of 1,000 followers and maintain a public account to access Instagram’s Live feature. Users who don’t meet these criteria will see a notification that reads:“Your account is no longer eligible for Live. We changed the requirements to use this feature. Only public accounts with 1,000 followers or more will be able to create live videos.” This essentially limits Live streaming to more established users, restricting smaller accounts and private profiles from broadcasting live content. The update marks a shift in Instagram’s approach, transforming Live from an inclusive social tool to a feature that favors creators with larger audiences.Although Instagram has not publicly detailed the reasons, experts and user feedback suggest several motivations:Live video demands substantial real-time bandwidth and server resources. Limiting the feature to larger accounts could reduce network strain and improve streaming stability for viewers and broadcasters.By favoring accounts with bigger followings, Instagram is likely prioritizing creators who use Live for business, influencer marketing, and branded content, aligning with Meta’s monetization goals.TikTok and other social platforms already require a follower threshold to go live, so Instagram is possibly standardizing its policies to compete and maintain advertiser interest.This approach reflects a broader industry trend where live streaming is becoming more about professional content and less about casual social sharing.The update has met with mixed reactions from Instagram’s community, especially among small creators and casual users. Many feel this change limits opportunities for organic growth and reduces the platform’s inclusivity. Common concerns include:: Smaller creators and everyday users often used Live for personal connections, casual chats, or niche hobbies. Restricting access may discourage authentic, grassroots engagement.Some fear the policy will drive people to buy fake followers or use bots just to unlock Live, undermining genuine community building.Several users criticize Instagram for prioritizing monetized content and brand deals, sidelining users who don’t generate revenue.Social media commentators have called the move “a push towards commercialization” that risks alienating loyal, smaller creators who helped build Instagram’s community.For creators and users, the implications are significant:Influencers and larger accounts gain more exclusive control over live content, potentially increasing their visibility and monetization options.Users with fewer than 1,000 followers will need to explore other engagement strategies or focus on growing their audience before accessing Live streaming.Instagram is clearly steering Live towards use cases involving brand promotion, influencer marketing, and advertiser-friendly content rather than casual personal sharing.This shift may reshape how communities interact on Instagram and influence where smaller creators choose to invest their time and energy.","Instagram has introduced a major policy update limiting access to its popular Live streaming feature.
