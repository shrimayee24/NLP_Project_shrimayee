Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox. Fans are, therefore, speculating, it is just a hoax, like all the other times before. So, until any confirmation is received, one can relax and continue playing their favorite on the platform.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, Roblox repeatedly denied the claims of Roblox shutdown rumors, calling it a hoax and giving reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true. Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the play-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

What did Alexis Lete claim against Cora Jade?



Former WWE Recruit Reveals Insider Secrets: Affairs, Scripting, & Culture

Cora Jade breaks her silence on social media



Cora Jade has fired back after being accused of bullying by former WWE Performance Center trainee Alexis Lete. Lete, a model and ex-volleyball player who briefly signed with WWE in 2022 before being released a year later, recently appeared on That One Time podcast. She claimed Jade was one of her “main bullies” during her time at the Orlando training facility, pointing to a dispute over a TikTok video as one example. Now, Jade has broken her silence with a pointed response.During the That One Time podcast, Alexis Lete shared her perspective on her short stint in WWE, praising Roxanne Perez as “such a sweet human” but insisting that Cora Jade made her experience difficult. According to Lete, the tension began when Jade texted her to take down a TikTok she believed exposed the wrestling business. Lete said she refused because she did not feel the post revealed anything damaging.“She’s like, ‘You’re exposing the whole industry,’” Lete recalled. “I wasn’t. I did not give away anything kayfabe.

We’re planning out the fight,’ but I didn’t say I was planning it with my competition.”Lete alleged Jade was “butthurt that like, she couldn’t control me” and accused her of being “really mean” to new recruits.She also said Jade didn’t make herself approachable, claiming that while other trainees offered help, Jade “would literally turn away from us” when approached.Jade, who now competes under the name Elayna Black following her WWE release, took to social media with a lengthy response. She was adamant that she would only address the allegations once.“I shouldn’t be giving this girl an ounce more of my energy but this will be the one and only time I speak on this and if you know you know,” Jade wrote. “This girl came into the pc and immediately had heat with everyone for being disrespectful on more than one occasion.”Jade said she initially tried to intervene on Lete’s behalf, texting her to offer guidance before the situation escalated further. “I texted this girl trying to HELP before her heat got worse (that had already travelled up to main roster before she even had a match). I’ll go ahead and post the screenshots myself. She chose to basically tell me to fck off and then continue to get heat for weeks.”She added that Lete only apologized after multiple main roster names confronted her about her behavior. “I told her I appreciate the apology but I don’t respect how she handles things and the ways she disrespects pro wrestling,” Jade continued. “I came from Indy wrestling, absolutely loved wrestling and was trying to carry on the love and respect that was there when I got there in black and gold.”Dismissing the accusation altogether, Jade said: “I spoke to her maybe 5 times total [if] that.

Government steps in to investigate Kick following streamer Jean Pormanove’s tragic death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/government-steps-in-to-investigate-kick-following-streamer-jean-pormanoves-tragic-death/articleshow/123444960.cms,"(Image via streetgrind's ""X"" Account)

French authorities launch a Judicial probe into Jean Pormanove’s tragic death



Broadcast tragic events that led to government intervention



Kick and its controversial history



French authorities have reportedly opened a judicial investigation into Kick, the live-streaming platform. It comes after the tragic death of popular streamer Jean Pormanove during the ongoing live broadcast. The intervention of the government signals some concerns over Kick’s practices and their duty of care. The probe will expectedly be examining the circumstances that surround this incident as well as the role of the platform in moderating the extreme content.A judicial investigation, as per reports, is underway by the French authorities to determine the full scope of the events which led to such a tragedy. The Digital Affairs and AI minister of France has publicly criticized the platform and confirmed the investigation. He stated that Kick has failed to censor content or remove the broadcast timely. Such an official response has underscored the seriousness with which Jean Pormanove’s case is being treated by the government. It places Kick and its policies under direct scrutiny.The investigation conducted would delve in the specific nature of livestreams that are days-long. It would also look into the alleged actions of the others who remain involved.The move signals a potential shift within how the government might choose to regulate the online content, holding the platforms much more accountable for what live broadcast is to their audiences. Moreover, the focus isn't a single event. It is in the broader ecosystem that permits the high-risk contents to get aired and to be online even long after the alarms get raised.Jean Pormanove, also known as Raphael Graven, was a 46-year-old streamer. He was in the midst of an extreme marathon broadcast that was running for over 280 hours (Death game). As per reports from the French media, the streamer was subjected to a prolonged period, which is described as torture. It included severe deprivation of sleep, attempted suffocation, and some electrical shocks.During this ongoing stream, Pormanove, as per reports, sent a note to his mother. He in it expressed his desire for leaving but as per him, he was “locked in.” The condition of the streamer was unnoticed till the viewer donated to alert others that the streamer appeared unresponsive.The co-streamer, Oven “Naruto” Cenazandott, was further seen in the video throwing a water bottle at Pormanove, trying to wake him, before ending his live feed. Just as authorities arrived at the scene, they found Pormanove to be alone and unconscious. He was later pronounced dead.This particular incident isn’t the first event where the platform seemed to have failed. It has just instead amplified the existing concerns about the approach of Kick to content moderation. The platform, which is known for the creator-friendly split of revenue, built a reputation for having looser regulations than the competitors. It has made it a destination for the streamers pushing boundaries with the violent stunts and some humiliating content. It often targeted vulnerable individuals.The co-streamers of Pormanove, Naruto, and Safine Hamadi were previously arrested in 2025 on suspicion of producing humiliating videos. However, their release was quick and their continued presence on the platform highlighted the challenges that Kick faces in policing creators. In response to the public outcry now, Kick has banned involved streamers, pending the investigation’s outcome.","French authorities have reportedly opened a judicial investigation into Kick, the live-streaming platform.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused the company of racism.

In a significant anti-narcotics operation, Abu Dhabi Police, in collaboration with the National Drug Control Service, have seized 377 kilograms of crystal meth and arrested three individuals. The suspects, Asian nationals, had attempted to conceal the drugs inside oil cans intended for sewing machines, deploying what authorities described as a ""sophisticated"" smuggling method. The bust not only highlights the vigilance of local law enforcement but also underscores the role of public reporting tools like the Aman Service in combating crime.Abu Dhabi Police announced the successful dismantling of a drug smuggling operation involving three Asian nationals who were found in possession of a large quantity of crystal methamphetamine, weighing a total of 377 kilograms. The operation was executed in coordination with the National Drug Control Service, reflecting a joint effort to target and eliminate narcotics trafficking in the region.According to Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Criminal Security Sector, the gang employed an unconventional concealment method by hiding the crystal meth inside oil cans manufactured for sewing machines.Authorities noted that this attempt to bypass detection systems demonstrated a high level of planning and ingenuity.However, the operation was foiled thanks to what Brig. Al Dhaheri described as the ""expertise and vigilance"" of the anti-narcotics teams. He emphasized that their ability to detect and intercept such a well-disguised cargo speaks to the strength of the emirate’s ongoing counter-narcotics strategy, which is supported by Abu Dhabi’s leadership and aligned with the national drug control agenda.After their arrest, the suspects were referred to the competent authority for legal proceedings.Alongside details of the bust, Abu Dhabi Police issued a strong public advisory warning residents not to fall prey to the common misconception that drug use leads to happiness or comfort. Brig. Al Dhaheri highlighted the serious negative effects of drug abuse, particularly its toll on personal health and public safety.Police reiterated that drugs, regardless of how they are presented or marketed by traffickers, carry grave health risks and contribute to broader social harm. They urged all community members to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity involving narcotics or related crimes.To support these efforts, the police pointed to the Aman Service, Abu Dhabi’s official platform for reporting cybercrimes and other serious offenses. Established in 2009, the Aman Service allows the public to confidentially share information related to security, cybercrimes, traffic incidents, and community threats.The service operates 24/7, year-round, and is not intended for filing police reports but specifically for providing intelligence or information that may help authorities prevent or investigate crimes.The Aman call centre supports Arabic, English, and Urdu, ensuring access for a wide range of residents. Authorities guarantee complete confidentiality for all individuals using the service to report criminal or suspicious activities.Residents are encouraged to use Aman to report incidents such as unauthorized access to personal accounts, blackmail, privacy violations, or the distribution of malicious content.","Gang hid 377kg of crystal meth inside oil cans made specifically for sewing machines, using them to bypass security detectors.

Abu Dhabi will extend Darb road toll operating hours by an additional two hours daily from September 1, 2025, as part of updates aimed at easing city traffic congestion and encouraging public transport use. The new rules also scrap the daily and monthly fee caps, marking major changes for regular commuters across the capital.From September 1, 2025, motorists in Abu Dhabi will pay Dh4 for each trip through Darb toll gates between 3pm and 7pm (Monday to Saturday), in addition to the unchanged morning window of 7am to 9am.

Abu Dhabi’s four main toll gates are at Sheikh Khalifa Bridge, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, Al Maqta Bridge, and Musaffah Bridge, key entrance points to the city.

By increasing efficiency, the corridor is built to support higher passenger volumes during peak times without adding congestion.





Dubai International Airport has launched a cutting-edge, AI-powered corridor that allows travellers to bypass traditional passport control in seconds. Unveiled by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), the new system can process multiple passengers simultaneously—marking a global first in airport immigration technology and advancing Dubai’s vision for seamless, document-free travel.Dubai has introduced the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered immigration corridor at Dubai International Airport (DXB), which has retained its title as the busiest international airport for the 11th consecutive year. The initiative was officially announced by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of the GDRFA.This innovation enables passengers to walk across a special passage—referred to internally as the “red carpet”—to complete immigration formalities without stopping or presenting travel documents. Up to ten passengers can pass through at the same time, a significant improvement over the traditional one-passenger-at-a-time model.The AI corridor is a major step within Dubai’s broader “travel without borders” strategy. It is designed as part of a larger integrated system aimed at providing faster, smoother, and more secure transit for travellers.The AI corridor processes passenger information automatically and in real time.Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system identifies and verifies travellers before they reach the immigration checkpoint, allowing them to walk through without presenting ID or stopping for inspection.Despite the speed and simplicity, security is not compromised. The system includes built-in mechanisms that flag any suspicious passports and immediately route them to forgery experts for review. This ensures robust screening while reducing manual workload and queue times.As a result, overall processing capacity has doubled, helping reduce congestion and improving efficiency during high-traffic periods.Lieutenant General Al Marri highlighted that DXB is not merely a transit point but a prominent international gateway that reflects the UAE’s progressive identity and hospitality. The launch of the AI-powered corridor reinforces Dubai’s standing as a hub of technological innovation and operational excellence.He further stated that the GDRFA’s work aligns with a long-term innovation roadmap that focuses on leveraging technology to modernise and streamline border control procedures. The shift toward automated, document-free travel is expected to become a defining feature of global air travel, with Dubai leading that transformation.","Dubai's AI-powered immigration corridor at DXB processes ten passengers at once, enabling seamless, document-free entry using biometric verification.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence.

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan.

‘My parties are way cooler than HBO’s Silicon Valley’: Elon Musk told Kumail Nanjiani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/my-parties-are-way-cooler-than-hbos-silicon-valley-elon-musk-told-kumail-nanjiani/articleshow/123427226.cms,"

Elon Musk dismisses Silicon Valley’s portrayal of tech life



Kumail Nanjiani meets the real tech giants

Silicon Valley: Satire versus reality

The parties that made headlines





Kumail Nanjiani, the 47-year-old actor and comedian best known for HBO’s hit comedy Silicon Valley, recently shared a candid encounter with Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and the world’s richest man. Speaking on Mike Birbiglia’s podcast, Nanjiani revealed that Musk was not a fan of the show’s depiction of start-up culture. “He was like, all the parties I go to are much cooler than these parties,” Nanjiani recalled. The actor added with humour, “Of course your parties are better than my parties,” acknowledging Musk’s unmatched lifestyle, influence in tech, and his flair for extravagant gatherings.Nanjiani shared that when he met Musk, the billionaire CEO openly criticised the show’s depiction of start-up culture and tech parties. Musk reportedly said that the fictional parties on Silicon Valley were nothing compared to the extravagant gatherings he attends in real life. While the show lampooned eccentricities, “brogrammer” antics, and start-up drama, Musk’s comment highlighted the sheer scale and spectacle of his social circle. Nanjiani laughed off the remark, acknowledging the truth: in a world of billionaires and high-powered entrepreneurs, television can only capture a fraction of the excess and energy of real-life tech events.Nanjiani has met several influential figures in Silicon Valley, including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. While the show satirised their world, not all tech leaders appreciated the humour. Musk’s candid reaction exemplifies the gap between fictionalised satire and the real-life personas of tech billionaires. For Nanjiani, these encounters offered both a reality check and a humorous perspective on how the people being lampooned perceive their own world. It also highlighted the challenges actors face when portraying living icons—balancing comedy with authenticity in a universe where reality often outshines fiction.Created by Mike Judge, Silicon Valley aired for six series and 53 episodes, following programmer Richard Hendricks and his friends as they launched the start-up Pied Piper. Critics praised the show’s clever writing and its sharp take on corporate absurdities, “brogrammer” culture, and venture capital chaos. Musk’s remark underscores the difference between what television can depict and the high-energy, high-stakes world of actual tech elites. While the series exaggerated certain situations for comedic effect, real-world tech parties often feature more extravagance, exclusivity, and networking intensity than even the sharpest satire could fully capture.Tech industry gatherings have often drawn attention for their lavishness and boundary-pushing nature. Emily Chang’s book Brotopia documented gatherings involving fancy dress, drugs, and social experiments testing norms and relationships. Musk, who attended at least one high-profile 2017 party, denied any inappropriate activity, calling it a costume party he left early. This distinction highlights the gap between public perception and reality in Silicon Valley’s elite circles. Musk’s comment about his parties being superior is not just playful bragging—it’s also a nod to the sheer scale, exclusivity, and spectacle of gatherings among tech billionaires.","Kumail Nanjiani, the 47-year-old actor and comedian best known for HBO’s hit comedy Silicon Valley, recently shared a candid encounter with Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Medical technology company Masimo has sued US Customs and Border Protection , alleging the agency improperly allowed Apple to import its smartwatches with blood-oxygen sensors. The lawsuit claims that Customs reversed a previous decision without notifying Masimo, a key player in the ongoing patent dispute between the two companies. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the lawsuit, which was filed in a Washington, DC federal court, Masimo claimed learning about the agency’s August 1 decision only after Apple announced it would reintroduce the blood-oxygen feature to its watches last week. Masimo, which is based in Irvine, California, has separately accused Apple in federal court of hiring its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology.In 2023, Masimo convinced the US International Trade Commission to block imports of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches, after determining that Apple’s blood oxygen technology infringed Masimo’s patents.Since then, Apple has sold redesigned versions of the watches without pulse oximetry, which US Customs have approved. Earlier this month, Apple said it would restore the blood-oxygen feature with Customs’ approval. At the same time, Masimo argued that the decision was made without its input or sufficient explanation, undermining the company’s rights, the Reuters report noted.Masimo said as per the Reuters report.Masimo has also asked the Washington court to overturn the agency’s ruling and maintain the ban on Apple selling watches with the blood-oxygen feature.Last year, a federal jury in Delaware awarded Apple $250 after determining that Masimo's original smartwatch designs infringed on Apple's design patents. While this ruling favoured Apple, its scope was limited, as it mostly applied to older Masimo products.","Medical technology company Masimo has sued US Customs and Border Protection, alleging the agency improperly allowed Apple to import its smartwatches with blood-oxygen sensors.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
