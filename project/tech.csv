Travis Kelce defends his Guardians fandom after facing unusual criticism for his ALCS game 1 look



The Cleveland Guardians ' victory over the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the 2024 ALCS was a moment of triumph for fans across the city. Among the elated supporters was Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , a die-hard Guardians fan. However, Kelce's enthusiasm was met with an unexpected twist: a wardrobe controversy. Despite attending Game 1 of the series with Taylor Swift , Kelce opted to skip the Guardians' gear, sparking confusion and criticism among fans.Some questioned his sincerity as a fan, suggesting that his lack of team attire indicated a lack of commitment.Also Read: Denver Broncos dominate the Saints, 33-10, in Sean Payton’s long-awaited return to His Former Home However, Kelce made his stance clear after the Guardians secured their dramatic walk-off win in Game 3. Following the game, Kelce took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to express his excitement and address those doubting his fandom. The tight end, who grew up in Ohio and played football at the University of Cincinnati, found it baffling that anyone would doubt his allegiance based solely on his clothing choice.It seems odd that such attention would be paid to an outfit, but in today’s digital age, fans often read too much into trivial details. Kelce’s response, defending his lifelong connection to Cleveland sports, couldn’t have come at a better time. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a true fan was Kelce's clear message, emphasizing that his love for the team runs far deeper than just wearing their gear. After all, Kelce’s Ohio upbringing has been a well-known part of his public persona, and his passion for Cleveland sports is something he regularly shares with fans.Following his Twitter response, the Guardians, still basking in the glow of their Game 3 triumph, joined in on the fun. Their social media account poked some lighthearted fun at Kelce, indicating they were more than happy with his support, regardless of what he wore to the game.Kelce has yet to officially rank his favorite MLB teams, but his continued support of the Guardians over the years speaks volumes. Born in Westlake, Ohio, and a Cleveland Heights High School alum, Kelce often references his Cleveland roots alongside his brother Jason on their podcast “New Heights,” which pays homage to their upbringing. Whether or not he dons team apparel, Kelce’s loyalty to his hometown team remains unquestionable, much like his unwavering pride in Cleveland itself.Also Read: Saints CB Marshon Lattimore ruled out during the game against the Broncos after sustaining a hamstring injury","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is a die-hard Cleveland Guardians fan.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Early Success

Pro Model Surge

Challenges Ahead

Long-Term Outlook

Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16 , has good news for Apple in China . Bloomberg reports strong sales for Apple's newest iPhone in China, quoting research firm Counterpoint. Compared to the 2023 model, sales are up 20% in the first three weeks, according to Counterpoint Research data. This is a positive sign for Apple, after facing challenges in the crucial Chinese market last year.Though the smartphone market is stagnant, the iPhone remains Apple's most crucial product, generating roughly half of its sales.Strong iPhone sales in China are a positive indicator for Apple's overall performance.The iPhone 16's success can be attributed to several factors. A smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and existing user upgrades all contributed to ""substantial growth"" in China, said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam.Consumers are also gravitating towards pricier options, with sales of the top-tier Pro and Pro Max models jumping 44% compared to their predecessors.Despite the promising start, competition remains fierce. Local rivals like Vivo's X200 Pro, Huawei's upcoming Mate device, and updates from Xiaomi and Oppo threaten to steal market share. Additionally, the ongoing economic slowdown in China might lead some consumers to delay purchases until major shopping holidays like Singles' Day in November.While the iPhone 16 boasts AI features, the lack of a local partner for these features in China poses a potential hurdle. Analysts previously expressed concerns about this, as Beijing restricts foreign-developed AI models. Apple may need to collaborate with a Chinese company like Baidu to fully utilize these features in the region.While the initial response is positive, it remains to be seen how the iPhone 16 will fare throughout its lifespan. The success will depend on navigating intense competition and the ongoing economic climate in China.","Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16, has good news for Apple in China.

How this move may alter the map viewing experience







Google Maps' India-centric features



Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface. The tech giant is testing a new design of its maps service by relocating the weather widget to the ""Latest in the area"" sheet that appears from the bottom of the screen. Previously displayed in the top-left corner, the weather information is now reportedly appearing in the top-right corner of this expandable sheet.According to a report by 9to5Google, this change aims to declutter the map view and provide Google Maps users with a cleaner and less obstructed experience.The report also includes screenshots to show when the ""Latest in the area"" sheet is minimised, the weather widget appears in the bottom-right corner, allowing users to quickly access information without hiding the map.The latest update follows another recent simplification effort by Google, where the app's bottom bar was reduced from five tabs to three.While this change aims to declutter the map view, it may make it slightly less convenient to quickly check the weather while exploring the map.Currently available in the beta version (11.151.x) of Google Maps, this update hides the weather information behind an extra tap. Users who prefer to see the temperature, conditions, and AQI at a glance may find this change less efficient.It remains to be seen whether this design will make its way to the stable release of Google Maps. Feedback from beta testers will likely play a role in Google's decision to roll out this change more broadly.In July, Google Maps added 6 new features which are designed specifically for Indian users . These features use AI and collaborations with local experts to address common challenges faced by commuters across the country.With these features, Indian users got access to AI-driven navigation that optimises routes, information on EV charging stations, and enhanced public transport options. Additionally, Google Maps also partnered with local guides to provide curated recommendations for places to visit and things to do.These updates reflect Google's commitment to tailoring its services to the specific needs of users in different regions. By incorporating AI and local expertise, Google Maps aims to provide a more seamless and informative navigation experience for commuters in India.","Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface.

Prabhakar Raghavan

will transition to the role of Chief Technologist

Google has appointed Nick Fox, a seasoned leader within the company's search and ads division

Here's the memo Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent to Google employees:

Hi Googlers,

It's been an exciting few days for AI across our products. We saw NotebookLM with Audio Overviews go viral, added more ways to find information in Search and Lens, and launched a revamped Google Shopping for the AI era. We also just shared a big milestone in our work to help doctors use AI to detect diabetic retinopathy: 600,000 screenings and counting, and we’re expanding access to more people across India and Thailand. There’s a lot more to come.

AI moves faster than any technology before it. To keep increasing the pace of progress, we've been making shifts to simplify our structures along the way, including the creation of Google DeepMind and the joining of the Platforms & Devices teams. As a next step, Prabhakar and I have been thinking through how to structure our Knowledge & Information team for the Gemini era, and today we shared the following changes:

The Gemini app team led by Sissie will join Google DeepMind under Demis. As the name suggests, the Gemini app is the direct consumer interface to the latest and greatest Gemini models. Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app, make our post-training work proceed more efficiently and build on our great product momentum.

The Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to Platforms & Devices so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for and bring our AI-powered home initiatives into one team and focus on improving user experience.

In parallel to this, Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career. After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.
