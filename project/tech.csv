What is Blue alert?







Blue alert has been issued in Texas as authorities continue their search for a 12th suspect in what officials describe as a July 4 “ambush” at the ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Fox4 reported.Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.The suspect, a former US Marine Corps Reservist of five years, allegedly used two AR-15-style rifles to fire at three officers during the ambush.Moreover, the FBI has offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song's arrest.A Blue alert is a public safety notification system used to help locate and apprehend suspects who have seriously injured or killed a law enforcement officer. Much like Amber or Silver alerts, it leverages broadcast and digital platforms to quickly inform the public and encourage tips that may lead to an arrest.To issue a Blue alert, specific conditions must be met: a law enforcement officer must have been killed or critically injured; the suspect must pose a serious threat to the public or other officers; and there must be identifying information such as a vehicle description or license plate that can be shared widely.Additionally, the investigating agency must recommend activation to the Texas department of public safety.Currently, Texas is one of 34 US states that operate a Blue alert system, using it as a tool to engage the public in high-priority manhunts where officer safety and community risk are at stake.","Benjamin Hanil Song of Dallas faces six pending charges for allegedly opening fire on two correctional officers and an Alvarado police officer during the Prairieland detention center ambush.

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah James, occasionally share glimpses of their more than $23 million Los Angeles home on Instagram. The Los Angeles Lakers star's lavish abode offers ample space for them and their three children to grow up in luxury — while still maintaining a strong connection to nature. As fans love to catch glimpses of the interiors in the background of their posts, here’s a detailed look at their stunning house.King James’ all-white mansion is located in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. It features eight bedrooms and a host of amenities fit for royalty. There are 11 bathrooms, along with spaces like a billiards room, theater room, cigar room, and an onyx bar.The home’s color palette is washed in white and nude tones, with marble accents adding to the aesthetic appeal. The patio features full marble flooring, seamlessly connecting the interior with the outdoors in a unified design. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors make the home bright and airy while enhancing that indoor-outdoor flow. The house also boasts a spacious terrace and patio area where the family can unwind and enjoy the fresh air.LeBron James' dedication to fitness is well-known, so it’s no surprise the mansion includes not only a fully equipped gym, but also a spa with a steam room, shower, sauna, and massage room.A massive pool is also available — perfect for a family of tall athletes, with LeBron himself standing at 6 feet 9 inches.According to a Business Insider report, the outdoor kitchen includes a barbecue area and beer taps, ensuring guests enjoy uninterrupted refreshments.Savannah once shared a glimpse of their lavish staircase which has artworks on the walls adjacent to it. Another video shared by her, featuring Zhuri, also showed areas of their living room.Also Read: Savannah James shares glimpses from her daughter Zhuri's lavish bedroom while making a hilarious claim LeBron and Savannah’s eldest son, Bronny James, 20, also lives at home. Since he plays for the Lakers' Summer League team and LeBron is with the Los Angeles Lakers, living under one roof offers comfort and convenience. With the mansion’s fitness amenities, it also makes sense for the entire family to benefit from the setup. LeBron’s younger son, Bryce James, 18, is also a basketball player, and their daughter, Zhuri James, 10, plays volleyball.","Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah James, occasionally share glimpses of their more than $23 million Los Angeles home on Instagram.

"""People are so stupid"": Pirate Software denies using fake voice amid allegations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/people-are-so-stupid-pirate-software-denies-using-fake-voice-amid-allegations/articleshow/122346829.cms,"Image via: Twitch/Pirate Software

Pirate Software Denies Fake Voice



JUST NOW: Pirate Software is getting sued. He's done.

A History of Lies?

Persona or Performance?

I reviewed Pirate Software's code. Oh boy...

Twitch streamer, indie game developer and YouTuber Jason “Pirate Software” is back in the internet hot seat, but this time, it’s not about game design or quirky life advice. In a frenzy of conjecture, Pirate Software has been accused of faking his voice, something he finds ludicrous.The controversy ignited where a 30-second excerpt of Pirate Software replying to a chat comment rapidly accumulated views. One viewer curtly asserted, ‘100%, not his usual voice,’ implying Pirate’s unique style of speaking was faked either via digitization or acting.Instead of dismissing the jab, Pirate doubled down on it with a typically frank and frustrated reply,""100%, not his normal voice.' How would I maintain it for 12 hours a day? Insane memes. Just go to my next meet and greet, and record me. Like, I'll do one at TwitchCon San Diego. Be there! 'It's the voice chip, of course.' Yeah. 'They'll edit your voice.' I know, dude! They're going to do some weird bulls**t.”His tone betrayed not simply frustration but weariness with a pattern on the internet, individual conjecture masquerading as objective reality, and frequently unfounded.This isn’t the first time Pirate Software’s rhetoric has stoked a firestorm.Among the jokes in a resurfaced podcast clip that he once worked on hacking power plants for the U.S. which stirred envy throughout the tech creator world.The sweeping claim assisted in sketching out the narrative of a hacker-turned-gamedev with an exciting history. It attracted skepticism. Top tech creator Coding Jesus questioned that assertion, asserting it was just another instance of Pirate Software possibly exaggerating qualifications for bragging rights or personal development.The core of the argument isn’t merely the voice. It’s about realness in the creator economy. For developers such as Pirate Software, who combine narrative, broadcasting, and cult game creation, the boundary between themselves and their digital personas can be blurry. Pirate insists there’s no “act” here.In an online age when creators are treated more like celebrities than hobbyists, even something as intimate as your native voice can be up for public debate. For Pirate Software, who built a cult following on candor, coding insight and quirky charm, the suggestion that he’s a phony is an assault on his very essence.","Pirate Software has been accused of faking his voice, something he finds ludicrous.

"Dallas Stars sign Antonio Stranges to one-year, two-way contract",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/dallas-stars-sign-antonio-stranges-to-one-year-two-way-contract/articleshow/122350378.cms,"Photo Credit: @LondonKnights/ Twitter

Impressive AHL breakout season helps Antonio Stranges secure new contract

What comes next for Antonio Stranges and his future with Dallas

The Dallas Stars have secured young forward Antonio Stranges for another season, signing the restricted free agent to a one-year, two-way deal. The contract, announced by his agent Dan Milstein and reported by PuckPedia, is worth $775,000 at the NHL level and $100,000 in the AHL. The 23-year-old left-winger is coming off a productive year in the AHL and will look to continue building momentum.Antonio Stranges, a 2020 fourth-round pick by Dallas, took a major step forward last season with AHL Texas, posting 18 goals and 25 assists for 43 points in 55 games. His offensive output marked a breakout campaign after an injury-filled 2022-23 season that saw him split time between AHL Texas and ECHL Idaho.Stranges, known for his high-end skill and speed, signed his entry-level deal in 2022 after wrapping up his junior career with the OHL’s London Knights. Despite facing consistency issues early in his pro journey, he has gradually developed into a reliable AHL scoring option.While Stranges is unlikely to earn a spot on the Stars' NHL opening night roster, his progress has not gone unnoticed. Given that he will need to clear waivers to be assigned to the minors, Dallas could face a tough decision if he continues to impress during training camp.If he can replicate or exceed last season’s AHL performance in 2025–26, Stranges could position himself for a one-way contract and a more serious NHL opportunity in 2026–27. His age and experience keep him in the restricted free agent category next summer, provided the Stars extend another qualifying offer.Despite still being too young for unrestricted Group VI status, Stranges remains a long-term development project with upside. The Stars’ willingness to bring him back for another year reflects belief in his potential to contribute in a bottom-six NHL role down the line.Antonio Stranges’ new contract with the Dallas Stars is a low-risk, high-upside move that continues his steady development arc. With a strong showing in the AHL last season, the 23-year-old forward will look to prove he’s ready to make the jump to the next level, and potentially earn a more permanent role in Dallas in the years ahead.Also Read: NHL draft favorite Gavin McKenna chooses Penn State after $700K NIL offer","Antonio Stranges has signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Dallas Stars.

What makes Cardlewise crib special



How the Patil couple created Cradlewise



OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is known for his expertise in the field of artificial intelligence. However, the OpenAI CEO has now become a breakout influencer in the segment of baby technology— all thanks to his social media post on the smart crib. In April this year, Altman posted a personal parenting tip on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). In the post shared, the OpenAI CEO recommended a smart crib— Cradlewise crib. It is an AI-powered bassinet made by an Indian startup founders Radhika and Bharath Patil. “We bought a lot of silly baby things that we haven’t needed,” Altman wrote. “But I definitely recommend a Cradlewise crib and a lot more burp rags than you think you could possibly need.”Sam Altman shared the post just weeks after he and his partner Oliver Mulherin welcomed their first child. The post sent Cradlewise’s website traffic soaring by over 30% in 24 hours and it also led to a spike on Google searches and sales.Cradlewise crib comes with a price tag of $1,999 and it AI and motion sensors to detect when a baby is about to wake and gently rocks them back to sleep. The smart crib also consists of built-in baby monitor, white noise machine and a mobile app for real-time updates. This makes the crib a very useful device for the parents.Along with this, the crib also learns the sleep pattern of the baby and then offer personalised care by reducing nighttime disruptions. As the baby grows, the bassinet can also be converted into a crib further increasing its utility.The startup was founded in Bengaluru in 2016. Now based in the US, Cradlewise was a result of parenting struggles faced by the Patil couple. Altman’s endorsement, though unsolicited, was a “surreal and humbling moment,” co-founder Radhika Patil told Business Insider.""But more than the numbers, what stayed with me was seeing a tech visionary resonate with a product built with empathy, intention, and science,"" added Patil.","Cradlewise crib comes with a price tag of $1,999 and it AI and motion sensors to detect when a baby is about to wake and gently rocks them back to sleep.

The internet is once again on fire, and this time, it's over Dean Withers. The streamer has landed in hot water after being accused of doxing and allegedly making a CPS (Child Protective Services) call on another creator.

But recently, things spiraled way beyond debates and content—it gotThings kicked off when Dean got into an online beef with another creator. Dean was accused of going beyond the platform drama and leaking personal information—aka doxing.One clip circulating shows Dean allegedly reading out names and partial addresses. Although he never showed full details, people were quick to call it intentional.This is where it gets serious. Multiple creators online claimed that Dean may have been involved in filing a CPS report on the other creator he was feuding with.No official documents have surfaced yet, but leaked DMs and voice clips suggest that someone close to Dean—or possibly Dean himself—made the call.Naturally, the internet lost it. Doxing is one thing. But dragging Child Protective Services into a content spat? That’s a whole new level of low.Instead of laying low or addressing the matter seriously, Dean went. In a stream, he joked about how peopleand said the CPS situation wasFans weren’t laughing. Clips of his mockery started spreading fast, and even creators who previously supported him started pulling back.The community is divided. Some say there’s no hard proof of Dean actually making the CPS call, and that everyone’s overreacting. Others believe even entertaining the idea—especially in a joking tone—is already crossing a line.Reddit threads, X/Twitter spaces, YouTube callouts—Dean is everywhere right now. And whether you think he messed up or not, it’s clear that the trust is broken.","Streamer Dean Withers is accused of doxing and filing a CPS report on another creator.

The latest addition to Barbie’s Fashionistas line is not a runway model but a real‑world rendition. Dressed in a sky‑blue polka‑dot crop top, matching ruffled miniskirt and chunky heels, the new Barbie carries an insulin pump at her waist and a continuous glucose monitor on her arm, representing the first-ever doll to represent type 1 diabetes.Mattel, the prime manufacturer of Barbie dolls collaborated with Breakthrough T1D (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) to mirror the growing reality of society with growing cases of diabetes, especially among children.Barbie dolls have come a long way since their 1959 debut, when they ideally represented white, rail‑thin, and locked into the single occupation of a fashion model. Over the years, Mattel has pushed the envelope on inclusivity, adding more than 175 different looks that vary in skin tone, body type, hairstyle and ability.In recent years, the Fashionistas collection has included dolls with behind‑the‑ear hearing aids, a blind Barbie with a cane, a doll sporting a prosthetic leg, another with vitiligo, and another with Down syndrome. By adding type 1 diabetes to the order, Barbie dolls will serve as a beacon of hope among children who will see their own stories and those of their friends.Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system targets insulin‑producing pancreatic cells, leaving patients dependent on insulin delivered by injection or pump.Mattel captures that medical condition in a miniature doll, with a waist‑mounted pump, button‑sized sensor held by heart‑shaped tape, and a light‑blue purse stocked with supplies and snacks to steady blood sugar highs and lows.

A striking video of a huge shelf cloud moving over the Washington DC area has gone viral on social media. It appeared as strong storms hit the region, with weather officials warning about flash floods and severe thunderstorms in and around the capital.The video, shared on X, was reportedly taken in Bowie, Maryland. It shows a dark, low cloud spreading across the suburbs. As the cloud passed, the daylight suddenly dimmed, making the area look like it was in an eerie twilight.An X user posted, ""Shelf cloud seen moving through the DC area while flash flood, thunderstorm, and tornado warnings were active. The cloud (video below) was filmed in Bowie, Maryland.""According to a report by the Washington Post, tornado, thunderstorm, and flash flood warnings were in effect across parts of the region when the shelf cloud was spotted. While the most intense storms had moved east of the capital by late evening, heavy rain lingered, particularly in and around DC, prompting a flood watch and a severe thunderstorm alert to remain in place for several counties.Meteorologists say shelf clouds are often seen at the leading edge of powerful storm systems. Typically accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning, they serve as visual indicators of potentially dangerous weather.Although shelf clouds themselves are not tornadoes, they often precede conditions conducive to severe thunderstorms or tornadic activity.According to WTOP, the severe thunderstorm watch remained in effect until 9pm, while flood advisories continued late into the night. Local stations also reported temporary ground halts at airports like Reagan National and Dulles, as safety measures were enacted.Local authorities urged residents to remain indoors during the peak of the storm and to exercise caution as downpours may continue into the night, threatening low-lying areas with potential flooding.More severe weather could still be on the cards, as officials monitor the weather conditions. Residents have been advised to stay tuned to local forecasts and emergency alerts.","A video of a huge shelf cloud moving over the Washington DC area has gone viral on social media.

In summary:

Always ask for a MOHRE-approved offer letter.





Verify the offer letter with MOHRE before making travel or visa arrangements.





You are not legally considered an employee until a contract is signed and a work permit is issued.





If your offer is revoked unfairly, you may file a civil case for compensation.









If you’ve received a job offer from a UAE-based company, it's natural to feel excited. But before booking your flight and packing your bags, take a moment to confirm whether the offer is legally valid and enforceable. In the UAE, a signed offer letter between an employer and a prospective employee may be considered an, but not necessarily aIn general legal terms, an agreement (like an offer letter) can be informal, while a contract is a formal agreement enforceable by law. In other words, all contracts are agreements, but not all agreements are contracts.When recruiting in the UAE, employers must issue an official offer letter detailing employment terms and conditions. These terms must then appear identically in the employment contract. The employer and employee may also add more favourable terms for the employee if both agree.This is supported by Article 2(1) of Ministerial Decree No. 46 of 2022 regarding work permits, job offers, and employment contract forms, which states:“Utilise the approved standard employment contract that conforms with the job offer when requesting the issuance of the work permit.It is permissible to add more benefits to the employee in the contract than those mentioned in the job offer; it is also permissible to add annexure to the contract provided that it does not conflict with the provisions of the decree-law and its executive regulations.""An offer letter must follow the format prescribed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE). As per Article 1 of Administrative Resolution No. 38 of 2022, it is mandatory to use the e-forms available on the MOHRE system:""By the guidelines attached herein, electronic forms (e-forms) provided in Mohre system for work permits, offer letters, and employment contracts shall be adopted and implemented.""When applying for a work permit, employers must submit a signed offer letter and other required documents to MOHRE. After approval and payment of the required fees, an official employment contract is created.Before making any commitments, you should contact MOHRE to verify whether the offer letter you’ve received is legitimate and recorded in their system. If your offer letter is not in MOHRE’s approved format, you have the right to request one that is.In some cases, you may also approach the UAE Embassy in your country (such as the UK) for assistance in verifying the authenticity of your job offer, if such services are provided.It’s important to understand that if your prospective employer rescinds the offer letter and you haven’t signed an employment contract or been issued a work permit, MOHRE may not accept your complaint.This is because an employer and employee are only considered parties to an official employment relationship once a valid contract is signed and registered with MOHRE.If the offer is revoked and you suffer monetary loss or damage as a result, you may consider filing a civil case against the prospective employer in a UAE court that has jurisdiction over such matters.This can be pursued under civil liability claims, particularly if you can prove that the employer’s actions led to demonstrable harm such as travel arrangements made in anticipation of employment.Staying vigilant during your job search and relocation process can save you significant hardship later. Always verify first—then move with confidence.","In the UAE, a signed offer letter between an employer and a prospective employee may be considered an, but not necessarily a contract.

From trees to table: Why Bahraini almonds are the talk of the season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/from-trees-to-table-why-bahraini-almonds-are-the-talk-of-the-season/articleshow/122289247.cms,"Local vendors showcase vibrant batches of Bahraini almonds as the summer season officially kicks off, with popular varieties like Habban and Jumbo drawing eager buyers/Image: News of Bahrain





With the arrival of summer and rising temperatures, the much-loved Bahraini almonds are once again appearing on fruit stalls and kitchen tables. Known for their high quality and variety, the local almonds especially the popular ""Habban"" and ""Jumbo"" types are now in season, bringing fresh activity to the markets.These almonds began arriving in the markets just a few days ago, with prices ranging between BD2.5 and BD4 per kilogram depending on size and quality. Premium varieties are even fetching prices as high as BD8.In the coming weeks, two more types: Iskandarani and Jumbo are expected to arrive. Both are known for their large size, excellent taste, and firm texture. Shoppers are eagerly awaiting their return to the shelves.To a local news outlet, vendor Ahmed Abu Karim explained that Habban almonds usually kick off the local almond season and are available for about a month. They come in different colours and sizes, such as yellow-within-red and solid red. Prices depend on the size and overall quality, the larger, high-grade almonds can go up to BD7 per kilo, although most are sold between BD2 and BD4.Abu Karim also noted that the quality and quantity of the crop are heavily influenced by humidity.Higher humidity means better ripening, plumper almonds, and a sweeter taste.He added that after the Habban variety, other types begin to appear, especially the Iskandarani almonds which are known for their rich red interior and delicious flavour and the sought-after Jumbo almonds, priced for their size.Another seller, Qassim Abdullah, pointed out that Habban almonds are well-known in Bahrain and are named for their small, rounded shape resembling a “little seed.”He also mentioned that imported almonds, particularly from Qatif, are becoming more common in local markets and are sold for around BD2 per kilo. However, he believes they can’t compare to Bahraini almonds in terms of sweetness and taste. Qassim also warned that some sellers are misleading customers by marketing imported almonds as local ones, which he considers dishonest and unfair.As the almond season gains momentum, Bahrainis are once again enjoying one of the country’s most beloved summer treats: fresh, local, and full of flavour.","Bahraini almonds are once again appearing on fruit stalls and kitchen tables.

The Gulf is rich with folk tales, some filled with bravery and hardship, others drenched in fear. Saudi YouTuber and indie developer Abdulla Al Hamad turned to the terrifying end of that spectrum for inspiration for his first-person horror game,The game draws from the Emirati jinn legend of, a supernatural entity that lures and kills weak-willed men. In, players enter an empty home haunted by a similar malevolent being. Once inside, they must solve puzzles while evading the creature that lurks in the shadows.Al Hamad says he was intrigued by people’s obsession with fear.“I realised people genuinely enjoy being scared—it’s fun for them,” he told local news outlet“I wanted to create something simple but effective. Horror games don’t require massive development, they require just five or six core mechanics. The rest is all about creativity in the story.”Launched in October 2024,quickly gained traction as regional content creators showcased their playthroughs. It has since reached audiences in East Asia and Turkey, cultures that Al Hamad says share similar folklore roots.Played in first-person, the game immerses players into the shoes of the protagonist exploring what initially seems to be a deserted house. But it becomes clear something sinister is watching. Players must solve puzzles and navigate the space while avoiding the wrath of the ghostly Aunt Fatima.While comparisons have been made toand Hideo Kojima’s, Al Hamad says those weren’t direct influences.“I scare easily, I don’t even watch horror films,” he laughs. “But somehow, I ended up making a horror game.”Instead, his true inspiration came from his own surroundings.He based the haunted house in the game on his grandfather’s home and also visited abandoned areas in Al Khobar, which locals claim are haunted.“For example, the clock that chimes every quarter hour? That’s from my grandfather’s house. The telephone, rugs, bed, and lamps all of them are real details I grew up with,” he said.That authenticity givesa distinct regional identity. One scene even features a(incense burner) on a table, filling the house with aromatic smoke which is an iconic feature in Gulf households.Despite being a solo project,includes over an hour of gameplay and is powered by Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) system. The AI-powered rendering enhances visuals without sacrificing performance, giving the game a polished feel that rivals major studio titles.“To make a horror game work, you need quick reaction time, and DLSS really made that possible,” Al Hamad said.“Seeinglisted on Nvidia’s site next toandmade me incredibly proud.”With Gulf folklore and nostalgic authenticity woven into every shadowed corner,is setting a new standard for regional horror games and is gaining international recognition while doing it.","Saudi YouTuber and indie developer Abdulla Al Hamad turned to the terrifying end of that spectrum for inspiration for his first-person horror game.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
