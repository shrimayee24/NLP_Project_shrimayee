Verdict



Home-grown wearables brand Noise has emerged as one of the major players in the domestic smartwatch market in the past few years. Among one of the biggest smartwatch companies worldwide, Noise offers some most required features at affordable prices in its devices. The company's latest smartwatch is another example of the same.Priced at Rs 6,499, the Noise Origin looks premium and offers useful features. We have been using the Noise Origin smartwatch with leather strap for sometime and here’s what we think:The stainless steel body of the Noise Origin offers it a premium look and feel. The watch has a big circular dial with sleek bezels and a contour cut design all around which gives it a stylish look. While the watch isn’t that bulky, some users may find it uncomfortable to wear it to the bed. The metal body of the watch makes it sturdy and durable for rough usage.The Noise Origin sports two buttons -- a functional crown and a customisable secondary button -- on the right side of the watch. Meanwhile, the sensors and charging magnets are placed below the dial of the smartwatch.The smartwatch comes with two types of straps -- leather and silicone. The leather strap comes in two colours -- Classic Black and Classic Brown -- while the silicone one has three options -- Jet Black, Midnight Black and Silver Grey.We have been using the Classic Black leather strap which felt average in quality and started showing signs of wear a few days after we started reviewing the smartwatch. So, we recommend fitness enthusiasts should go for the silicone straps. These straps are easily interchangeable and Noise offers different types of straps on its official website. Those interested can purchase them separately.The smartwatch is 3ATM water resistant and has an IP68 rating. This means it can be worn to the pool but is not suitable for diving or high-pressure water activities.To test the company’s claims, we used the Noise Origin smartwatch during showers. It caused itching and rashes – something we think is due to the leather strap because we are using another smartwatch with a silicone strap without any skin-related issues.Noise Origin has a 1.46-inch ApexVision AMOLED display which is bright, colourful and snappy. The brightness of the screen doesn’t adjust to the situation but the watch allowed us to select from the five brightness levels available on the quick menu. The highest level is bright enough to make the screen visible in outdoor situations even under direct sunlight.The touch response of the display is very efficient and it worked just fine for us. The display also supports premium features like the Always-on-Display and gesture controls like Raise to Wake and Cover to Sleep which adds to its convenience.The Noise Origin smartwatch features an EN1 processor which offers an impressive performance. Even the Nebula user interface (UI) is smooth and refreshing. We didn't notice any lag or stutter while testing the watch.The crown on the Noise Origin can be used to navigate the menu while the secondary button can be customised for multiple functions. By default, this button opens up the option to activate multiple workout modes supported by the smartwatch.The smartwatch also offers multiple customisation options starting from the menu to watch faces. For the health tracking bit, the smartwatch is somewhat accurate. The step-counting part was on point, however, other features like sleep tracking, heart rate and SpO2 monitoring felt a little hit-or-miss.Noise Origin has a built-in GPS and supports Bluetooth calling . The call quality is good and loud enough in normal conditions such as when using it at home. Having said that, the smartwatch does not perform well in busy surroundings.Noise Origin smartwatch is compatible with the Noise Fit app which can be used to further customise the watch.The battery life on the Noise Origin is quite impressive if you're not using the AoD. With AoD, the watch runs a little more than 2 days, but if you don't have that requirement, it will easily go on for a week. The charger can fully charge the watch in 2 hours.Overall, the Noise Origin smartwatch is a good value for the price point. The smartwatch’s Android-based Nebula processor is smooth and lag-free, and the display is bright as well as colourful. Features like Bluetooth calling and step counting also works fine on the device. So, if you’re looking for a mid-range smartwatch that offers all the required features, the Noise Origin is a good option to consider.",Noise Origin smartwatch has a 1.46-inch ApexVision AMOLED display. The watch is 3ATM water resistant and has an IP68 rating.

Titan submersible's fatal dive: Communication log between vessel and mother ship revealed to be fake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/titan-submersibles-fatal-dive-communication-log-between-vessel-and-mother-ship-revealed-to-be-fake/articleshow/110902938.cms,"NEW DELHI: A shocking revelation has emerged in the investigation into the tragic descent of the Titan submersible towards the Titanic wreckage . The transcript purportedly detailing the communications between the submersible and its mother ship during the fatal journey has been exposed as entirely fabricated, according to Mirror.

Last summer, the release of the communications record stirred widespread concern as it depicted a harrowing sequence of events that turned what was intended as a routine descent into a desperate struggle for survival. The transcript documented the futile attempts of the five passengers to return to the surface amid a series of alarming occurrences.

However, following an exhaustive year-long investigation, the federal investigation team in the United States has confirmed that the transcript is fraudulent. Chairman of the marine board of investigation, Captain Jason D Neubauer, unequivocally said, ""I have no doubt that this transcript is fake. It was made up.""

The investigation failed to uncover any evidence suggesting that the occupants of the Titan were aware of the impending catastrophic implosion that led to their demise. The immense pressure at the depths where the tragedy occurred would have instantly caused the submersible's hull to disintegrate, rendering any attempts at communication futile.

The fabricated transcript , which surfaced in late June, appeared to feature minute-by-minute conversations laden with technical jargon and accurate descriptions, creating an illusion of authenticity. The document portrayed the Titan's crew in a state of panic as they grappled with hull alarms and ominous cracking sounds before communication abruptly ceased.

One focal point of the phony transcript was the Real Time Hull Health Monitoring system (RTM), a proprietary device designed by OceanGate to assess the integrity of the submersible's hull during dives. The fictitious communications detailed multiple hull alarms and crackling sounds, culminating in an ominous message indicating an ""RTM alert active all red.""

Former Navy submariner and submersible pilot, Dr Alfred S McLaren, initially found the transcript plausible but later speculated that it may have been concocted to tarnish OceanGate's reputation or inflict further distress upon the families of the victims.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Apple unveiled its new artificial intelligence (AI) system, but with a twist. Instead of the industry-standard term, Apple has opted to call it “Apple Intelligence.” Company CEO Tim Cook has downplayed any hidden meaning behind the name choice, saying that the company is calling it what it is.“It seemed sort of a logical conclusion after looking at so many names. At least for me, I can tell you it wasn’t a riff off of artificial intelligence. It was sort of calling it what it is. I’m sure a lot will be said about it, but it’s probably not as it appears,” Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post, when asked why the company chose Apple Intelligence over the conventional term.Apple unveiled its AI system, Apple Intelligence, integrating machine learning models designed for everyday tasks across iPhones, iPads and Macs. The AI system leverages Apple silicon for functions like understanding and generating language, taking action across apps and personalising user experiences – all with keeping privacy as a core focus.For this, Apple collaborated with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and also announced that it will bring the free version of the app as opt-in. Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi , also said that the company may work with more models, like Google Gemini , in the future.When asked whether Apple can stop AI hallucinations – a term used for responses generated by AI chatbots that are incorrect or misleading but presented in a very confident manner – Cook said that Apple Intelligence may produce false information.“It’s not 100 percent. But I think we have done everything that we know to do, including thinking very deeply about the readiness of the technology in the areas that we’re using it in. So I am confident it will be very high quality. But I’d say in all honesty that’s short of 100 percent. I would never claim that it’s 100 percent,” Cook said.On the most immediate Ai benefits for Apple customers, Cook said that “they’re going to save time and that “things are going to become more efficient [for them].”","Apple unveiled its new artificial intelligence (AI) system, but with a twist.

In a series of posts and replies on X, formerly Twitter, Musk lambasted Apple for partnering with OpenAI.Musk slammed the integration of ChatGPT in iPhones and other Apple devices, calling it ""unacceptable security violation"". Warning iPhone and other Apple device users, Musk said, “Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI.

While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs.

Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
