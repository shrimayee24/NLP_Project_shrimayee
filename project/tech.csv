What Wisconsin shooter Natalie Rupnow wrote in her 'War against Humanity' manifesto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-shooter-war-against-humanity/articleshow/116407685.cms,"The Wisconsin shooter wrote her grievances in an alleged manifesto titled 'War against Humanity'

Content of the Manifesto



Familial and Social Alienation: Rupnow described a profound sense of emotional neglect and rejection from her family, writing that her parents viewed her as a “mistake they never wanted.” She portrayed herself as an outsider both at home and at school, writing, “They look at me but don’t see me. I am invisible until I do something they can’t ignore.” Rupnow's resentment toward her classmates was equally evident; she accused peers of ridiculing her differences and isolating her further, describing them as “part of the disease called humanity.”

She criticized societal expectations, consumerism, and what she called “false morality,” blaming humanity for creating a world of cruelty, hypocrisy, and exploitation. She referred to herself as “a soldier against the plague of mankind.”

She criticized societal expectations, consumerism, and what she called “false morality,” blaming humanity for creating a world of cruelty, hypocrisy, and exploitation. She referred to herself as “a soldier against the plague of mankind.” Retribution and Power: Rupnow justified her actions as a “final statement” against a world that she believed had failed her. She wrote, “If the world doesn’t care that I exist, it will care when I don’t.” The shooting, according to her writings, was an attempt to reclaim control over her life, which she described as dominated by feelings of powerlessness.

She wrote, “If the world doesn’t care that I exist, it will care when I don’t.” The shooting, according to her writings, was an attempt to reclaim control over her life, which she described as dominated by feelings of powerlessness. Suicidal Ideation with a Twist: While Rupnow had contemplated suicide for years, she expressed a desire to make her death “mean something.” She rejected the idea of dying quietly and wrote, “A life wasted in silence is a death that changes nothing. I want them to remember me, to feel what I felt.”

Social Media Activity and Warnings



Disturbing Content: Over the months leading up to the attack, her posts increasingly featured themes of death, revenge, and societal collapse. Images of firearms, violent memes, and nihilistic quotes were frequent. She shared captions like “The quiet ones always strike the loudest” and “I’m not broken—I’m what you made me.”

She shared captions like “The quiet ones always strike the loudest” and “I’m not broken—I’m what you made me.” Manifesto Teasers: Investigators have noted that Rupnow dropped hints about her manifesto in cryptic posts. Phrases like “The countdown has begun” and “They’ll know what I mean when the time comes” appeared shortly before the attack. These posts, while ominous in retrospect, were largely dismissed at the time as dark teenage musings.

She often posted about feeling unseen and unheard, writing, “I am a shadow, but I will make them see.” Friends and followers reportedly noticed a shift in her tone weeks before the attack, describing her posts as “angrier and colder than usual.”

Manifesto Insights: Her Motivations



Feelings of Rejection: Her sense of alienation—both at home and in school—formed the core of her bitterness. She wrote of being unloved, unseen, and unwanted.

Red Flags and Missed Warnings



The Aftermath



In the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin , a disturbing document titled ""War Against Humanity"" has emerged, reportedly authored by 15-year-old Natalie ""Samantha"" Rupnow. This alleged manifesto, along with evidence from her social media activity and personal writings, sheds light on her motivations, mental state, and the warning signs that went unnoticed in the lead-up to the attack.The alleged ""War Against Humanity"" manifesto is an unsettling, multi-page document filled with grievances, dark reflections, and ominous declarations. The manifesto reveals not only deep personal struggles but also a deliberate and premeditated justification for her violent actions.Rupnow’s social media presence painted a chilling picture of her mindset leading up to the shooting. Her accounts, mostly private or pseudonymous, were littered with troubling posts, dark imagery, and cryptic messages that hinted at her escalating despair.Rupnow’s writings, paired with her online behavior, point to a toxic mix of personal grievances, anger, and existential despair that fueled her actions:In hindsight, the warning signs were clear but tragically ignored. Her dark and violent social media posts, cryptic writings, and noticeable changes in behavior were dismissed by friends and family as teenage angst. Investigators are examining whether anyone knew of Rupnow’s plans and failed to report her behavior. School officials and counselors have since been criticized for failing to identify her struggles. Peers who were aware of her disturbing posts reportedly felt uncomfortable but did not raise concerns.As the Madison community mourns the devastating loss of life, the “War Against Humanity” manifesto serves as a stark reminder of the importance of recognizing warning signs and addressing teenage mental health struggles. Rupnow’s writings and actions underscore the consequences of unchecked isolation, unaddressed trauma, and a failure to intervene when red flags emerge. Law enforcement and educators have called for greater awareness of social media behaviors, urging families to pay closer attention to troubling content and shifts in emotional well-being. The investigation continues, but the tragedy has left a haunting question: How could these signs have been missed, and what more could have been done to prevent such unthinkable violence?","Rupnow described a profound sense of emotional neglect and rejection from her family, writing that her parents viewed her as a “mistake they never wanted” She portrayed herself as an outsider both at home and at school, writing, “They look at me but don’t see me.” Rupnow's resentment toward her classmates was equally evident; she accused peers of ridiculing her differences and isolating her further, describing them as “part of the disease called humanity”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116407871,imgsize-1373840,width-400,resizemode-4/116407871.jpg"
Travis Hunter sparks buzz with cryptic post featuring fiancée Leanna Lenne amid ongoing controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunter-sparks-buzz-with-cryptic-post-featuring-fiance-leanna-lenne-amid-ongoing-controversy/articleshow/116438982.cms,"Credits: Instagram

Travis Hunter's instagram post featuring fiancée Leanna Lenne sends subtle message amid relationship rumors



Travis Hunter , the famed 2024 Heisman Trophy winner and Colorado Buffaloes standout, recently took to Instagram to show off his fiancée, Leanna Lenee , in an elaborately post that said quite a lot without saying very much. In that post, he hailed his fiancée, Leanna Lenee, in a very beautiful yet understated way. Lenee stood out in a light yellow dress, but it was her radiance that shone through more. Hunter broke the silence with very few, but strong, actions amidst the ongoing scrutiny.This weekend, the darling couple found themselves in the social media spotlight after an incident at the Heisman Trophy event. Hunter celebrated one of college football's proudest accolades as his significant other bore hearsay online about her reactions during the ceremony itself. So intense were the barbs that they led her to make her Instagram account private as trolls speculated about what kind of fish someone like her caught with a guy like him.Even with everything going south, both Hunter and Lenee have decided to remain together and publicly address the drama. On Monday, Lenee posted an eight-minute long TikTok sharing all the stories from that event, clearing up misunderstanding regarding her personality and relations with Hunter. The same day, Hunter went on to defend Lenee very much on his Twitch live stream from detractors with bogus criticisms about her.“You ain’t never had no girl, so why are y’all talking about me?” Hunter remarked during his stream. His frustration was palpable as he continued, “Find someone else to talk about. Go talk about your girl. Go find a girl. Go find a life. Stop worrying about what I got going on. I know what I got.”Hunter also issued a stern warning to those perpetuating false narratives, emphasizing, “Y’all better stop. I ain’t playing.” His words made it evident that he wasn’t willing to let the noise interfere with their long-standing relationship.Hunter somehow put a stop to the critics with his silence, as he posted a wordless image of Lenee appearing stunning in her yellow dress on Instagram on Tuesday. Comments were disabled on the post, allowing my actions to speak for themselves. I added the only caption in a crying-laughing emoji, but the music choice really says it all. Hunter captured the photo with Mindless Behavior's ""Christmas with My Girl,"" lyrics ""All I want for Christmas is my girl"" embodying the very defiance and loyalty in his attitude.Also Read: Travis Hunter’s fiancée explains why she ignored his DMs for two months and clarifies she is not with Travis for fame Hunter and Lenee have been in a relationship for five years now, and they announced their engagement in February 2024. The couple plans to get married on May 2025, a date that might also coincide with the NFL rookie minicamp, considering that Hunter chooses to declare for the draft.","Travis Hunter, the famed 2024 Heisman Trophy winner and Colorado Buffaloes standout, recently took to Instagram to show off his fiancée, Leanna Lenee.

A sudden water leak in the cabin had flyers fearing they might ""drown"" at 30,000 feet above ground.The unexpected flooding began when a leak in a rear restroom sent water streaming down the aisle toward the front of the plane, as per the New York Post. Hilary Stewart Blazevic, a passenger, told Storyful that a woman alerted a flight attendant about the leak after using the restroom. The crew failed to stop the leakage despite their best efforts.“It was utter disbelief and a little panic,” Blazevic recounted, explaining how passengers scrambled to lift their feet and belongings out of the “disgusting” water pooling on the floor.A viral TikTok video, which has now garnered over 7.2 million views, captured the chaos onboard. The clip, humorously set to Céline Dion’s My heart will go on, the theme song from the 1997 Titanic film — showed panicked passengers trying to escape the gush. A content creator even quipped in the video caption, “The in-flight movie was Titanic.”Comments flooded in online, with many likening the ordeal to a scene from the Final Destination franchise. “Imagine drowning…on a plane…in the air,” one user wrote. Another added, “New final destination fear unlocked.”While the incident was unnerving, it wasn’t the only frightening event for flyers in recent months. In September, an Avianca Airlines flight to Colombia faced severe turbulence that left passengers gripping their seats and praying.","A sudden water leak in the cabin had flyers fearing they might ""drown"" at 30,000 feet above ground.

Is Netflix over Harry and Meghan? 'Exhausted' execs pin hopes on Sussexes’ cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/is-netflix-over-harry-and-meghan-exhausted-execs-pin-hopes-on-sussexes-cookery-show/articleshow/116359484.cms,"As per the sources, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle.

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

Why has Canada banned balloon-blowing kits sold on Amazon?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-has-canada-banned-balloon-blowing-kits-sold-on-amazon/articleshow/116410742.cms,"Health concerns

What are balloon blowing kits?

Canada has recently issued a warning asking citizens to abstain from using balloon-blowing kits sold on Amazon as they possess a chemical hazard.“Immediately stop using the affected products and dispose of them according to municipal hazardous waste guidelines,” the health agency cautioned in its advisory released on December 13.The advisory covers several products like a 15 pieces bubble ball toy, burst-free plastic balloon, colorful magic bubble glue, perfect boys and girls gift 202 and others.Health Canada has also stated that Amazon sold 127 units of the affected products in the country between November 2023 and November 2024. As of now, no incidents or injuries related to these products have been reported.The authority revealed that blowing the balloons exposes a child to inhaling the vapours of any solvents present.“If children blow this type of solvent-containing balloon for extended periods, they may experience early symptoms of central nervous system depression or dysfunction, including euphoria, hallucinations, dizziness, and difficulties with co-ordination of voluntary movements,” it further added, “Prolonged exposure can lead to more serious symptoms, including muscular twitching, unconsciousness and coma.”Balloon blowing kits are toys that come with a tube of solvent mixture and short plastic straws. Kids use these straws to create bubbles or balloons by squeezing a small amount of the mixture onto the end of the straw and then blowing through it. The air from the straw forms a bubble, making it a fun activity for children.Previously, the country also issued advisories against these balloon-blowing kits sold via AliExpress.ca, eBay.ca and SHEIN.","Health Canada has issued a warning asking citizens to abstain from using balloon-blowing kits sold on Amazon as they possess a chemical hazard.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the US on Jan 1. It means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E C Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip ""Thimble Theater"" in 1929. The supposed one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed ""Popeye"".But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength was not there from the start, and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does 1980 film starring Robin Williams.That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's ""Adventures of Tintin"" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herge, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle, and became a weekly feature. The comic also first appeared in the US in 1929. Its signature bright colours - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes. And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.The books becoming public this year read like syllabus for an American literature seminar. William Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury"", Ernest Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" and John Steinbeck's first novel ""A Cup of Gold"" will also enter the public domain.","Popeye and Tintin are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the US on Jan 1.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme. In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Imagine this:

You get an unexpected call from a courier company. The representative tells you that the police have held a parcel of yours because it has drugs and other illegal items. They even disclose some personal details, like your Aadhaar number, etc. Soon, you'll also get calls from police, CBI, etc.

This is the beginning of courier scams that have just exploded in recent years. These scams are so realistic that most of us would probably fall for them regardless of how smart we are because they take advantage of our fears.

Every day, hundreds of people lose lakhs of their hard-earned money to these scams. Recently, the Zero1 team spoke to an actual scammer and recorded the call to break down and explain how this scam works. Watch it and share it with your friends and family.

Staying safe from scams:

Never share personal or financial information over unsolicited calls or video calls.

Government agencies and banks will never contact you via social media platforms for financial investigations.

Be wary of callers who create a sense of urgency or fear.

If unsure about a call, end it and contact the relevant authorities directly using phone numbers obtained from official websites.

Always discuss suspicious communications with family members or trusted friends.
