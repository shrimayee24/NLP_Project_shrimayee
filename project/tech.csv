Travis interrupts her and talks about how Leanna had told him about her own experience in college where she would party and have fun so she wanted Travis also to have the same experience. Leanna can be heard saying the back then she had told Travis, ‚ÄúGo to college, go do your thing.‚ÄùIt is evident that Leanna did not want to be cheated upon when Travis was in college but also did not want to hold him back from having fun in college. Travis also speaks about how at one point Leanna told him to ‚ÄúGo do your thing and leave me alone.‚Äù Leanna also talks about how once she had this conversation with Travis and Travis refused to end the relationship, now he could not ‚Äúbacktrack‚Äù even if he wanted to.While this might seem like a sweet video where they speak about the boundaries of their relationship during their initial days of dating, this video did not go down well with the fans of Travis. Many users slammed Leanna for her opinions and how cheating is so normalised in their relationship. An user wrote on X, ‚ÄúDump her please bro I‚Äôve had enough of these videos, telling u in front of your face she not good for you. Wake up all the signs are there, don‚Äôt find out the hard way this is a total distraction from your career. I promise you this.‚ÄùOther users took to X and wrote, ‚ÄúThis girl is bad news. Clear as day.‚Äù Many users again questioned Leanna‚Äôs ‚Äúintentions‚Äù with him as an user wrote, ‚ÄúReminder to everyone with a boyfriend or girlfriend you always have the option to break up with them.""The hate and trolling has forced Leanna to make her social media accounts private. She has issued a statement where she has spoken about how she is with Travis due to the person he is and not because of his popularity or money, but people continue to question her. The constant hate has also forced Travis to delete his Instagram account.Also Read: Josh Allen receives a $50,000 MVP necklace from the Buffalo Bills' offense line, but fans aren't impressed with the lavish gift","An old video of the couple has now gone viral where they are discussing about how they had to talk about their relationship when Travis decided to go to college.

Traveling to foreign countries often reveals stark cultural differences; behaviors considered normal in one place can appear unconventional or even inappropriate in another. This was the case on a Finland train when an NRI got annoyed by a ‚Äòloud‚Äô Indian family on an otherwise quiet train.A user, Gokul Sridhar(@gokul), shared a tweet about his experience in a train compartment which he shared with people including an Indian family. Gokul described the carriage as ""extremely quiet"" until the family began speaking loudly in Hindi and leaving their cabin doors open. He expressed his frustration, remarking that Indians often lack "" civic sense .""He posted, ‚ÄúI'm on a train from Lapland to Helsinki and there's one family in the otherwise ULTRA QUIET carriage that's being very loud, talking to someone over a video call. In Hindi. With their cabin doors open. We REALLY don't get civic sense, do we?‚Äù He further added that ironically this incident happened right when he was watching a video that explained that talking loudly in trains is frowned upon in Japan as it is considered bad manners.If Sridhar thought that he had to bear the family only for the duration of the train, he was wrong. He updated in the comment section of his post that he somehow ended up in the same restaurant as the family who were again talking to someone loudly and that too without headphones. An X user advised Sridhar, ‚ÄúEasier to stop by and request them to close the door and lower their voice?‚Äù To which he retorts, ‚ÄúYup I'm gonna do that but there shouldn't even be a need for this, is my point.‚ÄùThe post has since received more than 12k views and the comment section has divided reaction to this. A user sharing his own experience said, ‚ÄúSame in Manc. I'm on a train to London on the quiet coach trying to get some sleep. Guess who's talking on their phone loudly in the QUIET COACH‚ÄùHowever, some sympathetic users asked Sridhar to tell them instead of complaining about them on social media. One user said, ‚ÄúAnd you chose to post on X rather than educating them to be quiet. Might be their first time on foreign land and out of excitement.. as a concerned Indian you must have told them the etiquettes politely.. posting on X will not improve the situation.‚ÄùThe incident reignited discussions about public behavior and cultural differences , as it highlighted the challenges of navigating diverse social norms in shared spaces. Some argue that cultural awareness and sensitivity are essential to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, especially in multicultural environments. The clash on the Finland train serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting local customs and behaviors, while also fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and tolerance. This incident underscores the need for travelers to be mindful of their actions and consider how they may be perceived by others in different cultural contexts, promoting harmony and understanding.","Gokul Sridhar shared a tweet about his experience in a train compartment which he shared with people including an Indian family.

He appeared on the 4th&1 podcast and revealed how he knew the college football star, Travis Hunter of the Colorado Buffaloes would be winning the Heisman Trophy this year, the moment he entered the venue. The reason behind this is the seating arrangement; he recalled the day he had won the Heisman Trophy in 2010 and he along with his family were sitting in the front row at the venue, just like Travis did this year.Cam said, ‚ÄúI knew Travis won the Heisman by merely walking into the auditorium.

A new internet law that gives the Vietnamese government expanded powers over internet services and people using them is set to officially take effect Wednesday.Decree 147 expands government control over access to information on the internet for reasons of ""national security"" and ""social order.""The law requires social media platforms providing services to users in Vietnam to store user data and provide it to authorities on demand.The government issued the decree this November, and it requires organizations to take down anything the authorities consider ""illegal content"" within 24 hours.Decree 147 has sparked concerns, with researchers and experts tracking the country saying that the law is part of a growing crackdown on civil society.""Because the Vietnamese police treat any criticism of the Communist Party of Vietnam as a national security matter, this decree will provide them with yet another tool to suppress dissent,"" said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch.The decree requires tech giants like Facebook and TikTok among other organizations, to verify user accounts using people's phone numbers or personal identification numbers. It requires companies to store that data.Decree 147 also requires organizations to provide search and content-scanning tools to government authorities upon request.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham‚Äôs temperature as ‚Äúbalmy,‚Äù saying, ‚ÄúThe corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.‚ÄùGuests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as ‚Äúso compact.‚ÄùIn Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a ‚Äúpeaceful and happy new life.‚Äù Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like a big family like I always wanted,‚Äù she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‚ÄòNo boisterous behavior‚Äô

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions ‚Äúclaustrophobic.‚ÄùSpeaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. ‚ÄúDiana hated Sandringham,‚Äù Seward said. ‚ÄúEven when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶ I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn‚Äôt want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they‚Äôre not rules. They‚Äôre just traditions of royalty.‚Äù Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana‚Äôs experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.‚ÄúIt was highly fraught,‚Äù Diana told Morton. ‚ÄúI know I gave, but I can‚Äôt remember being a receiver. Isn‚Äôt that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.‚Äù Diana added, ‚ÄúI sure was [an outsider].‚ÄùSeward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana‚Äôs disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. ‚ÄúShe just couldn‚Äôt understand [it],‚Äù Seward said. ‚ÄúTo her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.‚ÄùDespite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana ‚Äúhated going to Sandringham for Christmas,‚Äù mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen‚Äôs Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a ‚Äúcommand performance.‚Äù An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana‚Äôs experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana‚Äôs gift-giving experience was ‚Äúembarrassing and painful,‚Äù as she wasn‚Äôt aware of the family‚Äôs gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange ‚Äúsilly joke presents,‚Äù with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles‚Äô favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

While the general consensus on AI ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù ‚Äì the generation of plausible but false information ‚Äì are concerning, scientists are increasingly recognising their potential for driving innovation and discovery, report has said, adding that these unexpected outputs from AI models are proving surprisingly useful in fields ranging from medicine to climate science.According to a report in The New York Times, AI hallucinations, or inaccurate or misleading outputs can spark new ideas and accelerate the scientific process. AI hallucinations arise when generative models are trained on a specific subject and then allowed to rework that information, sometimes producing unexpected and even surreal results.‚ÄúThe public thinks it's all bad. But it's actually giving scientists new ideas. It's giving them the chance to explore ideas they might not have thought about otherwise,‚Äù Amy McGovern, a computer scientist and director of a federal AI institute, was quoted as saying.According to the scientists, this ‚Äòcreative aspect‚Äô of AI is proving valuable particularly in the early stages of scientific discovery , where hunches and guesswork often play a crucial role. AI hallucinations can speed up the process of generating and testing hypotheses, leading to faster breakthroughs.James J. Collins, an MIT professor, recently praised AI hallucinations for accelerating his research into novel antibiotics.‚ÄúWe're exploring. We're asking the models to come up with completely new molecules,‚Äù he said.The impact of AI hallucinations is evident in the work of Nobel laureate David Baker, who shared the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on proteins. Baker credited AI hallucinations with helping his lab design millions of brand-new proteins not found in nature, leading to numerous patents and the founding of over 20 biotech companies .","AI hallucinations arise when generative models are trained on a specific subject and then allowed to rework that information, sometimes producing unexpected and even surreal results.

As post on Uber charging different from iPhone and Android users go viral; company clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-post-on-uber-charging-different-from-iphone-and-android-users-go-viral-company-clarifies/articleshow/116652498.cms,"Read the LinkedIn post here



A colleague recently booked an Uber ride on two different phones simultaneously, from the same pick-up point to the same drop-off point. üöóüì±

He wanted to improve his chances of getting a ride during peak hours.

- On Android, the fare was ‚Çπ290.79.

- On iPhone, the fare was ‚Çπ342.47.

What‚Äôs going on here?

This isn‚Äôt a glitch‚Äîit‚Äôs design thinking in action, driven by data and user insights:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User Behaviour: iPhone users are often perceived as ‚Äúpremium customers‚Äù‚Äîdata shows they‚Äôre more willing to pay higher prices.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Platform Fees: Apple charges up to 30% commission on in-app purchases, subtly influencing pricing decisions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Personalisation: Apps increasingly use

dynamic pricing

based on user behaviour and profiles. Your choice of device could impact what you‚Äôre charged.

Here‚Äôs the real question:

When does personalisation improve user experience, and when does it start to feel exploitative?

From a design thinking perspective, this approach is rooted in understanding user behaviour and adapting to it.

For businesses, it‚Äôs smart‚Äîleveraging data to optimise value.

For users, it‚Äôs complicated‚Äîdoes this pricing strategy enhance the experience, or does it break trust?

What we found out in our testing

What Uber has to say

A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate. The post, which quickly went viral, showed screenshots of two phones displaying significantly different fares for the same ride. The post ignited speculation among users, with many questioning whether Uber's pricing algorithm discriminates based on the type of device used.Nirali Parekh shared her colleague's experience of booking an Uber in a LinkedIn post. In the post, she highlighted the significant price difference for the same trip when booked using an Android smartphone versus an iPhone.The same post was shared by the Uber user on X (formerly known as Twitter). ‚ÄúSame pickup point, destination & time but 2 different phones get 2 different rates. It happens with me as I always get higher rates on my Uber as compared to my daughter‚Äôs phone. So most of the time, I request her to book my Uber. Does this happen with you also? What is the hack?,‚Äù posted Sudhir on X.To investigate these claims, TOI Tech conducted its own tests. We booked multiple Uber rides using various devices, including budget-friendly Android phones and premium Apple iPhones. However, we did not observe any significant price variations across different devices or locations.Uber quickly responded to the allegations, stating that the observed fare differences were not due to the type of phone used. ""Hi there, multiple differences in these two rides impact the prices. The pick-up point, ETA, and drop-off point on these requests vary, which will cause different fares. Uber does not personalize trip pricing based on a rider's cell phone manufacturer,"" the company explained.","A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate.
