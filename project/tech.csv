Poll Do you support the Supreme Court's ruling allowing minors to challenge property sales by guardians? Yes, it's a fair decision. No, it could lead to confusion.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that minors can challenge any property sale or transfer done by their parents or guardians without a lawsuit, after turning 18.The court said adults can cancel such transfers by taking clear actions, like selling or transferring the property themselves.""It can safely be concluded that a voidable transaction executed by the guardian of the minor can be repudiated and ignored by the minor within time on attaining majority either by instituting a suit for setting aside the voidable transaction or by repudiating the same by his unequivocal conduct,"" Justice Mithal, authoring the judgment, said.The verdict came in K S Shivappa vs Smt K Neelamma case. The case involved two plots in Shamanur village, Karnataka, bought in 1971 by Rudrappa in the names of his three minor sons.Rudrappa sold the plots without court permission. After the sons became adults, they sold the plots to K S Shivappa. Third parties who had bought the plots earlier claimed ownership, leading to disputes.Lower courts were divided on whether the minors needed to file a suit to cancel the original sale. The Supreme Court clarified that a formal suit is not needed. Adults can repudiate the guardian’s sale by acting clearly, such as selling the property themselves.The court added that sometimes, minors may not even know about the original sale, or the property may still be in their possession, so filing a suit is not always necessary.","The verdict came in K S Shivappa vs Smt K Neelamma case.

NEW DELHI: A video circulating on social media captures a chaotic scene at IIT Guwahati, where a Diwali celebration turned into a fiery exchange of crackers between students.What began as festive fun quickly escalated into a dangerous “firecracker war” between residents of the Barak and Umiam hostels, forcing police to intervene.In the viral clip, students can be seen launching rockets and bursting crackers at each other from across hostel buildings, lighting up the campus sky in a chaotic display.The noise and intensity of the fireworks made the area resemble a battlefield more than a festival ground.A user on X shared the video with the caption, “This video is allegedly from IIT Guwahati, where a Diwali firecracker war broke out among the ‘most talented’ students of India.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Marc Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The job cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Marc Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch. He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

What’s the buzz about the Orionid Meteor shower?

Best time across the US

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

Watch: Louvre Jewels Stolen In Seconds: Thief Caught On Camera





New footage has emerged showing the thieves who stole $100 million worth of jewels from the Louvre making a slow getaway in broad daylight in front of French peopleThe video shows two men — one wearing a neon vest and another in a motorcycle helmet — in the basket of a lift, slowly lowering to the ground from the world-famous museum in Paris, where they successfully pulled off the 7-minute heist.They appear in no rush, calmly reaching the ground on a construction lift attached to a stolen truck. Once they reached the ground, the men disappeared from view before police said they escaped on motorised scooters.The footage has gone viral on social media. It appears to have been filmed from inside the Louvre overlooking the Seine on Sunday, according to the Telegraph.French authorities are hunting four suspects in the robbery, which seems like something out of a Netflix series. The group reportedly parked a stolen truck outside the museum and used a construction lift to reach a second-floor window. They cut through the glass with an angle grinder before entering the Apollo Gallery. The alarm was triggered, but only reached guards focused on visitor safety.Inside the museum, another video shows the thieves casually cutting through a glass case while stunned guests looked on. They tried to set fire to their mobile ladder before fleeing, but failed. Furthermore, the burglars accidentally dropped an emerald-set imperial crown containing more than 1,300 diamonds that belonged to Empress Eugenie.The robbers abandoned the truck and its keys before escaping. A motorcycle helmet and a glove belonging to one of the criminals were recovered, but none of the suspects has been identified so far, authorities told Le Parisien.","Video shows two men slowly lowering to the ground from the world-famous museum in Paris.

Emarat Al Youm

“With the start of every school year, rumors and false news spread on social media claiming that red pills are spreading in schools.

I emphasize the inaccuracy of these claims and reassure parents and members of the public that such pills are not present in our schools or universities.”

“Thanks to the support of its wise leadership, the UAE has attained a significant global standing. It is only natural that it has many enemies, and there are electronic committees that promote such lies to destabilize public opinion.”

Protecting youth: UAE’s vigilance against hidden substance threats









Abu Dhabi Police have firmly dismissed circulating social media rumours about so-called “red pills” being distributed in schools and universities, reinforcing the importance of verified information and community vigilance. The denial comes as authorities continue to strengthen digital and physical security awareness across the UAE.Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Abu Dhabi Police General Command, confirmed that reports of red pills in educational institutions are entirely baseless, according to. He stated,Al Dhaheri further highlighted the broader context, noting,He emphasized the critical need to rely on official sources, adding that Abu Dhabi Police maintain transparency and trust in their public engagement and “never hide anything” from the community.Abu Dhabi Police maintain a continuous presence in schools, universities, and community spaces, engaging with students, parents, and other stakeholders to raise awareness on a wide range of issues—from crime prevention and digital safety to substance abuse and child protection. These programmes regularly involve visits to campuses, community councils, and public forums, emphasizing practical guidance on safeguarding personal, financial, and social wellbeing.An example of such efforts is the ongoing sixth edition of the “Be Cautious” campaign, a three-month initiative organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, other police departments, the UAE Cybersecurity Council, Abu Dhabi Media, First Abu Dhabi Bank, and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. The campaign highlights emerging online fraud methods, such as phishing links, misleading phone calls, fake prize notifications, and fraudulent e-commerce sites, while also reinforcing broader messages of vigilance and responsible behaviour in everyday life.Events and educational programmes are conducted across social and traditional media, community councils, universities, and schools, ensuring that all segments of society are informed. Brigadier Al Dhaheri emphasized stakeholder collaboration as a key factor in maximizing outreach and public impact.The handling of such rumours is supported by the Federal Decree-Law No. 55 of 2023 on Media Regulation, which organizes the media activities of individuals, organizations, media outlets, and free zones dedicated to media in the UAE. According to the decree:Crucially, the law prohibits:Violations can result in administrative fines, closure of the media institution, or cancellation of media licenses, underscoring the UAE’s zero-tolerance approach to misinformation.Federal Decree-Law No. 34 of 2021 on Combatting Rumors and Cybercrimes, along with other applicable laws protecting privacy, reputation, and preventing defamation, also apply to social media use. Citizens and residents in the UAE need to be aware of the provisions of these laws, which clearly spell out actions that could constitute a criminal offence.The “red pills” rumours are particularly alarming because adolescents and young adults are at a stage of exploration and identity formation, which can increase their vulnerability to substance use. However, the UAE maintains some of the world’s strictest anti-drug laws, ensuring that such threats are promptly addressed. Authorities are calling on families, schools, and universities to strengthen cooperation in protecting youth from such hidden dangers. Parents are urged to pay attention to where their children go, who they befriend, and what they bring home.Recent investigations have uncovered sophisticated new tactics used by drug traffickers to smuggle toxic substances into the local market, employing methods so deceptive that the items appear harmless to the unsuspecting eye. Officials report that traffickers are increasingly camouflaging these substances as everyday products that young people often use or consume, such as energy drinks, chewing gum, or even flavoured paper, highlighting the importance of vigilance and community awareness.",Abu Dhabi Police have firmly dismissed circulating social media rumours about so-called “red pills” being distributed in schools and universities.

Registration process and criteria

Bottom line





The UAE’s General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat has reported a historic surge in Hajj 2026 applications, with approximately 72,000 residents applying for a quota of just 6,228 pilgrims. This unprecedented number of applicants marks one of the highest submission rates in recent years and demonstrates the enduring spiritual significance of the pilgrimage for Emiratis.The spiritual call to perform Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, has drawn unprecedented demand in the UAE for the upcoming 2026 (1447 AH) season. The General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat (Awqaf) confirmed that approximately 72,000 applicants submitted their requests. This colossal number is competing for an official national quota set by Saudi Arabia: just 6,228 spots.This intense competition means the odds of selection are approximately 1 in 11.5. The registration window, which ran from September 24 to October 9, 2025, saw the demand surge digitally through Awqaf's smart app and official website. Authorities have begun the rigorous process of granting preliminary approvals, with final selection adhering strictly to the governance set by the Cabinet Resolution No.(32) of 2018.The UAE uses a lottery-based selection system to manage oversubscription fairly:This system ensures no bias in selection and gives all qualified applicants a fair chance, despite the record-breaking demand.Applicants can quickly check their selection status using the official UAE channels:Tip: Only applicants with confirmed notifications should proceed with travel arrangements and payments.

The entire process from registration to initial approval was conducted online. This early opening of registration months in advance is a key strategy to enhance efficiency and streamline services for the selected pilgrims.A core principle guiding the selection process is fairness, specifically prioritizing those who are undertaking the pilgrimage for the first time. The electronic system is designed to give preference to Emirati citizens who have not yet performed Hajj, ensuring that as many people as possible get the chance to fulfill this once-in-a-lifetime religious duty. Once preliminary approval is granted, applicants are contacted via their registered phone numbers and must strictly adhere to deadlines to finalize all necessary permits and procedures. Furthermore, the authorities have implemented a new, stricter accreditation system for Hajj campaign operators, focusing on vetting travel agencies for their service quality, financial stability, and track record.Registration for Hajj 2026 was conducted through the Authority’s official channels, including its smart app and website, with a deadline of October 9, 2025.

Special mention - Purple roof

Hala taxi: The digital booking revolution

Fare uniformity across colours

Why Dubai taxi ’s colour system works?





Dubai’s public transportation is renowned globally for its sophistication and user-friendly approach. Among its numerous transit options, the taxi network stands out for its unique feature - brightly coloured roofs. These colours are not mere aesthetics but represent different taxi operators under the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), ensuring order in one of the world’s busiest taxi fleets. With over 12,000 taxis plying the city’s streets, understanding this colour code is essential for residents and visitors alike.Dubai’s taxi roof colour scheme was introduced in the late 2000s as a strategic move to unify and brand the city's taxi services. Previously, taxis were inconsistent in appearance and service quality, causing passenger confusion. Today, every taxi sports a uniform sand-coloured body, with the only visual differentiation on the roof. This system makes it easy for passengers to identify the operator, report lost items, and recognize the taxi’s route and purpose. Despite differing colours, all taxis operate under RTA regulations, guaranteeing consistent fares and safety standards.The coloured roofs correspond to specific taxi companies, each with distinct fleet sizes, service areas, and commitments to technology or sustainability.Though not widespread, purple roofs belong to Kabi Taxi, Dubai’s newest company focusing on modernity and practicality in their smaller fleet.Introduced in 2019 as a partnership between the RTA and ride-hailing giant Careem, Hala Taxi is a digital booking platform that connects passengers to the nearest available RTA-approved taxi, regardless of roof colour. This 24/7 service offers real-time tracking, seamless cashless payments, and convenience for riders. A ride booked via Hala Taxi typically starts at around AED 12, with fares regulated by the RTA to maintain consistency.Importantly, the colourful roofs do not affect the fare. All taxis follow the RTA’s standardized fare structure, which includes base fare, per kilometre charges, and waiting time costs that are consistent citywide. Any price differences generally come from booking platform service fees or minimum fare thresholds but never from the taxi operator.Dubai’s colour-coded taxi system facilitates efficiency and transparency. It helps passengers select taxis based on availability, preferred service (such as women-only rides), or environmental priorities without worrying about fare disparities or service standards. Furthermore, the system fosters healthy competition among operators, all while maintaining safety and regulatory oversight.Booking and Availability TipsWhile the popular ride-hailing app Careem connects users to all taxi types, it does not allow selection by roof colour. Passengers who prefer a specific taxi operator can call the respective hotlines or use operator-specific apps like DTC’s app for red and pink taxis. This increases the chances of getting a preferred taxi colour matching individual needs.In summary, Dubai’s taxi fleet is a model of organisation and clarity amid urban complexity. The colour-coded roofs help passengers easily identify taxi operators, with consistent fare pricing and safety regulations across all. From the large red fleet of Dubai Taxi Corporation to the environmentally friendly green Arabia Taxis and the women-only pink cabs, the system caters efficiently to diverse needs. With convenient booking via hotlines, apps, and the popular Hala Taxi platform, Dubai’s taxis offer reliable, accessible transportation for both residents and tourists.","Dubai taxi roofs are colour-coded, with different colours implying a different kind of ride.

The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) of Dubai has unveiled a revamped taxi fare structure applicable immediately to all smart app bookings and regular city taxis. The updated fare schedule introduces higher minimum charges and booking fees tailored to different times of the day and days of the week, aiming to streamline pricing and enhance service quality across the emirate.Under the new fare system, taxi rides booked via e-hailing platforms such as Hala and Careem now carry a minimum fare of AED 13, up from the previous AED 12. The booking fees and starting fares (flagfall) fluctuate by peak, off-peak, and night-time windows.Peak HoursFrom Monday to Thursday, peak hours are set between 8 am and 9:59 am and later from 4 pm to 7:59 pm. During these time slots, passengers face a booking fee of AED 7.50 alongside a flagfall charge of AED 5. On Fridays, peak hours extend to 9:59 pm, with the same booking fee and starting fare. Meanwhile, Friday's late evenings between 10 pm and 11:59 pm see a slightly increased flagfall fare of AED 5.50, with the booking fee maintained at AED 7.50.Off-Peak and Night FaresOutside peak times on weekdays, from 6 am to 7:59 am and 10 am to 3:59 pm, the booking fee drops to AED 4 while the flagfall fare remains AED 5. Night-time travel, defined as between 10 pm and 5:59 am, carries a booking fee of AED 4.50 and a flagfall priced at AED 5.50.On weekends, Saturdays and Sundays experience peak periods from 4 pm to 9:59 pm and 10 pm to 11:59 pm, with a booking fee of AED 7.50 plus a flagfall of AED 5 during the early peak and AED 5.50 later into the night. Off-peak hours during the day maintain the AED 4 booking fee and AED 5 flagfall. The night-time booking and flagfall charges mirror weekday night tariffs.The comprehensive fare overhaul not only impacts commuter costs but aligns both traditional taxi and e-hailing pricing structures, providing greater consistency across transport options in Dubai.Aside from fare revisions, RTA has also launched a series of 28 initiatives enhancing the taxi experience. These include upgraded driver uniforms designed for Dubai’s climate, improved leather seating for hygiene and comfort, real-time air quality sensors installed in taxis, and integral feedback systems allowing passengers a direct line to RTA for service monitoring. Additionally, drivers benefit from reward programs totaling over AED 8 million.Commuters should expect slightly higher upfront costs during peak and late-night rides, but with improved ride quality underpinned by technological advances and service innovations by the RTA.The updated fares are effective immediately with the RTA monitoring usage and service levels to assess the impact of these changes on public transport in the city.","Dubai RTA announces taxi fare hike, surges booking fees for peak and night trips.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Microsoft AI CEO makes it clear: It is ChatGPT Atlas rival





AI Browser race is heating up. Just two days after OpenAI 's announcement of ChatGPT Atlas, Microsoft has launched a suite of new features for its AI assistant. This includes an ambitious project that builds artificial intelligence directly into one of its most central products -- Microsoft CoPilot. The new CoPilot Mode in Microsoft Edge goes beyond just being a browser extension and is said to be Microsoft’s take on AI browser category — an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. “Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,” Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. “With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms. ”Microsoft's announcement comes just two days after OpenAI introduced its Atlas browser, sparking comparisons due to their striking visual and functional similarities. While Copilot Mode features a darker background, text instead of a logo, and Windows-style interface elements, it closely resembles Atlas in design.Both integrate a chatbot into the “new tab” screen, though Copilot opts for a full-tab “ride-along” function rather than a split-screen approach.Industry observers note that browser design constraints may explain the similarities, as clean interfaces leave limited room for variation. The real distinction lies in the underlying AI models powering each browser, which will likely define the user experience.Microsoft’s release, planned for weeks and likely in development for months, coincides with a heated AI race between the two companies, or should we say 'Frenemies'. The near-simultaneous launches underscore the competitive tension between Microsoft and OpenAI, despite neither inventing the AI browser concept. As both companies vie for dominance, this week’s dual announcements signal a new chapter in AI-driven web browsing.",Microsoft launches CoPilot Mode in its Edge browser.

How this Spotify issue is affecting Android users







Spotify has acknowledged that its Android app is freezing and crashing for certain users when connected to Wi-Fi and confirmed that a fix is in development. In a response to the community, the music streaming company said:The problem primarily affects Samsung and Google Pixel devices; however, the app functions normally when users switch to mobile data. According to a report by 9to5Google, reports across Spotify's community forums suggest that the app becomes unresponsive shortly after connecting to Wi-Fi.Many users reported a pattern in which the app opens briefly, freezes, and then crashes. Some Reddit users note that playback resumes when Wi-Fi is turned off or when switching to a different network, suggesting the problem may be linked to specific routers or configurations.Reports indicate the issue has been affecting users for nearly two weeks before Spotify acknowledged it. While the company stated that its engineering teams are investigating the problem, it has not provided a timeline for a fix.The bug appears limited to certain Android devices and specific Wi-Fi setups. Some users have speculated that the problem could be linked to Chromecast-ready devices on the same network. This might explain why the crashes occur when connected to Wi-Fi, but not when using mobile data or offline mode.Users have reported that standard troubleshooting methods, such as clearing the cache or reinstalling the app, have not resolved the problem. Until a patch is released, users can try switching to mobile data or temporarily disabling Wi-Fi while streaming. Another temporary fix option is to roll back to an earlier app version from a couple of weeks ago.","Spotify's Android app is freezing and crashing for certain users when connected to Wi-Fi.

What cybersecurity experts said about new ChatGPT Atlas browser



“There will always be some residual risks around prompt injections because that’s just the nature of systems that interpret natural language and execute actions. In the security world, it’s a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, so we can expect to see other vulnerabilities emerge.”

“The main risk is that it collapses the boundary between the data and the instructions: it could turn an AI agent in a browser from a helpful tool to a potential attack vector against the user. So it can go and extract all of your emails and steal your personal data from work, or it can log into your Facebook account and steal your messages, or extract all of your passwords, so you’ve given the agent unfiltered access to all of your accounts,”

What OpenAI said about ChatGPT Atlas browser’s security



“Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague or friend.

For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks.

However, prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agents fall for these attacks,”

“logged out mode”

“Watch Mode”

“browser memories”





Cybersecurity experts have warned that OpenAI 's new ChatGPT Atlas browser could be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers can use this security flaw to turn AI assistants against users, potentially enabling theft of sensitive data or unauthorised access to bank accounts, experts claimed. The primary concern isa type of attack in which malicious instructions are fed to an AI system to make it behave in unintended ways, such as revealing sensitive information or performing harmful actions. Experts also said that all current AI browsers pose these security risks. OpenAI launched Atlas this week as an AI browser designed to help users execute tasks across the internet and search for answers.In a statement to Fortune, George Chalhoub, assistant professor at UCL Interaction Centre said:AI browsers face a security risk because they may not correctly distinguish user-generated prompts from content on untrusted websites. This allows attackers to create webpages containing hidden instructions that can trick the browser into performing actions such as opening the user’s email and exporting data.Some attackers may hide these commands using techniques like white text on a white background or embedding code within the site, making them difficult for users to notice but readable by the AI browser.Chalhoub explained.In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Dane Stuckey, OpenAI’s Chief Information Security Officer, said that the company was “very thoughtfully researching and mitigating” the risks associated with prompt injections.Stuckey wrote.Stuckey said OpenAI had introduced multiple measures to reduce risks and safeguard users, including rapid-response systems to block attacks, ongoing investment in research and security, and features such asandto enhance user control and safety.The ChatGPT Atlas browser is designed to make web browsing more interactive and assistive. It lets users search for information, plan trips, and book services directly through ChatGPT. The browser includesto remember user preferences and an experimental “agent mode” that allows ChatGPT to browse and interact with websites on the user’s behalf.","ChatGPT Atlas browser is designed to make web browsing more interactive and assistive.

Ex-Apple employee named Sam Sung remembers when he thought Apple would fire him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ex-apple-employee-named-sam-sung-remembers-when-he-thought-apple-would-fire-him/articleshow/124766058.cms,"How Sam Sung went from Apple’s store floor to become a social media storm

Building a new identity beyond the meme





Sam Sung's Apple business card went viral in 2012, sparking panic that nearly cost him his peace of mind. Over a decade later, he's Sam Struan—but wishes he'd handled the moment differently. Sam Struan, now 36, was working at an Apple retail store in Vancouver when someone posted a photo of his business card on Reddit. The name ""Sam Sung"" at an Apple Store became an instant internet sensation, and Struan thought his career was over.""I was so scared, and I just wanted to keep my head down and stay employed,"" Struan told Business Insider in a recent interview. When Apple called asking if he knew about the viral post, his first thought was termination—not the job security he actually had.Apple's response was swift but protective. The company pulled Struan off the sales floor after a reporter approached him at work. Colleagues were instructed not to identify him when customers came asking for ""Sam Sung,"" and his business cards were confiscated.For months, Struan played along with the ruse, pretending to be someone else when customers inquired. His Scottish accent helped mask his identity over the phone.The joke eventually faded, but the damage to his sense of security lingered.In 2013, Struan left Apple to pursue recruitment work. The following year, he auctioned his old business card and uniform pieces for charity, raising over $2,500 for Children's Wish. But the viral fame—or infamy—continued to shadow his professional life.Business Insider reports that Struan ultimately changed his surname to escape being defined as ""an internet joke."" He chose Struan, named after a village on Scotland's Isle of Skye. The decision also addressed practical concerns: all desirable social media handles were taken by Samsung , and research shows non-anglicised names can affect job opportunities.Today, Struan works as a consultant and résumé writer in Glasgow. While he doesn't regret the name change, he has one wish: ""I wish I could tell my younger self to see it as a funny thing...and enjoyed it for what it was.""","Sam Sung's Apple business card went viral in 2012.

GM compares CarPlay removal to Apple 's disk drive decision

Automaker prioritises data Control over customer preference





General Motors is expanding its controversial decision to eliminate Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from all future vehicles, including gas-powered cars, not just electric models. GM CEO Mary Barra confirmed the company-wide strategy during an interview on The Verge's Decoder podcast.The automaker initially dropped CarPlay support from its 2024 electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq, sparking customer backlash. Now, Barra says the phase-out will follow each vehicle's refresh cycle across GM's 40-model portfolio. When asked if new gas cars would lack smartphone projection, Barra responded: ""As we get to a major rollout, I think that's the right expectation. Yes.""GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson defended the move by invoking Apple's late co-founder. ""It's a very Jobsian approach to things,"" Anderson told The Verge's podcast. He compared removing CarPlay to Steve Jobs eliminating disk drives despite user complaints, arguing flash storage proved superior.Anderson claimed GM's proprietary infotainment system offers a ""much more immersive environment"" with better integration for features like charging infrastructure and Super Cruise.He likened using CarPlay to phone mirroring on a laptop—unnecessary when native solutions exist.The strategy centers on GM's new centralised computing platform launching in 2028, which will unify software across Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac brands. The Android-based system will include Google's Gemini assistant for voice commands.Industry observers note the move allows GM to control customer data, software updates, and potential subscription services—revenue streams worth billions annually by 2030. Barra emphasised GM maintains ""good relationships"" with Apple and will add Apple Wallet support for car keys, though Apple Music integration remains unconfirmed.The decision risks alienating customers in a market where CarPlay is available in roughly 80% of new US vehicles, according to S&P Global data.",GM CEO Mary Barra confirmed the company-wide strategy during an interview on The Verge's Decoder podcast.
