The rise of AI in healthcare is inevitable, but its role must be clearly defined and carefully regulated. Illinois has taken a groundbreaking step by banning AI platforms like ChatGPT from delivering therapy or mental health assessments without supervision by licensed professionals. Signed into law by Governor JB Pritzker, this legislation addresses growing ethical and safety concerns surrounding AI’s expanding role in mental healthcare. While AI tools offer efficiency and accessibility, they lack the empathy, nuanced understanding, and accountability essential for sensitive mental health support.The law ensures that treatment plans and emotional evaluations remain firmly in human hands, protecting vulnerable individuals from potential harm caused by unregulated AI advice and misdiagnosis. Illinois’ move sets a precedent for responsible AI use in healthcare, emphasising that technology ‘should assist, not replace’ qualified mental health professionals in delivering compassionate, ethical, and effective care.Under the newly introduced Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act, AI chatbots and platforms are strictly prohibited from:Unless these actions are supervised by a licensed mental health professional, they are deemed illegal under state law. Violators of this regulation could face penalties of up to $10,000 per violation, as enforced by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR). The law is designed to ensure that human expertise, emotional intelligence, and ethical standards remain central to the therapy process.With this law, Illinois becomes a trailblazer in responsible AI governance. By defining what AI can and cannot do in healthcare, the state sets a critical precedent for the rest of the nation.Rather than stifle technology, this law ensures that AI development proceeds with ethical boundaries — especially when human lives and emotions are on the line. Illinois is not the only state moving toward regulating AI’s role in therapy. Other states are joining the effort to draw clear lines between acceptable AI use and areas requiring human judgment.These actions reflect a national trend: mental healthcare must prioritise ethics, accountability, and human empathy, even in an AI-driven world.At the heart of this decision is a growing concern that AI lacks the emotional intelligence and ethical grounding necessary for mental health care. While generative AI systems like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities in simulating conversations, they cannot truly understand or respond to human emotions in context, especially during crises, trauma, or complex interpersonal dynamics where empathy, nuance, and moral judgment are crucial for effective support.Mario Treto Jr., Secretary of the IDFPR, said, “The people of Illinois deserve quality healthcare from real, qualified professionals and not computer programs.” This law protects vulnerable individuals from placing trust in a machine that might misunderstand or mishandle emotional crises.The American Psychological Association (APA) has been sounding the alarm since early 2025. In a report to federal regulators, the APA raised serious concerns over AI-driven chatbots pretending to be licensed therapists. These bots, while unregulated, have allegedly caused real-world harm.These events underscore the urgent need to prevent unregulated AI from entering sensitive domains where lives could be at stake.Illinois’ law doesn’t completely ban AI from mental healthcare — rather, it limits its application to non-clinical support roles.AI can still be used for:This approach encourages innovation without sacrificing safety.

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

Epic Games is set to roll out Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4 update, titled ""Shock 'N Awesome,"" very soon. However, ahead of the update’s release, the game is going through scheduled global downtime. This downtime is expected to end before the release of the Shock 'N Awesome update, which has rendered the game unplayable for players across the world. The upcoming update will focus on a mechanical insectoid bug invasion and will even feature a collaboration with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The new season's narrative centres around a bug invasion originating from the Kraken, which was summoned by the character Daigo.Players are waiting to jump into the latest content as soon as the scheduled downtime concludes. Here’s when the downtime is expected to end in the US, UK, Europe and more:Epic Games confirmed that server downtime for Fortnite's new season, introduced with patch v37.00, began at 2:00 AM ET (11:30 AM IST) on August 7, 2025. Matchmaking was disabled approximately 30 minutes earlier, at 1:30 AM ET (11:00 AM IST), marking the final window for players to join matches before the temporary maintenance period shutdown. Once a Fortnite season concludes, servers usually remain offline for about two to five hours before the next season becomes accessible.However, it can take much longer, like the 18-hour downtime before Chapter 5, Season 2. If things go smoothly, the servers will be back within the next few hours.Epic Games has announced that Fortnite’s v37.00 update is one of the most substantial seasonal updates so far, potentially requiring longer-than-usual downtime. While typical maintenance lasts, this one can last longer depending on deployment success.When Fortnite servers return, players will dive into a bug invasion storyline , with rift cracks in the sky and unstable map zones. New mobility-focused gameplay mechanics and Power Rangers-inspired Battle Pass items are expected. Technical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements will also roll out gradually after the v37.00 update.The patch also brings various bug fixes across Fortnite modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Save the World. Notable fixes include locker UI glitches, mobile control issues, and model display problems. These changes are based on player feedback and aim to improve performance and usability.","Fortnite servers are going through scheduled global downtime.

""Euphoria"" star Sydney Sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.A short video of 27-year-old actress Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral, with social media users impressed by her sharp aim and quick shooting.In the clip, Sydney can be seen dressed casually with earmuffs on.

Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.",A short video of Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral.

Trump REACTS To Republican Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle Ad; Here What He Thinks | WATCH

Sydney Sweeney Ad Row: JD Vance Unbuckles On 'Nazi' Noise, American Eagle Keeps It Casual

The Republican Registration That Launched a Thousand Memes



Shooting Range Superstar: From HBO to the NRA



“Sydney Sweeney: America’s New Annie Oakley .”

.” “She can shoot AND act? Wife me.”

“Meanwhile your favourite liberal thinks Nerf is a hate crime.”

The Power of Saying Nothing



The Post-Woke Celebrity Archetype



Ambiguity over affirmation

Style over slogans

Presence over preaching

Why MAGA Can’t Stop Posting Her



She’s young. The GOP’s problem has always been youth appeal. Sydney solves that.

She’s beautiful. Liberal feminists would call that “problematic.” The Right calls it reality.

She’s talented. Awards, praise, and prestige roles, all without being preachy.

She’s silent. No need to cancel. No need to apologise. No moral panic. Just vibes.

The Mirror, Not the Mouthpiece







In the first of the Republican National Conservative debates, when Trump steadfastly refused to participate to show Fox who was the man, then-presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy summed up the inflection point that was about to overshadow America: “You want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to ‘stick it to the man’? Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative. ”It’s true. Being liberal used to be an act of rebellion. But that rebellion became mainstream, corporatised, and institutionalised. It now lives on as HR slideshows, Twitter mobs, and avocado ad campaigns. Being young and Republican in 2025 is an act of defiance. And today’s protestants become tomorrow’s mainstream—evidenced by the fact that there are now more young people who identify as Republican than Democrat in America.It’s not clear when the Left lost the youth. Perhaps it was the cascade of madness: the woke craze of pushing trans behaviour in grammar schools. Demanding biological males be allowed to play in women’s sports. Saying illegal immigrants should have unfettered access to welfare. Shouting “Defund the Police” while shoplifting turned into organised retail looting. Declaring obesity a form of body positivity. Telling working-class white kids that their skin colour was an inherited sin.Declaring that whiteness ought to be apologised for.Slowly, the country shifted. Not by campaign ads or policy briefings—but by exhaustion. And as America began tuning out the moral lectures from elites, late-night comedians, and Hollywood, a new icon quietly emerged. Not a pundit. Not a senator. Not a firebrand. A muse.In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year—without attending a single rally or issuing a single press release. The star of Euphoria and The White Lotus has, quite by accident, become a MAGA icon. All it took was a leaked Republican voter registration, a denim ad campaign misread as a white supremacist dog whistle, and a shooting range video that could’ve doubled as NRA propaganda. Welcome to 2025, where political identity is crafted less by what you say, and more by which side claims you.It recently emerged that Sydney Sweeney is registered as a Republican in Florida. That was it.She didn’t make a political speech. She didn’t wear a MAGA hat. She didn’t retweet Ben Shapiro. All she did was file the correct paperwork, and the internet found it. Her name. Her address. Her party.Suddenly, the Right had its new pin-up girl. The Left had a meltdown.For conservatives, this was a cultural coup. A beautiful, talented Hollywood starlet—young, blonde, wildly popular—was officially red. Not pink. Not centrist. Red. And best of all? She wasn’t saying sorry for it.The silence was glorious. No apology tour. No clarifying tweet. No “I was hacked” statement. Liberals demanded answers. Progressives called it a betrayal. But Sydney Sweeney didn’t flinch. And in an age where even Instagram captions are pored over for political subtext, saying nothing is a weapon.“Great Jeans” and the Eugenics Panic of Summer 2025Then came the American Eagle campaign.Sydney Sweeney, in tight denim and a tank top, staring into the camera under the caption: “Great Genes.”That’s it. That’s the ad.Within hours, the internet exploded. Not because of the fashion. Not because of the cut. But because of the word: “genes.” Not jeans. Genes.The Left read it as a eugenics dog whistle. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman fronting a brand with a tagline that sounded suspiciously like white supremacy.Satirical Twitter lit up: “This is Leni Riefenstahl for Gen Z.” “Are they selling pants or the master race?”But the Right? The Right cackled. This was proof. Proof that the outrage industry had gone too far. That even a pun could be labelled fascist. That Sydney Sweeney, just by existing in her natural body and not issuing trigger warnings, was now enemy number one.American Eagle didn’t back down. Sales spiked. The controversy became the campaign. Sydney didn’t write the tagline. She was just the face. But once again, the narrative moved around her. She became the accidental symbol of conservative resistance to liberal hysteria.And then the final seal was pressed: the shooting range video.Sydney, in casualwear and earmuffs, loading a Glock like she was born in Fort Benning. First-time shooter? Didn’t look like it. Her stance, her focus, her shot grouping—it was enough to make half of Republican Twitter swoon.Clips went viral:The symbolism was perfect. A young woman in Hollywood, not just pretending to shoot in a Netflix movie—but actually firing rounds at a paper target, calmly, confidently. No virtue signalling. No trembling hands. Just recoil and resolve.The Right didn't need words. The imagery was enough. Mainstream Republicans quickly rallied behind Sydney Sweeney. Vice President JD Vance criticised Democrats for “calling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi,” saying it showed how out of touch the party had become with young voters. Senator Ted Cruz also weighed in, posting on X: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well. ” Inside the White House, officials saw the controversy as a win, saying it helped highlight what they view as liberal overreach and cultural policing. For many Republicans, Sweeney’s party registration wasn’t just a detail—it was confirmation that the culture war was breaking their way.What makes Sydney Sweeney such a potent figure is precisely her ambiguity.She doesn’t tweet about taxes. She doesn’t complain about feminism. She doesn’t post “I Voted” stickers or abortion fundraisers. She doesn’t do red carpet activism. And in 2025, that absence speaks louder than any hashtag.Hollywood thrives on performative wokeness. Stars compete to signal their virtue—whether it's climate guilt on private jets or apologies for being cast as straight characters. Sydney Sweeney has opted out.That, to a large chunk of America, makes her radical. Because silence is now seen as alignment. Refusing to bend the knee is tantamount to opposition. And that’s why both sides are fighting to frame her.To liberals, she’s naive at best, complicit at worst. To conservatives, she’s a unicorn: the apolitical star who still represents everything they believe in—beauty, freedom, guns, and denim.What Sydney Sweeney represents is something new: the post-woke Hollywood icon. Not a right-wing activist. Not a left-wing darling. But someone who has managed to float above the trench warfare.This new archetype is defined by:She’s not talking about CRT, climate change, or colonialism. She’s talking about her dog. Or her workout. Or her skincare routine. And yet, her silence makes her subversive.She isn’t against the Left in any direct sense. She’s just not of it. And that distinction matters.There’s a reason conservative media can’t get enough of her:In other words, she’s the anti-Lena Dunham. The anti-Alyssa Milano. The anti-everything that drove red-state Americans away from Hollywood.The Culture War’s Most Valuable PawnSydney Sweeney didn’t ask to be drafted into the culture war. She just voted. Then modelled. Then fired a gun.But in the content economy, you don’t get to choose how you're used. She became a screen onto which America projected its anxieties and aspirations. And the fact that she never pushed back made her more powerful.The Right turned her into a meme. The Left turned her into a warning. And Sydney? Sydney went back to work. To movies. To photo shoots. To her life.That may be the most radical thing of all.Sydney Sweeney is not giving speeches. She’s not asking for your vote. She’s not applying to be the next Kayleigh McEnany.She is simply existing. But in 2025, that’s all it takes.She is a mirror—reflecting everything America wants to believe, or fears to acknowledge. To the Right, she’s the proof that Hollywood doesn’t own the narrative. To the Left, she’s a reminder that silence can be resistance too.And in a country where every movie, every tweet, every ad campaign becomes a battleground, Sydney Sweeney has done the unthinkable.She said nothing. And everyone heard it.","In an era where even a sneeze can be interpreted as a political statement, Sydney Sweeney has become the conservative darling of the year.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

Putin Snubs Trump’s Sanctions Ultimatum; Vows Total 'Ukrainian Conquest' In Final Showdown





What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.





DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.





Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.





Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.





Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.









Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement





Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.





Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).





The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.









Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.





Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.





Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.













On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals.During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements.Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.Charging speeds are categorized as:These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.Qatar’s surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint. These high-speed DC chargers offer rapid refueling, increased convenience, and drive cleaner mobility choices. Supported by smart apps, infrastructure engagement, and expansion plans, Qatar is accelerating into a greener transport future.","Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative.

We're fed up, say locals

The official explanation





BENGALURU: Commuters along the Sarjapur-Dommasandra stretch are losing nearly an hour to cover just a 1.4km stretch, between Chambenahalli and Dommasandra Junction, especially during peak hours, prompting residents and institutions in the area to demand immediate relief.Local residents and educational institutions have sent letters to the traffic authorities, seeking their help to end the daily nightmare.Dommasandra Circle is a four-way junction connecting Whitefield and Marathahalli Ring Road, and traffic gridlock starts from the stretch beginning from Chambenahalli village road towards Dommasandra Junction, which is located on Sarjapur Road.According to locals, the construction of a flyover over Dommasandra Junction, which started in Sept 2020, has seen no progress. This has turned the area into a major bottleneck, leading to prolonged traffic jams that cause inconvenience to residents, especially during peak school hours. The gridlock causes daily delays for school-going children and office workers.To add to the problem, more than 10 educational institutions are situated in Sarjapur village, and IT employees often use the junction to reach Whitefield and Marathahalli for work.With massive residential projects being constructed, vehicular movement has increased with more residents shifting to the area.Residents along with heads of educational institutions in the area are demanding immediate govt intervention, saying long delays lead to multiple problems for office-goers and students.Sai PV, 46, a resident of Sarjapur village for the past six years, said: ""Things have become unbearable, especially since schools reopened. It takes me 45 minutes to an hour, and even longer on bad days. On one occasion, I left home at 8am and only reached my office in Ecoworld (on ORR) by 11am. There's no traffic police at key junctions, people drive on the wrong side, and the road is packed with construction trucks. It's extremely frustrating. ""Nitin Garag, chairman of the International School of Management Excellence, Dommasandra, said: ""Our students are consistently delayed for classes. Last week, students from ISME college missed their exams because they were trapped in a traffic jam. Children who should be home in 30 minutes now take over an hour and 15 minutes to get back. This is not just a traffic issue — it's affecting students' academic performance and daily lives. We're flooded with complaints daily.""Nooraine Fazal, CEO of Inventure Academy, Whitefield, said: ""At Inventure, we have 1,400 students and 260 teaching staff — 90% of whom rely on school buses. Every day, they face an exhausting commute due to severe traffic congestion caused by inadequate road and mobility infrastructure. We're losing precious teaching and learning time... How can students be expected to focus in class, or participate in sports and co-curricular activities, when they arrive at school already tired?""She added that it is high time the govt prioritised sustainable mobility solutions.A senior traffic cop said: ""The mess is because of the halted flyover construction. A lot of buildings have come up, and there are a lot of educational institutions as well. Once the construction is completed, traffic will ease by a lot. More than three cops have been deployed the whole day to control the traffic situation, but it depends on the vehicular flow as well.""","Commuters along the Sarjapur-Dommasandra stretch are losing nearly an hour to cover just a 1.4km stretch. The gridlock causes daily delays for school-going children and office workers.

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts. This helps free up system resources for actual money transfers.Yes, they are part of NPCI’s long-term strategy to manage growing UPI traffic and improve user safety.","India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warns ChatGPT users’ personal questions could be used in lawsuits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/think-before-you-ask-why-chatgpt-legal-queries-can-be-used-against-you-as-court-evidence/articleshow/123034984.cms,"Your ChatGPT conversations are not legally confidential



AI-Generated legal advice isn’t actually legal advice



Deleted chats with AI aren’t safe from legal scrutiny



Why it’s best to speak with a human lawyer instead of ChatGPT



Also Read:





ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways. Many users aren’t aware that anything they type into the chatbot, even deleted messages, can be retained and used as evidence in legal proceedings. Because the platform feels private and conversational, people may overshare without realising the potential consequences. Unlike lawyers, AI tools are not bound by confidentiality or ethical obligations. This means that sharing sensitive legal concerns with a chatbot doesn't just offer unreliable advice; it may also create a discoverable digital trail, potentially compromising privacy, increasing legal exposure, and causing unintended consequences. Before you confide in AI, it is important to understand these risks and why human legal counsel is still essential for safe, accurate guidance.In a recent appearance on the This Past Weekend podcast hosted by comedian Theo Von, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a candid admission: conversations with ChatGPT are not protected under any kind of legal privilege. ""Right now, if you talk to a therapist or a lawyer or a doctor, there’s legal privilege for it,"" Altman explained.""There’s doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s legal confidentiality. And we haven’t figured that out yet for when you talk to ChatGPT. "" This means if you type out a sensitive legal scenario, say, describing an incident that might amount to a crime or seeking strategic legal advice, that chat can potentially be disclosed in court. According to Altman, OpenAI could be legally compelled to hand over your conversations, even if they’ve been deleted.The consequences of this are serious. Legal experts like Jessee Bundy from Creative Counsel have warned users not to mistake AI for actual legal representation. ""If you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking [the chatbot] for strategy, you're not getting legal advice,"" Jessee E. Bundy posted on X (formerly Twitter). ""You’re generating discoverable evidence. No attorney-client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you."" She added that ChatGPT may feel private and helpful, but unlike a licensed attorney, it has no legal obligation to act in your best interest, and it can’t be held accountable for any incorrect advice it generates.When Malte Landwehr, CEO of an AI company, suggested that ChatGPT could still provide useful legal input even if it’s not confidential, Bundy strongly pushed back.“ChatGPT can’t give you legal advice,” she replied. “Legal advice comes from a licensed professional who understands your specific facts, goals, risks, and jurisdiction. And is accountable for it. ChatGPT is a language model. It generates words that sound right based on patterns, but it doesn’t know your situation, and it’s not responsible if it’s wrong.” Calling it “legal Mad Libs,” Bundy stressed that relying on ChatGPT for legal issues is both risky and potentially self-incriminating.User conversations with AI chatbots, including those that have been deleted, may still be stored and subject to disclosure in legal proceedings. As highlighted by ongoing litigation, some companies are required to retain chat records, which could be subpoenaed in court. This includes potentially sensitive or personal exchanges.At present, there is no legal obligation for AI platforms to treat user chats as confidential in the same way communications with a lawyer or therapist are protected. Until laws are updated to account for AI interactions, users should be aware that anything typed into a chatbot could, in some cases, be used as evidence.For legal concerns, whether it’s about a contract, criminal matter, or a rights dispute, it’s essential to consult a licensed professional. Unlike AI, lawyers are bound by strict confidentiality, legal privilege, and ethical duties. AI-generated responses may feel private and helpful, but they are not protected, verified, or accountable. While it may be tempting to turn to AI for convenience, doing so for legal issues could expose you to unnecessary risk.As artificial intelligence becomes more common in everyday use, it’s important to recognise its limitations, especially in areas involving legal or personal stakes. Conversations with AI are not protected under legal privilege, and in the eyes of the law, they can be accessed like any other form of communication. Until privacy and legal frameworks are in place for AI, it’s safest to avoid using chatbots for legal questions. For advice you can trust and that will remain confidential, always consult a qualified legal professional.","ChatGPT may be quick and convenient, but using it for legal questions could backfire in serious ways.

Blood Moon over Bahrain: Here's how to watch and photograph the celestial show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/blood-moon-over-bahrain-heres-how-to-watch-and-photograph-the-celestial-show/articleshow/123157364.cms,"Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025/Image: File

TL;DR:

Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, with the eclipse visible from 7:28pm to 10:56pm; peak totality (the ""blood moon"" phase) will last for about 1 hour and 22 minutes.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon, blocking direct sunlight and causing the Moon to turn a deep red as seen from Earth.

The event can be viewed safely with the naked eye or photographed using a camera or phone with some basic techniques, no special equipment required, but a tripod and planning help capture the spectacle clearly.

What is a Lunar Eclipse?

Details of the 2025 total Lunar Eclipse in Bahrain

Date: Sunday, September 7, 2025

Duration: The eclipse lasts about 5 hours and 27 minutes from start to finish, with the total phase (complete coverage) lasting about 1 hour and 22 minutes.

Visibility: The entire eclipse will be visible from Bahrain, with the moon turning deep red at its peak—a rare sight not seen in Bahrain since July 2018 and not expected again until 2028.

Key Timings for Bahrain (local time):

Eclipse begins: 7:28pm.

Totality (blood moon): approx. 7:49pm to 9:11pm.

Maximum eclipse: 9:11pm.

Eclipse ends: 10:56pm.

How to observe and photograph the eclipse

Watching the Eclipse

No special equipment is needed to enjoy a lunar eclipse, view it safely with the naked eye.

For a closer look or enhanced detail, binoculars or a small telescope are helpful.

If skies are clear, find a spot with minimal light pollution for the best view.

How to capture the Lunar Eclipse (Photography tips)

1. For Smartphone Users:

Stabilize: Use a tripod or steady surface; lunar eclipse photos are challenging in low light and any shake will blur the image.

Turn off the flash and consider including landmarks or silhouettes in your frame for context.

Zoom carefully: Use optical zoom if available, digital zoom can reduce image quality.

Night mode: Activate your phone’s night or astrophotography mode if available.

2. For DSLR or Mirrorless Cameras:

Lens: A telephoto lens (300mm or longer) will capture close-up details; a wide-angle lens can show the Moon in the landscape.

Tripod: Essential for keeping the camera still during long exposures.

Camera Settings:

Start with ISO 400 and a wide aperture (f/5.6 or wider). As the Moon darkens during totality, you may need to increase ISO or extend exposure time.

Manual focus set to infinity is recommended.

Use a cable release or self-timer to avoid camera shake.

Bracket your shots: Take multiple exposures at different shutter speeds to capture both the bright and dim phases of the eclipse.

Continuous Shots: You can take a series of images at regular intervals to document the different eclipse stages and create a composite later.

General tips:

Plan your compositions before the eclipse using moonrise and direction forecasts.

Practice your setup a night or two ahead to get comfortable with camera settings in low light.

Charge your batteries and clear your memory card in advance.

Bahrain is set to witness a rare and awe-inspiring celestial event on the evening of September 7, 2025, a total lunar eclipse visible across the Kingdom for over five hours. Marking the nation's first full ""blood moon"" event since 2018, the eclipse will cast the Moon in a deep red hue during its peak, captivating both skywatchers and astrophotographers alike. With full visibility, ideal conditions, and cultural significance tied to Islamic traditions, the eclipse promises a night of science, serenity, and spectacle.A lunar eclipse is an astronomical event that happens when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall across the surface of the Moon. This only occurs during a full moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned in a straight line (a configuration known as “syzygy”). When the Earth's central shadow (the umbra) completely covers the Moon, it's called a total lunar eclipse. During totality, sunlight refracted through Earth’s atmosphere bathes the Moon in a coppery-red light, leading to the popular term “blood moon”.Unlike a solar eclipse (which requires eye protection and is visible only from certain locations), a lunar eclipse can be observed with the naked eye from anywhere it’s night and is completely safe to watch.The event also aligns with Salat Al-Khusuf (the eclipse prayer), making it significant for both scientific and cultural reasons.The total lunar eclipse of September 7, 2025, offers Bahrain residents and visitors a rare chance to witness one of nature’s most spectacular celestial events, right from their own backyards. Whether you simply gaze at the Moon or aim to photograph its changing phases, the experience promises to be both inspiring and memorable. Remember to prepare ahead for the best view, check the timing, and enjoy a safe, awe-inspiring night under the “blood moon. ”","Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025.

"In Oman, white is law: Why can’t residents in Oman decide what colours their houses can be?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/in-oman-white-is-law-why-cant-residents-in-oman-decide-what-colours-their-houses-can-be/articleshow/123135325.cms,"Oman’s cityscapes, especially in Muscat are renowned for their uniform white and light-hued buildings/Image: Shutterstock

TL;DR:

Oman’s building regulations mandate that exterior building colours must be white or light shades (like ivory or beige) to preserve the country’s traditional architectural aesthetic and cultural heritage.





Any use of alternate or darker colours on building exteriors requires prior government approval through a formal application process with the municipality, ensuring urban harmony and adherence to environmental considerations.





The law also serves practical purposes by reflecting sunlight to reduce heat absorption, which aligns with climate considerations in Oman’s hot environment, and supports social and cultural cohesion by maintaining uniform cityscapes.



Historical and cultural roots

Preservation of National Identity: Omani cities place a strong emphasis on honoring traditional Islamic and Omani architectural styles. The predominance of white and its shades is intended to maintain continuity with local history, reinforce cultural identity, and protect the aesthetic coherence of urban landscapes

Architectural Heritage: The choice of white and light hues for exteriors dates back centuries, reflecting principles of Omani construction and Islamic design. The absence of skyscrapers and the preference for unified, modest colour palettes demonstrate a respect for peace, harmony, and traditional values.

Practical and environmental considerations

Climate Control: White and light-shaded surfaces reflect sunlight and absorb minimal heat, helping keep interiors cooler—a crucial benefit in Oman’s intensely hot climate. This not only improves living comfort but also reduces reliance on air conditioning and energy consumption

Sustainability: Building codes and municipal guidelines stress the sustainability of using such colours. They align with the local landscape and environmental requirements, ensuring both the well-being of residents and the resilience of Omani cities.

Legal framework and regulation

Mandatory Use of White and Light Colours: According to Muscat Municipality and official documentation, shades of white, including ivory, pearl, alabaster, and other variations are the only exterior paint colours that do not require special approval. Any proposal to use bolder or different hues must go through a formal application and accreditation process with the relevant municipality’s technical licensing department.

Application for Exceptions: Owners or contractors wishing to use non-white colours must submit an application (including samples and plans) to the municipality for assessment and approval. Recent years have seen minor relaxations, some areas now allow grey, beige, or light brown within local internal blocks but these are the exception and not the rule, aimed at maintaining overall visual harmony.

Urban aesthetics and social order

A Unified Urban Identity: The uniformity of colour serves to protect Muscat’s and Oman’s distinct architectural imprint. Community members and experts argue that this policy not only preserves tradition but also curbs “visual pollution” from inconsistent colour choices, ensuring an uncluttered, elegant cityscape.

Psychological and Social Impact: As described by local architects, the choice of building colour goes beyond decoration, it influences mood, perception, and social values by offering a calming, dignified visual experience tied to Omani customs.





Oman’s distinctive cityscapes, especially in capitals like Muscat, are renowned for their uniform white and light-hued buildings, a striking visual feature deeply rooted in the country’s cultural identity, climatic realities, and government regulations. This architectural tradition goes beyond mere aesthetics; it reflects a deliberate effort by the Omani authorities to preserve the nation’s heritage, harmonize urban environments, and provide practical benefits in the region’s intense heat.The Ministry of Regional Municipalities, Environment and Water Resources, along with local municipalities such as Muscat Municipality, have formalized these requirements, mandating the use of white or closely related light shades for building exteriors, with any deviation necessitating strict governmental approval. These regulations are part of Oman’s broader building codes and planning standards, designed to ensure environmental sustainability, social cohesion, and architectural integrity across rapidly modernizing urban centres.From historical architectural influences inspired by Islamic and traditional Omani culture to modern environmental considerations, the required use of whitewash and light colours serves to connect Omani cities with their past while addressing contemporary urban challenges.Residents and property developers who desire alternative colours must undergo a rigorous approval process, reflecting the government’s commitment to retaining Oman’s uniquely serene and cohesive cityscapes.Oman’s whitewashed urban landscape is a blend of practical wisdom, cultural pride, and legislative diligence. By tightly regulating external building colours, with strict preference for shades of white and requiring approval for all others, the Sultanate ensures that its skylines remain cool, harmonious, and deeply rooted in Omani identity and tradition. This makes Oman’s cityscapes unique in the Gulf and admired worldwide for their order, sustainability, and architectural beauty.",Oman’s building regulations mandate that exterior building colours must be white or light shades.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence.

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

"'We work so hard': Masked thieves smash into California store to steal Labubu Dolls worth $30k; target trendy collectibles ignoring cash, electronics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-work-so-hard-masked-thieves-smash-into-california-store-and-steal-labubu-dolls-worth-30k-target-trendy-collectibles-ignoring-cash-electronics/articleshow/123195480.cms,"Screen grab from Instagram video @onestopsaless





A group of masked thieves smashed into a California toy store in the dead of night and stole $30,000 worth of Labubu dolls, ignoring cash and electronics only to grab the viral collectibles, the store’s owner said.The break-in happened around 1.30 am Wednesday at One Stop Sales in La Puente, where four thieves allegedly shattered a glass door before heading straight for the viral monster dolls, co-owner Joanna Avendano said.“We worked so hard to get to this point, and for them to just come in and, like nothing, take it all away, it’s really bad,” she told ABC 7, as quoted by The New York Post.The Labubu dolls, a cross between a Cabbage Patch Doll and a Gremlin with bunny ears, were created by illustrator Kasing Lung and have become a TikTok fashion craze, with celebrities like Rihanna and Dua Lipa among their fans. Typically selling for up to $500 each, one recently fetched more than $100,000.Avendano believes the store, which opened just two months ago, may have been targeted after she announced a restock on social media. She recalled spotting a truck parked nearby before closing Tuesday night, later receiving a motion alert.“[I got] a gut feeling to check my phone,” she said. “Once I checked my phone, I saw there was motion, a sound that was coming through the front.”Surveillance footage showed the suspects bypassing the till and electronics, making a beeline for the dolls. The store posted on their Instagram handle, “Today we got robbed and they took all of our inventory, trashed our store, we are still in shock. If you guys can share this post, please and help us find these thief’s [sic].”The Los Angeles county sheriff’s department city of industry station is investigating the burglary.","Four thieves broke into a California toy store in the dead of night and stole $30,000 worth of Labubu dolls.

"$216k theft: California man charged for stealing rare Chinese texts from UCLA library; used aliases, returned fakes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/216k-theft-california-man-charged-for-stealing-rare-chinese-texts-from-ucla-library-used-aliases-returned-fakes/articleshow/123184568.cms,"Representative AI image





A California library user has been charged for stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at $216,000, US officials announced on Thursday, reports AFP.The suspect, identified as Jeffrey Ying, 38, reportedly used multiple aliases to access centuries-old works, some of them dating back over 600 years, at the University of California, Los Angeles library, then allegedly returned forged copies in their place. He is a resident of Fremont, the Bay Area.""The library noticed that several rare Chinese manuscripts were missing, and an initial investigation revealed the books were last viewed by a visitor who identified himself as 'Alan Fujimori,'"" the Department of Justice said, reported AFP.""Law enforcement also found pre-made labels known as asset tags associated with the same manuscripts that could be used to create 'dummy' books to return to the library in place of the original books.""When detectives searched the Los Angeles-area hotel where Ying was staying, they discovered blank manuscripts resembling the rare books he borrowed, as per the charging documents. Officials noted that Ying would often travel to China after checking out the materials from the library.Ying was found in possession of multiple library cards issued under various names.If found guilty of major artwork theft, Ying, who is currently in state custody, could face up to 10 years in federal prison.Rare and one-of-a-kind works in libraries are typically restricted to on-site viewing and are not allowed to be checked out like standard paperbacks.China has one of the fastest-growing art markets, driven by more state-run museums and a booming private sector.","Jeffrey Ying, 38, charged for stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at $216,000.

Las Vegas CEO receives bloodied pig head and letter in mail: Did he ‘ruffle some feathers’? Probe under way,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/las-vegas-ceo-receives-bloodied-pig-head-and-letter-in-mail-did-he-ruffle-some-feathers-probe-under-way/articleshow/123183225.cms,"Image: LinkedIn@/Blake J. Owens





A Las Vegas-based CEO has reportedly received a bloodied pig’s head in the mail, an incident believed to be connected to his interview discussing the use of AI in the real estate industry, reported 8 News Now.“Perhaps this person watched too much of The Godfather,” Owens said, as reported by 8 News Now. “Needless to say, I still take it very seriously, but don’t feel like I’m being truly threatened. It was a message.”Blake Owens, CEO of Agrippa, said he did not expect to receive a dead animal in the mail on July 29, but the accompanying letter gave him a clue as to why it happened.The letter addressed to Owens, signed only with the initial “M”, read, “saw your Marcus video, what a joke.”“Clearly, you don’t understand real estate wasn’t built by developers or investors; it was built by brokers. We did it the hard way, no shortcuts, no tech, just people,” the letter said.Owens said he holds no ill will towards someone who seems to be going through a tough time.“I don’t want to punch down on this person; they may be in a tough spot in life,” he said. “I do see this as an opportunity to show people you don’t become a better person by making another man a lesser person.”Owens noted that many people are uneasy about the rapid rise of AI because it represents a major transformation, adding that, “I think a lot of people are afraid of change and what’s coming with AI, because it really is a tsunami of change that people are trying to resist. But the more you embrace it, the better you’ll do, the more skills that you’ll accumulate more value you’ll bring to the table.”“You look at Agrippa, TensorWave, look at Otonomous Hotel, everyone is trying to bring AI to the forefront, and it sheds some light on how great this city is and what we can do with the talent we have here,” he said, as reported by 8 News Now. “May ruffle some feathers in the process, but in the long run, I think that it’s the best thing to do.”The case is currently under investigation by the Las Vegas metropolitan police department.","Blake Owens, CEO of Agrippa, said he did not expect to receive a dead animal in the mail on July 29.

"'Indian takeover of Frisco': NRI handle reacts to Texas viral video; 'That's not a threat, that's diversity'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-takeover-of-frisco-nri-handle-reacts-to-texas-viral-video-thats-not-a-threat-thats-diversity/articleshow/123170520.cms,"



An NRI handle on Instagram replied to the viral video of 'Indian takeover of Frisco' and said Indians are visible at Costco because they live there, work there and pay taxes there. The video originated from a social media user who complained that there were hardly any Americans at Costco in Texas' Frisco last weekend, and the store was teeming with Indians.""The Indian population exploded 4,510% in Frisco over the last 20 years, surging from 2.5% to nearly one-third of the city. H-1B betrayal robs our people of jobs, wipes out our heritage, and erases our communities. America's harsh new reality: The Great Replacement unfolding,"" the viral post claimed, drawing flak as social media users said it was a racially charged post. Some Americans expressed their disgust over the apparent Indian takeover while some wrote about ""smell and the RUDENESS"" of Indians. The person who posted the video claimed that she was apparently called a b**ch in an altercation with an Indian.""You should be grateful they are spending money in the economy as the average American is not doing so in that store,"" one post said.""No. They’re scamming Costco. Membership prices will go up, while they return entire baskets full of food items. We pay. They bleed us dry,"" the person behind the original post wrote.Amid the controversy, an NRI handle on Instagram said the story of the much-blamed H-1Bs needs to be heard as well.""As H-1B holders, we want to share the other side — the human side. We didn’t come here to erase anyone’s culture. We came here to build futures — just like generations before us,"" the post read.""Yes, we’re visible at Costco. Because we live here. We work here. We raise our kids here. We follow the rules. We pay taxes. 📍 Frisco is home to 36% Indian Americans now — that’s not a threat. That’s diversity. That’s contribution,"" the reply said.","An NRI handle on Instagram replied to the viral video of 'Indian takeover of Frisco' The video originated from a social media user who complained that there were hardly any Americans at Costco in Texas' Frisco.
