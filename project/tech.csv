Study: Aerosols making winter fog worse in north India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/study-aerosols-making-winter-fog-worse-in-north-india/articleshow/126471022.cms,".

DEHRADUN: Winter fog has long been a disruptive force in northern India, grounding flights, delaying trains and bringing daily life to a crawl across the Indo-Gangetic plain. Now, new research published in Science Advances journal reveals that air pollution is not just accompanying these fog events - it is actively making them thicker, longer-lasting and harder to disperse, reports Gaurav Talwar.The peer-reviewed study, led by researchers from IIT Madras, shows that high concentrations of aerosols - tiny particles released from vehicles, industries, biomass burning and other human activities - are ""invigorating"" fog layers over parts of northern India. Using 15 years of satellite data and high-resolution weather-chemistry simulations, the researchers uncovered a clear physical mechanism linking pollution to intensified fog.They found that during polluted conditions, fog layers over the Indo-Gangetic plain grew about 15-20% thicker, often reaching heights of 400-600 m. Crucially, this thickening happens mainly at the top of the fog layer, not at the surface.The reason lies in how aerosols interact with fog droplets - more aerosols lead to more droplets, stronger cooling, increased vertical mixing and ultimately a thicker fog layer.As per the study, satellite observations revealed that fog in polluted conditions contains larger droplets near its top - a finding that may initially seem counterintuitive. In many clouds, pollution leads to smaller droplets. But in fog, where moisture is abundant and the atmosphere is nearly saturated, the enhanced condensation and cooling at the fog top allow droplets to grow larger despite high aerosol concentrations.The study stresses controlling aerosol emissions is not only essential for cleaner air, but may also be critical for reducing the intensity and duration of winter fog in northern India.","Winter fog has long been a disruptive force in northern India, grounding flights, delaying trains and bringing daily life to a crawl.

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States a little below the usual aurora belt are not entirely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine often sit on the edge during moderate geomagnetic storms, and this week could be another of those moments. The display in these places is usually subtle. Colour may appear washed out, sometimes closer to grey than green. It often stays low in the northern sky, easy to mistake for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of New York fall into a similar category. For viewers there, seeing the aurora often depends on patience and expectations. Many who do catch it only realise later when photos reveal more than the eye noticed at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field.

Apple iPhone 17 survives being run over by seven cars in viral ‘ultimate drop test’ shocking viewers worldwide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/apple-iphone-17-survives-being-run-over-by-seven-cars-in-viral-ultimate-drop-test-shocking-viewers-worldwide-watch-viral-video/articleshow/126448993.cms,"Source: Instagram

How the iPhone 17 ended up under seven cars on a busy road



The ‘ultimate drop test’ leaves only minor damage



Internet reacts with disbelief and humour







Smartphone durability is usually tested in controlled labs, but one biker’s misfortune has turned into an extreme real-world experiment. A viral video circulating on Instagram shows an iPhone 17 falling off a motorcycle mount onto a busy road and being run over repeatedly by passing cars. Against all expectations, the device not only survived but continued to function. Shared by a rider known online as @dxbonthrottle, the clip has triggered widespread disbelief, humour and admiration for the phone’s toughness. Dubbed the “ultimate drop test” by viewers, the incident has reignited conversations around smartphone build quality, everyday riding safety, and whether modern flagship phones are tougher than manufacturers officially claim.The incident unfolded while the biker was riding with his phone secured to a handle-mounted holder. In the video, the device suddenly slips free and drops directly onto the road. Realising what has happened, the rider quickly slows down, takes a U-turn, and looks back to see his phone lying in the middle of moving traffic.Before he could retrieve it safely, multiple vehicles drove straight over the device. According to the biker, at least seven cars passed over the phone before he was able to step onto the road and pick it up, making the situation far worse than a simple drop.Despite the heavy traffic and repeated impact, the biker claims the phone remained operational. The original clip was shared with the caption, “My iPhone 17 got run over by 7 cars,” instantly drawing attention across social media platforms.What shocked viewers most was not just the survival of the phone, but the fact that it powered on and functioned normally after such punishment. For many, it looked like a stress test no manufacturer would ever dare to stage deliberately.In a follow-up video, the biker showed a close-up of the phone to reveal the extent of the damage. Surprisingly, the screen appeared intact, and the body showed no major structural issues. The only noticeable problem was damage to the camera lens.The rider captioned the second clip by calling it the “ultimate drop test,” adding that the camera glass seemed to have taken the brunt of the impact while protecting the rest of the device. Apart from that, the phone reportedly continued working as normal.Social media users flooded the comments with astonishment and jokes, worldwide, marvelling together at unexpected resilience and internet-breaking durability moments. Some claimed the phone deserved an award for survival, while others joked that their own devices crack under far gentler conditions. Several users suggested Apple should use the clip in future advertisements, calling it better than any official durability demo.Others pointed out that luck likely played a role, but still praised the build quality. One popular comment summed up the mood perfectly: the camera lens “took one for the team.”","A viral video shows an iPhone 17 falling off a motorcycle mount onto a busy road and being run over repeatedly by passing cars.

Microsoft wants to overhaul GitHub and on CEO Satya Nadella's target are…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/microsoft-wants-to-overhaul-github-and-on-ceo-satya-nadellas-target-are/articleshow/126475437.cms,"Microsoft is on a mission to reinvent GitHub as a leading hub for AI development, directly challenging emerging competitors like Cursor and Claude Code. With a noticeable dip in developer engagement, the tech giant is fusing AI tools into its operations and reshaping its organizational structure.

Microsoft's GitHub faces heat from Cursor, Claude Code in AI coding race

GitHub Copilot loses ground as Nadella pushes AI agent strategy

Microsoft is scrambling to keep GitHub relevant as a new breed of AI coding tools threatens to leave it behind. The company has started reshuffling teams and moving engineers around to turn its $7.5 billion acquisition into something more than just a code storage platform—it wants GitHub to become the command center for AI-powered software development.The problem is clear: developers are increasingly drawn to nimble AI-first rivals like Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code, which offer a different vision of what coding with AI should feel like. GitHub had the early advantage with its partnership with OpenAI , but that head start is eroding fast.Jay Parikh, who runs Microsoft's CoreAI Platform and Tools division, didn't mince words in an internal meeting late last year. ""GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code,"" he told employees, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider. The goal now is to make it ""the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development.""What does that actually mean? Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to follow developers wherever they work—whether that's in a command line, a web browser, VS Code, or even other Microsoft products.The company is also betting big on AI agents, envisioning GitHub as a dashboard where developers can orchestrate multiple autonomous coding assistants working together.To pull this off, Microsoft created the CoreAI group in January 2025 under Parikh, merging its developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub into one unit. But combining these groups on paper is one thing—making them work as one machine is another. Over recent months, Microsoft has been realigning sales teams and engineering resources. This week's move involves transferring a small batch of Microsoft engineers directly to GitHub to speed things up.Parikh also stressed the need to fix GitHub's basics. That means upgrading GitHub Actions, the tool that automates testing and deployment, along with better analytics, tighter security, and meeting data storage requirements for new markets.The competitive pressure is mounting. GitHub Copilot still has a strong user base, but it's bleeding market share to Cursor among key developer groups, according to Barclays data. The concern runs deep enough that a Microsoft engineer confronted executives in the meeting about how they plan to fight back against rivals ""moving quickly and capturing a lot of mindshare.""Nadella has made his stance clear across Microsoft: get on board with the AI transformation or get out. He's told executives this shift is as significant as the move to cloud computing, and he's pushing everyone to work with startup-level intensity. For GitHub, the timeline is tight. It needs to reinvent itself before developers decide the future of coding happens somewhere else.","GitHub is losing ground to AI-first rivals like Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Malaysia on Sunday temporarily blocked access to Grok, joining a growing list of countries taking action after the generative artificial intelligence chatbot sparked a global backlash by allowing users to create and publish sexualised images. xAI, the Elon Musk-led firm behind Grok, on Thursday said it would restrict image generation and editing to paying subscribers as it addressed lapses that allowed users on X to produce sexualised content of others, often without consent.On Saturday, Indonesia became the first country to temporarily deny access to the bot.In a statement on Sunday, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) said it would restrict access to Grok following repeated misuse of the tool ""to generate obscene, sexually explicit, indecent, grossly offensive, and non-consensual manipulated images, including content involving women and minors.""MCMC said it issued notices to X and xAI this month to demand the implementation of effective technical and moderation safeguards, but the received responses relied primarily on user-initiated reporting mechanisms and failed to address the risks posed by the design and operation of the AI tools.""MCMC considers this insufficient to prevent harm or ensure legal compliance,"" it said.xAI replied to a Reuters email seeking comment with what seemed to be an automated response: ""Legacy Media Lies.""X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.MCMC said access to Grok would be restricted until effective safeguards were implemented, adding that it was open to engaging with the firms.Muslim-majority Malaysia has strict laws governing online content, including a ban on obscene and pornographic materials. It has put internet companies under greater scrutiny in recent years in response to what it calls a rise in harmful content.

Rule #2: Go big with the right collaborations

Rule #3: Tell your story with courage



Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

AI, Aircraft and Salt Crystals: How the UAE Is Boosting Rainfall

Cloud seeding myths, misunderstandings and real weather



How cloud seeding works

Bottom line







Even if you have never been to a desert, you would have seen it on screens, how rain bursts despite arid desert sun but in the UAE, rain does not just happen by chance. Behind the scenes, scientists are actively nudging clouds to drop more water, using aircraft, salt crystals, artificial intelligence and some of the world’s most advanced weather-tech. Yes, there is a real-world rain machine in one of the planet’s driest regions.Welcome to the UAE’s cloud-seeding programme, a long-running national effort to enhance rainfall in a place that normally gets less than 100 mm of rain a year.The concept is simpler than it sounds. The UAE does not create rain from thin air, it enhances rain that might already be there. Scientists constantly scan the skies using sophisticated weather radars and 26 live camera feeds to spot developing cumulus clouds with potential.When conditions look right, they are ready to act. From meteorological radar data to real-time cloud analysis, researchers identify the best moments and places to intervene, no crystal balls required.When suitable clouds form, specially equipped aircraft take to the skies. Pilots fly into the updrafts, rising currents of air within convective clouds and deploy seeding agents like microscopic salt crystals mixed with magnesium, sodium chloride and potassium chloride.These tiny particles act as condensation nuclei, meaning that they attract and cluster water droplets within the cloud. As droplets grow larger and heavier, gravity finally pulls them down as rainfall instead of letting them evaporate in the dry desert air.In 2025 alone, the UAE reported 172 cloud-seeding flights, aiming to boost rain, not create weather from nothing.Think cloud seeding is stuck in the last century? The truth is that the UAE has invested in cutting-edge innovations -Together, these upgrades are pushing cloud-seeding into a more efficient “rain-tech” arena rather than a simple aerial stunt.Studies and operational data suggest that cloud seeding can increase rainfall by roughly 10% to 25% under the right conditions and is significant when every extra drop counts. Some research even links cloud-seeded storms to larger volumes of water reaching the ground, with gains measured in hundreds of millions of cubic metres of usable water annually, a real lifeline in a region where water security is a top priority.Still, experts caution that cloud seeding is not a perfect rainmaker as it cannot produce rain unless clouds already have moisture and results can vary depending on atmospheric conditions. The UAE’s water challenges are real. Rapid urban growth and limited natural freshwater mean the country relies heavily on desalination plants, recycled water and cloud seeding to meet its needs.Cloud seeding is far more cost-effective than desalination for extra water as one flight costs around US $8,000 per hour, a bargain when compared to the energy and infrastructure required to turn seawater into drinking water. That is why the UAE has invested millions of dollars into research and technology, including local manufacturing of seed materials and international scientific partnerships.Despite its gains, cloud seeding sometimes gets blamed for extreme weather like the surprising flooding seen in parts of the Emirates. However, meteorologists are clear that cloud seeding cannot create storms out of nothing. Heavy rains during major weather events are natural phenomena that cloud seeding can neither trigger nor control.In social media discussions, some critics call cloud seeding “scam technology” or blame it for unexpected rainfall but even sceptics acknowledge that the programme generally only enhances rain when clouds already exist. Cloud seeding in the UAE is not about controlling nature, it is about coaxing nature to give a little extra.As climate change increases weather unpredictability and water scarcity pressures mount, experts see rain enhancement as one valuable tool among many. Whether it is planes, drones, nano-powder or AI pilots, the UAE’s cloud-seeding programme is a fascinating blend of technology, meteorology and environmental strategy. It is a uniquely desert-born experiment in making the sky work for people.The UAE’s effort to “make it rain” is not science fiction, it is a real, high-tech programme combining radar, planes, salts, nano-materials and AI to enhance rainfall in one of the driest climates on Earth. While it has limitations, cloud seeding represents a creative response to water scarcity, one that other water-stressed regions are watching closely.","In 2025 alone, the UAE reported 172 cloud-seeding flights, aiming to boost rain, not create weather from nothing.

National weather alerts

What to expect in the coming days?

Humidity levels will remain elevated at night and mornings, creating chances for fog and mist.



Temperatures will continue to be cooler than average, especially in the northern and mountainous regions.



Cloud cover and scattered showers might extend beyond rainfall areas, making weather conditions changeable day to day.





Residents in the Northern Emirates woke up to the rhythmic sound of heavy rain today as a significant weather system moved across the region. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported intense downpours specifically hitting areas like Khorfakkan, Masafi, and Al Manama. While the rain brought a welcome drop in temperature and a refreshing ""winter vibe,"" it also turned streets into temporary streams, particularly in the mountainous regions of Fujairah.The showers weren't just a light drizzle; in many areas, the rain was accompanied by flashes of lightning and the distant rumble of thunder. For those living on the east coast, the grey skies provided a dramatic backdrop to the start of the weekend, but they also signaled a need for immediate caution as the volume of water quickly filled the natural depressions in the landscape.The NCM has issued both yellow and red alerts for large parts of the Northern and Eastern UAE. These color-coded warnings indicate that residents should be ""on the lookout"" and ""vigilant"" as convective clouds continue to form. These clouds are the primary engines behind the heavy rainfall and are expected to move further inland, potentially bringing scattered showers to parts of Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah as the day progresses.Weather experts explain that this surge in rain is caused by an extension of a surface low pressure, combined with an upper-air low pressure. This mix creates unstable conditions that are perfect for rain-bearing clouds to cluster. Wind speeds are also expected to pick up, reaching up to 40 km/h, which may kick up dust and reduce visibility on highways, making the commute between emirates a bit more challenging than usual.The winter weather pattern bringing rain is typical for this season in the UAE, and forecasters expect it to last through the weekend and into next week.Residents and visitors should keep up with modern updates from the NCM and follow official safety guidance as weather evolves.With unsettled weather expected to continue, residents across the UAE are advised to stay alert and follow official updates from the National Centre of Meteorology. Drivers should remain cautious on wet roads and during periods of reduced visibility, particularly in northern and eastern regions. Weather conditions may change quickly, with intermittent showers and cloudy skies likely through the day. Authorities urge the public to prioritise safety and plan travel accordingly.","The National Centre of Meteorology has issued both yellow and red alerts for large parts of the Northern and Eastern UAE.

AI cameras hit the streets





Real-time monitoring





Privacy and community considerations





Supporting Dubai’s long-term waste strategy









Dubai is taking a bold step to keep its streets spotless by introducing artificial intelligence-powered cameras to monitor public cleanliness. The initiative is part of the emirate’s “Smart Waste Management” framework and aims to detect littering and illegal dumping in real time, enabling authorities to act swiftly. With fines reaching up to Dh500, the system reflects Dubai’s commitment to maintaining high environmental standards while embracing advanced technology.The pilot project involves mounting AI-enabled cameras on waste collection and transportation vehicles. This approach creates a mobile surveillance network that covers roads, residential neighbourhoods, and public spaces throughout the city. Unlike traditional methods, the smart cameras instantly analyse captured images and display violations on interactive digital dashboards. This allows field teams to respond immediately to incidents, ensuring cleaner streets and more efficient enforcement.The system focuses on a range of negative behaviours, including littering in public places, improper disposal of furniture and bulky waste, and other practices that harm the city’s appearance or lead to waste accumulation. Residents and visitors caught violating the rules face fines of up to Dh500, underlining the authority’s zero-tolerance approach to public littering.According to Dubai Municipality, the AI system provides real-time monitoring and instant insights for authorities. The cameras can detect illegal waste dumping near containers, on pavements, and in public squares. The instant analysis of images ensures that field teams receive accurate information quickly, allowing them to take corrective measures without delay.Engineer Marwan Ahmed bin Ghalita, Director-General of Dubai Municipality, highlighted that the project is part of a broader strategy to enhance monitoring efficiency, support data-driven decisions, and develop sustainable policies for the urban environment. He emphasized that the results of the pilot phase will guide future expansion of the system across the emirate.Engineer Adel Al Marzouqi, Executive Director of the Waste and Sewerage Agency, explained that the AI system documents violations accurately while respecting community privacy. The project aligns with Dubai’s broader smart city and digital transformation objectives, combining technological innovation with responsible governance.The initiative contributes to the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Strategy 2041. By improving monitoring, accelerating response times, and reducing waste accumulation, the system enhances public cleanliness and overall quality of life. Dubai Municipality aims to position the emirate as a global leader in sustainability and urban innovation, demonstrating how technology can be leveraged to create cleaner, safer, and more livable cities.","The pilot project involves mounting AI-enabled cameras on waste collection and transportation vehicles.

The UAE is on the brink of a transport revolution with Etihad Rail’s national passenger service, set to begin operations in 2026. After years of infrastructure build-out and testing, the first integrated passenger rail network will link cities from Al Sila in the west to Fujairah in the east, offering a safe, efficient alternative to road travel and boosting connectivity across all seven emirates.Etihad Rail’s network will feature 11 strategically located passenger stations that serve urban centres, desert communities, coastal towns, and educational hubs. The service is designed to be more than just a commute, it’s meant to reshape how people move around the country.The most significant impact of Etihad Rail is the sheer amount of time it hands back to the average resident. For the thousands who endure the daily grind of the E11 or E311 highways, the rail service represents a massive lifestyle shift. Operating at cruising speeds of 200 km/h, the trains offer a precise, congestion-free schedule that makes road-trip fatigue a thing of the past.Forget the cramped commutes of the past. Etihad Rail’s passenger fleet, designed by Spain’s CAF, is built to accommodate up to 400 passengers per trip with a focus on ergonomics and luxury. Whether you’re a professional looking to work on the go or a family exploring the Emirates, the onboard environment is designed to feel more like an airline cabin than a traditional train.Etihad Rail understands that your journey doesn't end when you get off the train. The strategy focuses on ""first and last-mile"" connectivity. This means major stations like Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai will be directly linked to the Dubai Metro, while others will feature integrated bus terminals and dedicated taxi zones.For the ""common man,"" this means you can theoretically leave your home in Sharjah, take a quick bus to University City station, ride the train to Abu Dhabi, and be in your office in under 90 minutes—all while reading a book or finishing a presentation. The ""digital-first"" ticketing system ensures you can book everything via an app, using smart-gates for a frictionless entry.The project is a core pillar of the ""UAE Projects of the 50,"" aimed at fostering economic integration and cutting carbon emissions by 70-80% compared to road transport.Shadi Malak, CEO of Etihad Rail, stated, ""Our goal is to create a network that is safe, efficient, and sustainable. This is not just about transportation; it’s about enhancing the quality of life for every citizen and resident in the UAE.""With 10 of the 13 initial passenger trains already on UAE soil and undergoing safety certification as of early 2026, the era of the national railway is officially here.","Etihad Rail’s national passenger service is set to begin operations in 2026.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

What happens if no notice is given?



Dubai Rent Wars: The Legal Trick Every Tenant Needs to Know in 2026

How the system benefits tenants and landlords in Dubai



Know your rights before you renew.

Avoid paying more than the legal maximum.

Have evidence for negotiations and disputes.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared concerns about how artificial intelligence (AI) may change the structure of software teams. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu said that AI is making senior software architects more productive, but at the same time it is also reducing the need for junior engineers. This shift, he warns, could impact how future architects are trained. In the post, Sridhar Vembu further writes that senior architects today need to understand both technical requirements and the full technology stack to guide AI tools effectively and refine their output.“AI makes senior architects more productive and reduces the need for junior engineers,” he writes in the post, adding “The architect needs to understand the requirements as well as the technology stack well, to be able to guide the AI and fine tune its output”.“But if we don't have junior engineers, we don't get to train the next generation of architects - after all how does someone become a software architect without being a junior engineer first? I am still thinking through how this gets resolved,” he further says.Vembu’s comments reflect a broader debate in the technology sector, where AI tools such as coding assistants and autonomous agents are increasingly taking over tasks that were traditionally assigned to junior engineers.Experts have raised concerns about AI’s potential to reshape how technical careers begin.Vembu’s post has triggered discussion among engineers and social media users. Replying to his post, one user writes: “We still have some programmers who understand assembly languages. I think there will always be some engineers who would want to dig deeper. I think demand will play its role.”“Change the career ladder, not the headcount. Keep juniors, but redefine their role: AI-augmented engineers, not manual coders. Move juniors earlier into design, reviews, system thinking, and trade-off discussions while AI handles boilerplate,” suggested another.“With AI, all the unsolved problems of the intermittent steps become viable business problems. Hence new markets open to entrepreneurs for those middle step problems. Thats how we will see waves of new age entrepreneurs with many solopreneurs,” a third user commented.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared concerns about how artificial intelligence (AI) may change the structure of software teams.

The Canadian government is not looking to ban Elon Musk-owned microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) in the country. Evan Solomon, MP for Toronto Centre and Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation has clarified the same in an X post. “Contrary to media reports, Canada is not considering a ban of X,” Solomon wrote, quoting his earlier post where he said that the Canadian government is planning to introduce a bill to amend Criminal laws of the country to include deepfakes.“Deepfake sexual abuse is violence.

We will keep Canadians safe by amending the criminal code and holding abusers accountable.”Elon Musk’s X and Grok – the AI chatbot integrated into X have recently faced criticism for creating explicit images of users – especially women and children without consent.The crisis has prompted governments around the world to consider regulatory action against the social media platform, including India, US and UK.Recently, three US Senators sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai asking them to “immediately remove” Grok and X from their app stores respectively. The letter reviewed by CNBC was signed by US senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico who called on the tech giants to “immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities. ”In the letter, the senators said that the apps currently allow users to generate and distribute illegal content, adding that ignoring X's serious violations would make Apple and Google's content moderation practices meaningless.Commenting on the news, Elon Musk replied sharply stating “The real reason is that they hate free speech”.","The Canadian government is not looking to ban Elon Musk-owned microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) in the country.

While billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are focused on building rockets to reach space and other planets, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is exploring a different way to reach stars – by building the “eyes” to see it. According to a report by The New York Times, Schmidt Sciences – a part of the Schmidts’ philanthropic efforts – unveiled a plan at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society to disrupt the field of astrophysics.Through their philanthropic organisation, Eric and Wendy Schmidt are financing four advanced instruments known collectively as the Schmidt Observatory System, with a to rival the capabilities of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope within a four-year time frame.Schmidt’s strategy is different from decade-long missions of federal agencies like NASA as the foundation is focussed at creating instruments with three-to-five-year “experimental” lifespans. The projects largely take technologies already available. For example, they take high-performance computer chips with advanced AI capabilities and utilise them in novel ways to offer new capabilities to astronomers.“This is an experiment in accelerating astrophysics discovery,” said Arpita Roy, the lead of the Astrophysics and Space Institute at Schmidt Sciences, adding, “We accept much more risk”, which is “calibrated, thoughtful.”The observatory system will have four distinct projects designed to work in unison, targeting specific cosmic mysteries like dark energy and exploding stars.An orbital observer with a mirror slightly larger than Hubble's.A ground-based system in Texas consisting of 1,200 small telescopes.A massive radio survey in Nevada utilising 1,650 radio dishes.A ground-based optical array designed to measure the spectra (colours) of distant stars and planets, helping scientists identify the chemical makeup of atmospheres in other solar systems.“We think that we should operate these experiments for defined useful lifetimes and then move on to the next exciting thing,” Dr. Roy was quoted as saying.According to the foundation, the Lazuli mirror was downsized because of the ""malleable"" schedule of Elon Musk’s Starship.“Starship schedules are malleable.

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million? This ""Artificial Capable Intelligence"" benchmark, he believes, will reveal AI's real-world planning and decision-making prowess.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126366838,imgsize-28544,width-400,resizemode-4/126366838.jpg"

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.
