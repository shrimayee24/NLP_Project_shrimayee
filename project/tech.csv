PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pan-2-0-why-you-should-apply-for-new-pan-card-with-qr-code-top-5-benefits-explained/articleshow/115888220.cms,"Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards those without QR codes should apply for PAN 2.0. (AI image)

Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?

What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?

Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information. Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities. Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements. Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system. Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.

PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth.It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative.Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.Also Read | PAN 2.0 for free! How to get PAN Card with QR code with address update online; step-by-step guide Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, ""Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.""Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, ""Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.""Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 points According to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, ""Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.""","Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours while exhibiting no signs of anxiety.The contest took place at a shopping centre in Chongqing municipality on November 29, as reported by Jimu News.Ten contestants, selected from 100 applicants, were invited to the mall to participate in the competition, which required them to spend eight hours on a designated new bed. Before the contest, they surrendered their mobile phones and were prohibited from using any other electronic devices, including iPads and laptops, the South China Morning Post reported.In emergency situations, participants could use older mobile phone models with only calling capabilities, provided by the competition organisers, to contact their families.They were also required to adhere to a bed restriction rule, which allowed them to leave the bed for toilet breaks, but limited them to a maximum of five minutes each time.The organisers set a quota for the total amount of time contestants could be away from their beds throughout the eight-hour period, although this detail was not disclosed in the news report.Drinks and meals were provided, and participants were instructed to consume them in bed.In addition to being prohibited from using their mobile phones, competitors were not allowed to fall into a deep sleep or exhibit anxiety. They wore wrist straps to monitor their sleep quality and anxiety levels.Most contestants spent their time reading books or simply resting with their eyes closed.Ultimately, after verification by event officials, a woman surnamed Dong was declared the champion, achieving a comprehensive score of 88.99 out of 100. The organisers noted that she spent the longest time in bed, did not experience deep sleep, and displayed the lowest level of anxiety.The 10,000-yuan prizewinner donned pyjamas for the competition, earning her the nickname “pyjama sister” on mainland social media as the no-mobile-phone race gained viral attention online.Dong is a sales manager at a finance firm. In her spare time, she typically tutors her child and rarely browses her mobile phone aimlessly.The identity of the company sponsoring the competition and the purpose behind holding this event, which occurred in a mattress and bedding shop within the mall, remains undisclosed.","A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours.

Officers on ground



In the hunt for the killer of Brian Thompson, the CEO of United Healthcare, who was shot dead on a Wednesday morning in New York City, police are using advanced technology to piece together the moments before, during, and after the murder.Police are utilising advanced surveillance systems, facial recognition software, drones, and other cutting-edge technologies to track down the assassin.The crime, which took place just before 7 am, was captured by multiple surveillance cameras in the area. Footage from hotel cameras showed the gunman waiting outside the New York Hilton Midtown before approaching Thompson from behind and shooting him. A woman who witnessed the incident was seen running, while the killer fled through an alley and disappeared into Central Park on an electric bike.Hotel security cameras and other sources have tracked the killer’s movements before the crime. He was spotted smiling at the HI New York City Hostel and seen inside a Starbucks near the scene. Police have collected key evidence, including shell casings and a phone left behind by the killer.The NYPD is using its Facial Identification Section, which uses software to match crime scene images with known suspects in its database. However, the suspect's mask may complicate analysis. “The technology works well in controlled environments but is less effective on footage taken in low light or bad weather,” explained NYPD detective Herman Weisberg. Despite this, a recent image shows the suspect smiling after briefly pulling down his mask.New York City is equipped with over 18,000 CCTV cameras across the city. This, along with the NYPD’s Domain Awareness System, allows police to access a wealth of footage to help trace the suspect.Police are using GPS tracking and ballistics to trace the killer's movements before and after the murder. Reports indicate he used a bike, taxi, and bus, and made a phone call that helped pinpoint his location.The suspect’s gun jammed during the attack, but he quickly cleared the jam and continued firing at Thompson, according to security footage. “His ability to clear the jam is about as good as it gets,” said Weisberg, noting that this suggests the killer had significant firearm training.The NYPD is also examining DNA evidence found on items discarded near the scene, including a protein bar wrapper and a Starbucks coffee cup, which may provide further clues about the suspect. Ballistics analysis of the shell casings found at the crime scene is also underway, helping to narrow down the type of weapon used.The NYPD is using drones to assist in their search for the killer, given New York City's vast size and dense population. The city's Drone as First Responder (DFR) program, enables officers to deploy drones to respond quickly to emergencies, including tracking suspects. “Drones help us get a bird’s-eye view of the area, making the search more efficient,” said retired NYPD detective Leonard Golino. Drones are particularly useful in areas like Central Park, where traditional surveillance is limited.While technology is playing a crucial role in the investigation, experts agree that there is no substitute for traditional police work. “You need boots on the ground, talking to people and gathering evidence,” said Weisberg. Golino agreed to the statement, adding that the combination of high-tech tools and careful detective work is essential to solving this case.","Brian Thompson, the CEO of United Healthcare, was shot dead on a Wednesday morning in New York City.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

(Image: Google)

(Image: Google)In the landscape of digital memory, screenshots have been our personal and very informal archive – collections of information captured in moments of urgency or inspiration. Google 's Pixel Screenshots feature emerged from understanding how people interact with digital information, leveraging artificial intelligence to reimagine how people capture, store, and retrieve the fragments of information that compose their daily experiences.In a candid conversation that peeled back the layers of Google's innovation, Times of India - Tech caught up with Friedman, one of the key architects behind the Pixel Screenshots app.Max Friedman , Pixel Product Manager at Google, recalls the team's initial contemplation about personal computing. ""Our phones are becoming the most important device for us,"" he explained. ""However, a lot of the experiences on your phone aren't actually personalized.” This observation wasn't just a critique but a starting point for reimagining how technology could better serve user needs.The core philosophy behind Pixel Screenshots is deceptively simple: enhance an existing user habit without demanding additional effort. ""Users are already taking screenshots. They're already using those screenshots later on to reference information or complete tasks,"" Friedman noted. The challenge was to close the loop, making the screenshot journey seamless and intelligent.The team's approach was unconventional. Instead of building another agent, Friedman explains that the team wanted to think of AI more like a sidekick that helps you around on your journey, something. Their inspiration? The magical house in Disney's animated musical fantasy, Encanto. ""We thought about what if we could make the Pixel phone gradually more like the casita from Encanto, in the sense that it adapts to your needs as they come,"" Friedman said.Before the December Pixel drop, screenshot management was evolving towards more intelligent solutions. Google's new approach aimed to solve a common problem: the challenge of finding specific information within a growing collection of screenshots.""We've all been there - you know you saved that restaurant's address or your friend's Wi-Fi password somewhere, but scrolling through hundreds of images is a challenge,"" explained Sarah Chen , Google's VP of Pixel Software, during the Made by Google event, back in August, when Google announced the ""Pixel Screenshots"" with the Pixel 9 phones.The Pixel Screenshots app introduced a new approach to digital information management. Powered by Google's Gemini Nano technology, it could analyze and organize screenshots in real-time, transforming them from static images into searchable information repositories.Users could now ask specific questions like ""What was Sam's Wi-Fi password?"" or ""When does that concert go on sale?"" The app would scan through saved screenshots, extract relevant information, and provide answers alongside the source image.The fundamental challenge was understanding user behavior. People take screenshots constantly – concert tickets, restaurant recommendations, Wi-Fi passwords, product details – but retrieving that information later becomes a digital treasure hunt. ""We wanted to take an existing habit that users already have, and just make it better and more useful without requiring any additional effort,"" Friedman articulated.What's new with Pixel Screenshots in the December's drop, is this philosophy manifests through several nuanced features and it’s existence beyond just a mere app.First up is Gboard integration, which is a practical solution much welcomed. Friedman shared a personal anecdote: after screenshotting a concert ticket for an artist he didn't know, the app automatically surfaced the musician's music in Spotify. Just so you know, Gboard is the default keyboard app on Pixel phones, and as for the apps it works with, it works with all the Google apps and selected third-party apps, which Friedman says will continue to grow.Another integration that introduces another layer of interaction is Circle to Search. Users can now circle specific screen segments, saving precise information snippets with potential actions. ""We're trying to make it easier for users to save the information they want,"" Friedman explained.Privacy remains a critical consideration. Unlike cloud-based solutions that might compromise user data, these features operate entirely on-device, powered by the new Tensor G4 chip. ""We have a strong principle of processing everything on-device without sending information externally,"" Friedman emphasized, addressing potential user concerns transparently.The Details page now functions more like an intelligent assistant than a passive viewer. Action chips can extract specific information – a customer support email from a museum ticket, contact details from a screenshot, potential purchasing links. These weren't just conveniences; they were bridges between captured information and actionable experiences.Wallet integration adds practical utility, allowing users to instantly add tickets, boarding passes, and essential documents to Google Wallet . But it's more than a storage solution. The team was deliberate about maintaining user agency. ""We want to make sure the automation that we're doing helps achieve the user goal,"" Friedman noted.When questioned about potential redundancy with existing apps, like Photos, which already has some of the features that could have done the job, like natural language search, image sorting, and Lens integration, the team was clear. Screenshots serve a different purpose from photo collections. ""Users take photos for many different reasons, but screenshots are taken because users want to save some type of information and use it later,"" they explained.The current implementation is exclusive to the Pixel 9, a calculated approach to introducing AI capabilities responsibly. The device's processing capabilities allow for nuanced, on-device intelligence that older models cannot support, explained Friedman, when we asked that why this isn't available on older Pixel phones, which already have plenty of AI features.The long-term vision is thoughtful. Imagine screenshots that become contextually relevant years after capture – a restaurant recommendation resurfacing when you're in that city, or a forgotten contact detail emerging precisely when needed.In a world with overwhelming information, Pixel Screenshots offers a glimpse of technology that doesn't just digital fragments but makes them meaningfully accessible.As Friedman put it, the goal is creating an experience where things happen seamlessly in the background, personalizing your experience without requiring you to do anything different. ""Screenshots aren't just an app with a repository of information,"" Friedman asserted. ""It extends beyond the app into the operating system. It integrates into different surfaces where you are.""The most profound aspect of Pixel Screenshots isn't any single feature, but the underlying philosophy of device intelligence. Google's vision extends beyond mere screenshot management.""We're laying the groundwork for some incredible personal intelligence features,"" Friedman said, echoing the team's ambitious vision. The goal isn't just to organize screenshots but to create what he describes as a ""magical experience where things happen seamlessly in the background.""It's an ambitious vision, but a genuine attempt to understand and enhance how people interact with their digital lives. Pixel Screenshots' approach to our personal archival is a promising step towards a more intuitive digital ecosystem.","Google's Pixel Screenshots app is a new way to organize digital information. Users can now ask specific questions like ""What was Sam's Wi-Fi password?"" The app would scan through saved screenshots, extract relevant information, and provide answers alongside the source image.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116115610,imgsize-648638,width-400,resizemode-4/116115610.jpg"

‘Your death date’: This AI app claims can ‘predict’ when you will die,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/death-clock-ai-app-with-1-25-lakh-downloads-can-predict-date-of-your-death/articleshow/115885555.cms,"This is an AI-generated image



Death Clock gets 1.25 lakh downloads



How Death Clock predicts death

1)

Maintain a Healthy Weight

2) Regular Exercise

3)

Stop Smoking

4)

Balanced Diet

5)

Drink Less (or no) Alcohol

6) Good Sleep

7) Regular Check-ups

8) Manage Stress

9) Maintain Social Connections

10) Lifelong Learning

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN). Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost. However, taxpayers must pay a nominal fee for a physical PAN card. Existing PAN cards remain valid even without the QR code. This article provides a detailed overview of PAN 2.0 and a step-by-step guide to applying for and receiving your PAN card digitally.Before proceeding, determine whether your PAN was issued by NSDL or UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Ltd. (UTIITSL). This information is located on the back of your PAN card.The inclusion of QR codes on PAN cards enhances security by providing a quick and reliable way to verify their authenticity. The encrypted data stored in the QR code allows authorities, banks, and other institutions to easily access and confirm the cardholder's details, ensuring protection against counterfeit or fraudulent PAN cards.According to experts, individuals with older white PAN cards or those lacking QR codes should switch to the newer version featuring a QR code. They believe the updated PAN card design, known as PAN 2.0, will help mitigate fraud risks by incorporating a QR code for faster and more efficient verification.","The Income Tax Department has introduced PAN 2.0 to streamline the process of allotting and updating Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) Aimed at enhancing convenience and security, this initiative ensures that e-PAN cards, featuring a QR code, are sent to the registered email IDs of applicants free of cost.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115808793,imgsize-78664,width-400,resizemode-4/115808793.jpg"

The Kerala High Court has implemented stringent guidelines prohibiting the use of mobile phones for personal activities during office hours, citing concerns over disruptions to workplace productivity. In a memorandum dated December 2, 2024, the court addressed the growing issue of employees engaging in online gaming and excessive social media use during work hours. The directive aims to reinforce professional discipline and ensure the smooth functioning of office operations. By reiterating earlier notices from 2009 and 2013, the High Court has emphasized that any violation of these rules will be taken seriously, reflecting its commitment to maintaining an efficient and professional work environment.The memorandum clearly prohibits staff from using mobile phones for non-work-related activities during office hours, allowing exceptions only during lunch breaks. The court has explicitly banned activities such as:The court has emphasised that mobile devices should be used strictly for official purposes during work hours. Any use unrelated to job duties will be considered a breach of policy.The recent memorandum is not the first of its kind. Similar directives were issued in 2009 and 2013, targeting unproductive behaviors among staff members. However, the latest notice is more comprehensive, as it specifically addresses the rise in mobile-based distractions like online gaming and trading.Previously, some flexibility was granted to senior officials with designated responsibilities, but the current directive does not outline any such exceptions, emphasizing universal adherence across all levels of the workforce.To ensure compliance, the High Court has instructed controlling officers to closely monitor employee activities during office hours. These officers have been given the authority to enforce the new rules and prevent violations.Additionally, the memorandum underscores that any breach of the guidelines will be taken with the ""utmost seriousness,"" signaling potential disciplinary actions for non-compliance. This directive reflects the court’s intention to foster a professional atmosphere and uphold its operational efficiency.The Kerala High Court's move to curtail mobile phone misuse highlights a broader challenge faced by workplaces worldwide—balancing digital connectivity with productivity. With smartphones becoming indispensable tools for communication and information, their misuse poses significant challenges to organizational discipline. The court’s proactive stance sets an example for other institutions to address similar issues through clear policies and strict enforcement.",Kerala High Court has implemented stringent guidelines prohibiting the use of mobile phones for personal activities during office hours.

What iVerify found in its research

A mobile security company has identified previously undetected Pegasus spyware infections on both iPhones and Android devices. iVerify reports discovering five new variants of the spyware on devices belonging to everyday users, indicating that Pegasus is now being used to target not only high-profile individuals but also ordinary citizens.iVerify says that it has found spyware on people’s phones through its Mobile Threat Hunting feature that was launched in May.The feature allows users to perform a full threat scan on their smartphones in just five minutes and in May, the company offered a one-time free scan to its users. Over 2,500 users participated and iVerify uncovered seven Pegasus infections, a spyware tool known for its ability to completely compromise a device and steal sensitive data.These infections, dating back to 2021, spanned various iOS versions and demonstrated the ability of Pegasus to remain hidden from traditional security measures. The discovery supports iVerify's belief that spyware is more prevalent than previously thought, lurking undetected on many mobile devices.While the sample size was small and focused on high-risk individuals like journalists, government officials, and corporate executives, the infection rate of 2.5 devices per 1,000 scans is significantly higher than any previously reported figures.iVerify says that its May 2024 investigation uncovered multiple Pegasus variants – 5 unique malware types across iOS and Android.
