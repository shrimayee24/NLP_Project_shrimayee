UltraSound & fabric study

In the hushed corridors of the International Space Station (ISS), where human voices float as weightlessly as the bodies that carry them, Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla and his Ax-4 crewmates are helping decode the science of sound in space — quite literally.The Ax-4 crew recently lent their voices to the “Voice in Space” study, a pioneering experiment investigating how microgravity alters human speech. Without gravity’s usual pull on the lungs, diaphragm, and vocal tract, even subtle changes in vocal fold vibration or tone can occur.Using electroglottography — a non-invasive technique used to measure vocal fold contact during voice production — sensors and a series of scripted vocal tasks, researchers are capturing these shifts to understand how spaceflight affects speech patterns and cognition.The aim? To train artificial intelligence systems that can one day monitor astronaut health in real time — and perhaps even enhance voice-based AI technologies back on Earth. This study blends physiology, acoustics, and machine learning.“This experiment seeks to determine whether the influenced voice pattern and listening capabilities of the participant might be able to be detected by an AI algorithm. Vocal characteristics of an ISS crew member can change in a zero-gravity, and after undergoing cognitive function changes.Measurements of vocal fold vibration provide a quantitative indication of vocal fold function,” as per Axiom Space.Scripted voice audio recordings — reading, singing, vowel enunciation, audio pitch matching— allow for tonal analysis, Axiom said, adding that these data allow the investigator to test and analyse vocal performance and voice pattern changes in space and then evaluate how space journey influences the human voice.But sound wasn’t the only thing on the crew’s mind. Alongside the voice study, they completed multiple sessions of the “Cerebral Hemodynamics” investigation — an exploration into how blood flows through the brain in a zero-gravity environment.Without gravity pulling fluids downward, astronauts often experience a fluid shift towards the head. By using ultrasound to monitor these changes, scientists hope to develop better diagnostic tools for cardiovascular and neurological conditions — tools that could serve both astronauts and patients on Earth suffering from stroke, dizziness, or fainting.Also on the roster of the Ax-4 crew is the “Suit Fabric Study”, a technology demonstration examining how clothing behaves in space. This isn’t just about comfort — it's about performance. The crew wore sensor-equipped garments during exercise to observe how heat and moisture are managed when convection is no longer at play.“The findings could inform the design of next-generation space suits — and inspire innovations in thermal wear on Earth, from sports gear to medical textiles,” Axiom added.",Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla and his crewmates are helping decode the science of sound in space.

NEW DELHI: The man who allegedly raped a 22-year-old woman in her Pune flat left behind a chilling message threatening to leak her photos online and took a selfie using her phone before fleeing, police revealed on Thursday, as per PTI. The accused, who posed as a courier delivery executive to gain entry, remains at large nearly 24 hours after the attack. Pune Police have formed 10 special teams to trace and arrest him.The incident took place around 7:30 pm on Wednesday in the Kondhwa area, when the woman, an IT professional, was alone at home. According to Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde, the man convinced her he was delivering a bank-related envelope and asked for a pen. As she turned to get it, he entered the flat, latched the door, and forced himself on her.The woman told police she passed out during the assault and regained consciousness about an hour later. “She does not remember anything after that as she gained consciousness around 8.30 pm. She then informed her relatives and the police were alerted,” said Shinde.The accused reportedly used the victim’s phone to take a selfie that showed part of his face and her back.He also left a disturbing message warning her not to report the crime, saying he had taken her photos and would circulate them on social media. “I will come again,” the message read.Police are probing whether a chemical spray was used to make her unconscious. Forensic experts have collected nasal and oral swabs for examination. Investigators are also checking CCTV footage and data from the housing society’s gate management app to identify the suspect.A case has been registered under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation). Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar, who visited the scene, said, “Our teams are working on different leads and we are sure we will soon detect the case by nabbing the accused.”He confirmed that a sketch would be prepared once the woman’s medical examination is complete.",Man allegedly raped 22-year-old woman in her Pune flat.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future.

Ahead of their time: Basheer’s women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/ahead-of-their-time-basheers-women/articleshow/122260958.cms,"(The writer has authored several books and is the principal of Kunnamangalam Govt Arts & Science College, Kozhikode)





By: Jisa JoseThough he naturally maintains moderation in his writing, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer often becomes eloquent when it comes to women. His words brim with love, compassion and playful mischief. He deeply observed the world of women and the female mind. At the heart of his work are women’s stories—vivid portraits of their diverse lives, adventures, and survival.The women in Basheer’s stories, with their rural wisdom and simple perspectives, transform dull everyday life into a cheerful experience, as seen in Pathummayude Aadu. The novel, subtitled Pennungalude Budhi (Cleverness of Women), celebrates not bookish knowledge, but the lived intelligence women draw from experience. The writer stands in awe as a witness to the marvel of their world. Even ordinary events—like a goat’s birth, eating habits, or economic planning—appear new and fascinating to Basheer.His women often hold subtle authority over men, humorously undermining patriarchal norms. Basheer’s stance isn’t shaped by academic feminism but by a lived, compassionate understanding of women’s realities. His gender awareness stems from integrating stories he saw and heard—naturally, equitably.Many of Basheer’s women feel ahead of their time. Ayesha in Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu (1953), insists on finishing her BA before marrying. Sharp, socially aware and humorous, she has a scientific and liberal view of religion. While Nisar Ahmed tries to ‘modernize’ Kunhipathumma with love, Ayesha does it through friendship, education, and clarity. Her romance is merely a backdrop to a woman’s transformation. Through Ayesha’s character in 1953, Basheer articulated a profoundly modern perspective on women’s freedom. This vision remains pertinent today and in retrospect, considering society’s limited advancement, Basheer’s foresight proves astonishing.Basheer’s women aren’t confined to kitchens—they are smart and adaptive. When Kunhipathumma loses her home, she exclaims, “It’s a disaster, but we can meet people, breathe fresh air, stand in sunlight…” Her father cooks because neither she nor her mother knows how. In Poovampazham, Jameela Begum, without shame, suggests hiring a maid, noting she didn’t earn a BA to cook. Saramma in Premalekhanam (1943) remains iconic—bold, witty, independent, and non-religious in her love. Jameela Beebi in Poovampazham, who famously responds to a declaration of deep love with “Glad to hear, what other news from the town?”, is a miniature version of Saramma. Basheer’s works are filled with many such clever women.In Viddikalude Swargam, the protagonist, drawn by the inviting gaze of a prostitute, follows her into her home—only to flee in dismay upon witnessing the squalor within. “Was it for this that she looked at me with such a heart-wrenching longing?” he wonders. Indeed, the piercing gazes of women—whether brimming with love, desire, or maternal tenderness—lie at the heart of Basheer’s narratives. These looks linger, unsettling us, stirring laughter, sorrow, and pain. Through them, his women confront men, awaken them, and guide them toward seeing women as equals.No other Malayalam writer has portrayed the individuality and depth of women with such gravity or sincerity as Basheer","The women in Basheer’s stories, with their rural wisdom and simple perspectives, transform dull everyday life into a cheerful experience. The novel, subtitled Pennungalude Budhi (Cleverness of Women), celebrates not bookish knowledge, but the lived intelligence women draw from experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/47529300.jpg"
The man who wasn’t a litterateur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/the-man-who-wasnt-a-litterateur/articleshow/122260922.cms,"



By: Prof MK SanooIt was during the era of progressive literature that Vaikom Muhammad Basheer began writing. While Thakazhi, Kesava Dev, and Ponkunnam Varkey aimed to transform society through literature, Basheer’s approach was different—he treated stories simply as stories. Each of his works had a distinct pattern. This is evident in Poovambazham, Pathummayude Adu, or Pranayalekhanam. Though part of the progressive movement, he walked his own path—and his writing was truly unique.In Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu, he stressed the need for the Muslim community to adopt progressive thinking. In Mathilukal, he beautifully blended reality and fantasy—something no one else dared at the time. He wrote fearlessly, portraying characters as they were. His language was distinctive and lyrical. He coined unforgettable phrases like “Onnum Onnum Immini Balya Onnu” (One plus one makes a bit big one), introducing a new rhythm to Malayalam prose.I first met Basheer during a Sahithya Parishat meeting in the 1950s near TDM Hall. Curious, I went looking for him—but he wasn’t there. I found him instead at his bookstall near Boat Jetty, Kochi, selling his own books.I asked, “Why aren’t you at the Parishat meeting?” He quipped, “Isn’t that for litterateurs?” He never considered himself one.He lived then in a building opposite the Press Club. He’d sleep till noon, roam at night. We often gathered at Shanmugham Road—PK Balakrishnan, Ponjikkara Rafi, CJ Thomas, Basheer and I. Tea at the Sea View Hotel often followed, with discussions on literature and life.Basheer had clever book-selling tricks. He’d pitch a book with a quick, witty summary. His umbrella—custom-made nearby—had “specially made for Vaikom Muhammad Basheer” printed inside. Once, someone mistakenly took it. Basheer chased him: “Are you Basheer? No? Then open it—the name is written inside!”In the late ’50s, he sold the bookstall to NBS and moved to Thalayolaparambu. A board outside read: “Those who need tea should bring milk and tea. Water is plenty.” Later, in Beypore, he sat under the mangosteen tree. When he received a freedom fighter’s award, he joked, “Good to pelt dogs with.”Meals at his home were always generous—pearl fish fry a favourite. Once, he and Varkey bought food, left it in a room, and went for a drink. They returned to find a dog had eaten it. Basheer told it, “Hey dog, please go drink some water now.

By: N P AshleyMalayalis, it is said, have a knack for trolls and memes. From a shared filmic folklore, quick, funny, sarcastic images get churned out and shared instantaneously. One author who often features in this social media banter is Vaikom Muhammad Basheer.Be it Ettukali Mammonju—a prototype for politicians who take credit for everything (he would famously say, “It is me,” whenever any unmarried woman in the village got pregnant!), or Aakashawintayi (‘sky toffee), the name an interreligious couple, Sarasamma and Kesavan Nair, gave their child by picking lots, or Bhargavi Nilayam, now a synonym for haunted houses after the 1964 film—among literary figures, Basheer’s presence in popular culture is perhaps the most telling.Basheer didn’t write very much. His 40-year-long literary career can be fitted into two volumes. His writing became mythical not because of its simplicity, accessibility, or brevity—but because he was overwriting; writing on top of already existing materials; he was a palimpsest. He wrote against writing itself and that freedom has a certain deep and lasting appeal.He altered the content of Malayalam fiction by introducing Muslim social life and using writing as a tool for community reform.He crossed cultural boundaries, closed gaps—yet always remained an outsider: to literature, to society, even to his own community.Banned, targeted and arrested—Basheer’s early public life makes it difficult to say if they are creative writing pieces from a freedom fighter and political activist (against the Travancore diwan Sir C P Ramaswamy Iyer) or a fiction writer’s meanderings into activism. He is best a hyphenated entity in this phase.Even after his legal troubles ended post-1947, controversy followed him. His calls for reform and his resistance to moralism—naming a book Pavappettavarude Vesya(A Prostitute of the Poor), exposing ethical hollowness in Sabdangal (Voices)—kept him on edge. At a time when writers split into aestheticists and socialists, Basheer charted a third path: Writing about spirituality, the Sufi-Yogi worlds and ethical complexity, as CR Parameswaran noted.Friendship was his forte, humour his tool. He spoke lightly and irreverently of all castes and religions. This fluidity feels empowering to today’s content creators.But synthesizing such contradictions wasn’t effortless—it must have been excruciating. As NS Madhavan observed, it possibly drove him to madness. In an age when mental health conversations resonate with a huge section, Basheer, an author to be hospitalized in a lunatic asylum, becomes a person to reach after. Overwriting takes skill, social sense, and the right attitude—not to sound self-righteous or off-putting. When done right, it resembles Google’s landing page: The simplest interface masking the most complex backend algorithm. Basheer reads a bit like that.","Basheer’s presence in popular culture is perhaps the most telling. His writing became mythical not because of its simplicity, accessibility, or brevity.

(The writer is assistant professor and HOD, Malayalam dept, Farook College)





The Sacred, the Silly & the SublimeBy: Dr Azeez TharuvanaVaikom Muhammad Basheer’s works form a rich treasure mine—each reading reveals new layers of meaning that resonate with our times. Shabdangal (Voices) exemplifies this, especially relevant amid global wars, refugee crises and the search for human connection. Though short, the novel raises profound questions, like this conversation:“Everyone has a philosophy for life. I try to live by mine.”“I don’t have a philosophy. Maybe because I don’t feel connected to anyone?”“But you do—you’re connected to everyone.”“What relationship?”“Do you have a navel? It connects you to your mother—even if you never knew her… In the end, all of us are connected.”Basheer boldly explored themes like gender identity and the struggles of transgender individuals—topics still finding space in public discussion today. At the time, many conservative critics were shocked, but modern readers recognize his intent: To open up unfamiliar, often uncomfortable worlds to the Malayali imagination.His wide travels and deep empathy for the poor gave him a rare sensitivity. For Basheer, experience was everything.Living with Sufis and mystics, working various jobs, and meeting people on society’s fringes—hijras, male sex workers—he realized that life’s truths came from lived realities. Phrases like “Anal Haq” (I am the Truth) and “Aham Brahmasmi” (I am the Brahma) shaped his spiritual worldview.He saw that organized religion often demanded blind submission. He believed so-called sinners and criminals were often just people who had lost their way seeking peace, dignity and redemption. From this emerged a new kind of spirituality—one that embraced compassion over dogma and change over obedience.Like in the story Bhoomiyude Avakaashikal (The Inheritors of the Earth), animals and birds appear frequently in Basheer’s work. Long before environmental themes became common in Malayalam literature, Basheer was already weaving thoughts about nature and the environment into his stories. These early glimpses of ecological awareness reflect the depth of Basheer’s philosophical thinking—a belief in the unity and sacredness of all living things.This is the philosophy of oneness that flows through all of Basheer’s writing—a gentle, powerful consciousness that sees the whole universe as connected. His language—simple, direct and full of life—was unlike anything in Malayalam literature. As MN Vijayan said: “He sang playful tunes to his deepest sorrows… He reminded us, ‘I am my language.’” He stretched and reshaped the language, giving it new life. In fact, long before Dalit and feminist writers began questioning the limits of language, Basheer had already done so.He coined Lodkus Akhaya and Palungusan Vyakarana to poke fun at scholars but though some claimed he ignored grammar, Basheer in fact mastered and reshaped language with care and intention. Balyakalasakhi was a 500-page manuscript trimmed into a timeless 80-page classic.His works remain fresh because they can be read through many lenses—social, emotional, political, spiritual. At their core, they celebrate love, compassion, and unity. Basheer’s spirituality transcended religion. He believed in a divine spirit that connected all beings. This gave rise to a a certain intensity, a kind of madness. His mind often wandered along the thin line between mysticism and what others might call the abnormal. His creativity flowed from this unique space—where spiritual insight and unconventional thoughts lived side by side.In a letter from a mental hospital, he wrote: “I tried to understand everything… life, death… Is God a human idea? I believed—God exists. Call Him Allah, Khuda, or Lord—Allah exists…” To truly understand Basheer, we must open our hearts to the wide, tender world he saw so clearly.","Vaikom Muhammad Basheer’s irreverent humour, spiritual depth and unwavering humanist vision remain strikingly relevant.

Christian Dvorak turns down Canucks for Philadelphia Flyers



Vancouver Canucks still make key internal moves



The Vancouver Canucks began free agency with clear intent, General manager Patrik Allvin targeted veteran center Mikael Granlund. And reportedly pitching a four-year offer worth around $6 million annually, however, Granlund ultimately declined and opted to sign a three-year deal. That too with the Anaheim Ducks at $7 million per season.This rejection stung the Canucks’ front office. Especially after they had invested time and effort into securing a long-term playmaker up the middle. Granlund was seen as a strong fit given his two-way ability and experience, but Anaheim’s offer proved too appealing. The Canucks’ bid was competitive in term and value, but still fell short of what Granlund wanted.While the Granlund negotiations were unfolding, the Canucks were simultaneously pursuing another top-six option in Christian Dvorak. According to CHEK’s Rick Dhaliwal, Vancouver may have offered Dvorak a three-year, $12 million deal. Yet, he too walked away. Instead signing with the Philadelphia Flyers on a one-year deal worth $5.4 million.Dvorak’s snub came despite the Canucks being willing to invest long term.A move that showed their confidence in his upside, and the Flyers may have offered more clarity in role or vision. The factors that likely tilted Dvorak’s decision away from British Columbia.Despite the dual setbacks, not everything went wrong for Vancouver. On the opening day of free agency, the Canucks locked in star winger Brock Boeser with a seven-year extension worth $50.25 million. That deal ensured that one of their most important offensive weapons remains in place long term.The Granlund and Dvorak rejections will undoubtedly shape the Canucks’ next steps in the market. But the offseason is far from over, and Vancouver still has cap space and internal momentum. What remains unclear is whether these early losses reflect broader concerns among players about the franchise’s trajectory, or whether they were simply outbid in a competitive field.Also Read: What Connor McDavid’s mindset looks like now, according to insiders' view on Oilers contract extension drama",Mikael Granlund opted to sign a three-year deal with the Anaheim Ducks at $7 million per season.

Why Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani identified as African-American in his college application,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-origin-zohran-mamdani-identified-as-african-american-in-his-college-application/articleshow/122250461.cms,"The hierarchy of racial categories





The dilemma of tick-box identities





Colonial categories in modern America





The lesson









In America, race is not just a description of skin colour. It is a narrative slot, a ticket to visibility, legitimacy, or silent exclusion. For Zohran Mamdani , the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, the choice he made on his Columbia University application in 2009 now sits unearthed and scrutinised: he ticked the boxes for both “Asian” and “Black or African American. ”Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani does not identify as Black. When asked this week why he selected those categories, he said: “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background.”On the surface, it sounds like an act of calculated advantage-seeking. After all, Columbia, like most elite universities then, ran race-conscious admissions. Identifying as Black might have increased his chances in a system designed to redress centuries of racial exclusion. Critics, including Mayor Eric Adams, quickly pounced, calling it “an insult to every student who got into college the right way.”But the reality is more layered—and reveals how rigid, colonial-era categories continue to shape lives in ways that rarely match lived complexity.Indian but not Indian-AmericanMamdani is ethnically Indian, born to a Gujarati family whose ancestors migrated to East Africa over a century ago.His mother, Mira Nair, is a globally acclaimed filmmaker. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a leading postcolonial scholar. But in East Africa, Indians were neither fully African nor entirely Indian in identity. Under British colonialism, they were categorised as “Asiatics” and kept apart from both white settlers and native Africans. In Uganda, many thrived in trade and professions but remained perpetual outsiders—a status violently reinforced by Idi Amin’s 1972 expulsion of Asians.For Indian-Ugandans like Mamdani, identity has always been ambiguous: African by birth, Indian by ethnicity, but citizens of neither. When his family moved to New York in 1999, American forms forced a new set of boxes upon him. The Asian tick-box includes Indians, but rarely captures the distinct history of Indians in Africa. The African American box, meanwhile, is designed for descendants of the transatlantic slave trade and the Black American experience.Why, then, did he choose African American alongside Asian? Because in America, Blackness is recognised as a political identity born of struggle and oppression. Indian-American identity, by contrast, is often invisible—treated as an immigrant economic niche rather than a racial group needing justice. This is why even Kamala Harris , with a Tamil mother, emphasised her Black identity throughout her rise. The road to power in the US runs smoother through narratives of African American struggle than through the unrelatable caste-linguistic divisions of South Asia.Harris never denied her Indian heritage, but in political messaging, her mother’s dosa recipes were a footnote to her identity as a Black woman, a Howard alum, a beneficiary of the civil rights movement. To many Indian Americans, this choice felt strategic—because American categories do not accommodate multiple truths.For Mamdani, ticking African American was not an attempt to claim a heritage of slavery or Jim Crow. It was an attempt to signal: “I was born in Africa.” But these boxes don’t ask about birthplace; they ask about race. “Even though these boxes are constraining, I wanted my college application to reflect who I was,” he said. He also wrote in “Ugandan” under the form’s open-ended section. But forms don’t read nuance.The hack that revealed his application data showed no speeches or interviews where Mamdani ever called himself Black or African American. Indeed, his political identity today is rooted in his South Asian Muslim heritage. He campaigns in Urdu and Bangla, wears kurtas to rallies, and celebrates being the first South Asian man and Ugandan-born person in the New York State Assembly. Yet at African American gatherings, he references his African birthplace, Uganda’s independence, and his middle name Kwame, after Ghana’s first Prime Minister.It is a delicate tightrope. Identify as Black, and risk charges of opportunism. Identify as Indian, and remain a model minority forever foreign to the American political mainstream. Identify as both, and accusations of identity manipulation follow.The deeper problem is that these boxes themselves are relics of imperial racial classification systems. British colonial governments divided populations into neat ethno-racial columns to control them; the US census and college applications inherited this logic. They leave no space for Indian-Ugandans, Indo-Caribbeans, or Tamil Malaysians—global citizens whose identities transcend national borders.For Mamdani, none of it worked anyway. Columbia rejected him. He attended Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his identification as African American on that teenage application is now political ammunition.But perhaps his teenage choice was less about gaming the system and more about how the system forces you to game yourself: to slice your heritage into boxes acceptable to bureaucrats who will never understand why you don’t fit.And yet, despite ticking both boxes, Columbia rejected him.That is the lesson no one is talking about: racial categories promise advantage, but ultimately, they remain designed to keep out those who don’t fit neatly within them. Mamdani went to Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his teenage application choices are political ammunition.Ultimately, Mamdani’s saga is not about affirmative action cheating or woke posturing. It is about the impossibility of conveying ancestral history, racial experience, birthplace, migration, expulsion, diaspora, and faith into two or three colonial tick-boxes.He remains an Indian, an African, a Muslim, and an American—all identities that refuse to fit neatly on a Common App form. The tragedy is that he, like so many children of empire, had to choose at all—and that even choosing everything was not enough.","Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, ticked the boxes for both ‘Asian’ and ‘Black or African American’ on his Columbia University application in 2009.

Renovating the world’s largest fountain: The hidden work behind Dubai’s iconic water show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/renovating-the-worlds-largest-fountain-the-hidden-work-behind-dubais-iconic-water-show/articleshow/122257332.cms,"The Dubai Fountain’s renovation upgrades its flooring, technology, and maintenance systems, with engineers and workers operating 24/7 across its 18-football-field-sized pool/ Image: Instagram

A Fountain Like No Other: The Scale of the Task



The Ongoing Renovation : A Major Overhaul



New Flooring System: The old concrete surface had occasional cracks, disrupting maintenance. Now, a durable waterproofing system is being installed, including a special primer and insulation designed to help with water retention.

Glowing Blue Tiles: These tiles, visible beneath the water from all angles around the lake, are not just visually striking but also functional, adding to the overall aesthetic and longevity of the structure.

Robotic Technology : A Fountain Powered by Machines



Choreography Bots: These robots control the movement of the water jets, ensuring they spray in perfect rhythm with the music.

Lighting Bots: These robots adjust the lighting, ensuring that the visual effects are perfectly in sync with the water's movements.

Fixed Water Jets: These jets spray water in harmony with the beats, adding another layer of coordination to the show.

Keeping Everything Clean: The Underwater Maintenance



A Temporary Pause, but the Show Goes On







The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music. As the world’s largest choreographed fountain, it draws millions of visitors each year to the heart of Downtown Dubai. But what does it really take to maintain and renovate this iconic spectacle? From intricate underwater technology to the massive team of engineers and robots working tirelessly, the work behind maintaining and renovating the Dubai Fountain never stops. It goes on around the clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ensuring this iconic water show continues to dazzle visitors long into the future. Here’s a closer look at the monumental effort behind the scenes.The Dubai Fountain isn’t just big; it’s enormous. The fountain stretches over an area as large as 18 football fields. Beneath its shimmering surface lies a sophisticated network of water jets, robotic arms, and lighting systems, all working in perfect harmony to create the mesmerizing shows that have made it famous.Given its sheer size, it's no surprise that keeping the fountain in top shape requires a lot of work. In fact, hundreds of engineers and technicians are involved in maintaining the fountain, handling everything from daily upkeep to major renovations.In April 2025, the fountain was temporarily shut down for a five-month renovation to improve its performance, aesthetics, and longevity. The project, confirmed by the fountain’s developer Emaar, involves an array of upgrades. Though the renovation has taken the fountain offline, the work behind it will ensure that the Dubai Fountain continues to dazzle for years to come.Key improvements include:These changes aren't just about making the fountain look better, they aim to ensure that the fountain runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come.One of the most fascinating aspects of the Dubai Fountain is the extensive use of robotic technology. From choreography bots that control the movement of water to lighting bots that match visual effects with the rhythm of the music, these robots play a crucial role in every performance. In fact, the programming of a single song for the fountain can take several weeks, as multiple robotic systems must be synchronized to create the perfect dance of water and light.The renovation also involves upgrading the technology behind these systems to improve precision and reduce the time it takes to program a new performance. As a result, the fountain will continue to deliver unforgettable shows, with even better choreography and lighting.Beneath the water's surface, maintenance is just as crucial. The fountain's 1.3-meter-deep lake houses the powerful jets and robots, which means it requires constant attention to stay pristine.To keep the fountain looking its best, underwater robots are deployed regularly. These machines clean the lakebed and ensure the water remains at the highest quality. The newly installed soft flooring makes cleaning even quicker and more efficient, allowing for easier maintenance. Water quality checks are conducted regularly, with samples taken from various parts of the lake to ensure the water stays fresh and clear.While the fountain is temporarily out of action, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a taste of its magic. The construction area has been cleverly integrated with digital display screens that play archival footage of the fountain’s past performances, in sync with the light shows from the Burj Khalifa. So even though the live fountain shows are paused, the spirit of the Dubai Fountain is still alive, giving visitors a preview of the wonder to come.The renovation is scheduled to wrap up by October 2025, just in time for the cooler months. When the fountain is back in action, it will not only look better but also function more smoothly, thanks to the impressive behind-the-scenes work currently underway.","The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music.

As more villa communities expand across the UAE and private pools become increasingly popular, a growing public safety concern has emerged especially the rising number of drowning incidents involving children under five. Health authorities and civic officials are now urging residents to take stricter precautions and adhere to comprehensive safety regulations introduced by Dubai Municipality.Recent months have witnessed several tragic drowning cases that have cast a spotlight on the dangers associated with private pools, even when water bodies seem small or harmless.On April 5, six-year-old Ayanvit Chhaparwal, a finalist on UAE’s Got Talent, died in Abu Dhabi after falling into a swimming pool and suffering a head injury. Two month later, on June 27, a 15-year-old Sudanese boy drowned while swimming with friends at the UAE University Olympic Pool in Al Ain.In Dubai, an Indian family is now facing over Dh100,000 (approximately US $27,230) in medical bills after their son, Ali, nearly drowned in a community pool. The accident happened just days after the family moved to the UAE in search of a better life.Similarly, on April 4, a two-year-old child tragically lost his life after drowning in a bucket of water at his family home in Ras Al Khaimah’s Sidrouh neighbourhood, a harrowing reminder that even minimal amounts of water can be fatal.Officials from Dubai’s Health and Safety Department, which investigates such incidents, revealed that most local drowning cases involve unsupervised children, underscoring the critical role of adult supervision.According to the World Health Organisation, drowning remains one of the leading causes of accidental deaths globally, a trend that’s mirrored across the UAE.To mitigate risk and ensure residential pools are safe for all users, particularly children, Dubai Municipality has issued comprehensive safety regulations that apply to all private pools in residential villas. These rules cover any water feature deeper than 300mm, including hot tubs, inflatable pools, and prefabricated spa pools.Here are the key responsibilities and requirements as laid out by the authorities:All private pools must be registered with Dubai Municipality before construction begins. Any modifications, such as adding slides or diving boards, also require prior municipal approval.Safety around private pools begins with proper fencing and barriers. All fences must be at least 1.2 metres high, designed to be child-resistant, climb-proof, and free of gaps that children could squeeze through. Additionally, pool covers and safety nets are strongly recommended, especially in homes with young children. These covers must meet the ASTM F1346-91 international safety standards and be sturdy enough to support the weight of two adults and one child in case of emergency. It is also important to keep rescue tools like pool brushes or leaf scoops nearby, ensuring quick access if needed.Access to the pool must be carefully controlled to prevent accidental entry by children. Gates and entrances should open outward, be self-closing and self-latching, with locks installed at least 1.5 metres above ground to keep them out of children’s reach. The use of garage doors or automated perimeter gates for pool access is strictly prohibited to avoid unsupervised entry. Windows overlooking pools require fixed security screens or limiters that prevent openings wider than 100mm. Balconies close to pool areas must also have child-proof barriers installed for added safety.Maintaining clean, healthy pool water is essential. Owners must conduct daily testing of water for pH levels, chlorine, and temperature, with more thorough bi-weekly checks for additional parameters. Furthermore, microbiological testing is mandatory every two months to ensure compliance with health standards. For emergencies, CPR instructions must be clearly displayed near the pool, alongside important contact numbers for ambulance, police, and civil defence services. A well-stocked first aid kit and rescue equipment, such as poles or hooks, should always be within easy reach to respond promptly in case of an accident.While Dubai Municipality’s regulations set a robust safety framework, the most critical element remains active adult supervision, officials say.“Safety begins at home,” the municipality stresses. Teaching children how to swim and staying vigilant whenever they are near water are the most effective ways to prevent tragedy.For further details on compliance or to register a pool, residents are encouraged to contact the Health and Safety Department of Dubai Municipality via:","Dubai Municipality has issued comprehensive safety regulations that apply to all private pools in residential villas.

Tyres: The Critical Contact Point With the Road

The Five-Year Tyre Rule

The Deadly Danger of Leaving Children in Cars

RTA’s Essential Tips for Safe Summer Driving

Ensure your vehicle’s air conditioning is functioning properly and effectively cooling the interior during hot days.

Check engine oil and radiator coolant levels regularly, especially in summer when engine temperatures can spike.

Maintain correct tyre pressure and inspect tyre condition carefully to avoid blowouts caused by high temperatures.

Keep your brake system clean and well-maintained; replace worn brake components to ensure optimal braking performance.

Keep the vehicle tidy and clean, this helps with early fault detection and prolongs the vehicle’s lifespan. Always ensure windscreens, windows, and headlights are clean for clear visibility.

Avoid parking under direct sunligt for extended periods. Whenever possible, park in shaded areas to protect the vehicle from extreme heat damage.

With summer temperatures reaching dangerous highs, the RTA’s campaign serves as a crucial reminder that simple preventive measures can save lives on the roads.





As the UAE enters the peak of summer with temperatures soaring up to 50°C, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued an urgent reminder for motorists to conduct routine vehicle checks and servicing. The goal is to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of all road users during the harshest months of the year.In coordination with the Ministry of Interior and Dubai Police, the RTA has launched its annual campaign titled ‘Summer Without Accidents’, emphasizing precautionary measures to avoid traffic incidents caused by the extreme weather.Ahmed Al Khzaimy, director of traffic at RTA’s Traffic and Roads Agency, emphasized the importance of simple yet effective maintenance:“(We) urge all motorists to conduct regular and routine maintenance checks, including a quick inspection before setting off. This should involve a visual check of tyre pressure, engine oil and coolant levels, and ensuring there are no oil or water leaks beneath the vehicle.”He explained that such quick inspections could help prevent unexpected breakdowns, which tend to increase the risk of traffic accidents and negatively affect road safety across the Emirate.Authorities have particularly stressed the need for motorists to check their tyres carefully.Tyres are the only part of a vehicle that comes in direct contact with the road, and under the intense summer heat, worn-out or old tyres are at risk of bursting. Such incidents can lead to severe road accidents with disastrous consequences.Highlighting the dangers, Abu Dhabi authorities shared a video showing multiple vehicles, including a truck and several cars, losing control due to damaged tyres. The vehicles skidded across the roads, crashed into barriers, overturned, or sustained significant damage, all posing additional hazards to other road users.RTA regulations strictly prohibit tyres that are older than five years from being used on UAE roads. This rule aims to reduce tyre-related accidents, which spike during the summer months.Speaking to local news media outlet Khaleej Time, Thomas Edelmann, founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, said:“The number of vehicles parked on the hard shoulder with tyre defects increases in summer. Tyre debris, mainly from decomposing commercial vehicle tyres, can be seen more during the hot summer months.”Edelmann added:“The solution is to continuously educate motorists about the importance of tyre safety and maintenance. Tyres must be procured, fitted and maintained properly, especially during summer.”One of the most alarming risks highlighted in the ‘Summer Without Accidents’ campaign is the danger of leaving children unattended inside vehicles. The RTA warned that children left in cars can suffer from suffocation and death within minutes, even if the air conditioning is on.Ahmed Al Khzaimy strongly urged parents:“Not to leave their children in the car, not even for a short period.”He stressed that the air conditioning does not provide sufficient protection in a sealed environment where temperatures can rise rapidly and dangerously.To help motorists stay safe during the hot summer months, the RTA shared the following practical tips:",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued an urgent reminder for motorists to conduct routine vehicle checks and servicing.

Skyscrapers and dense urban structures in the city, however, trap heat and block wind, creating what scientists call the “urban heat island effect.” Better Air Circulation: Gentle breezes often flow across the desert during the evenings. In contrast, buildings in the city obstruct natural air currents, making the urban environment feel stagnant and warmer.

The Science Behind the Desert’s Cooling Effect

Desert Temperature Drop : After a blazing day with temperatures soaring past 40°C, the desert can cool down by as much as 10 to 15°C at night. This makes for a surprisingly pleasant evening environment.

How to Experience the Cool of Dubai’s Desert

1. Evening Safaris and Overnight Escapes

2. Activities and Tips for Cooler Hours

Discover the Desert’s Natural Cool





Dubai is known worldwide for its iconic skyline, luxurious lifestyle, and relentless summer heat. But many are surprised to learn that the vast desert surrounding the city often feels cooler, especially in the evenings. While it may seem counterintuitive, given the desert’s direct exposure to the sun, scientific and environmental factors explain why escaping to the sands can be more refreshing than staying in the city.This article dives into the real reasons behind this phenomenon, explaining everything from urban heat effects to ancient Bedouin wisdom, and highlighting how to enjoy the desert’s cooling charm during the UAE’s warmest months.Despite the extreme daytime heat in both city and desert, the difference in nighttime temperature is stark. Here's why:The temperature drop after sunset in the desert is not a fluke, it’s the result of natural geographic and atmospheric conditions.The desert’s cooler side comes alive after sunset. Evening and night safaris offer a refreshing break from daytime heat, with activities like camel riding, dune bashing, and sandboarding feeling much more pleasant.Overnight desert camps take the experience further, combining stargazing, bonfires, and Emirati cuisine under the open sky. Bedouin-style tents, traditionally made from breathable animal hair, stay cool during the day and warm at night, a testament to centuries-old desert living.To enjoy the desert comfortably, plan activities like morning hot air balloon rides, wildlife spotting, or stargazing in the evening when temperatures are lower. Wear breathable fabrics like linen or cotton, stay well-hydrated, and bring a light jacket, as nights can get surprisingly cold. With the right timing and preparation, Dubai’s desert becomes a peaceful, cool escape just outside the city.While Dubai’s urban heat can be relentless, the desert just outside the city offers a natural, surprising reprieve. Thanks to quick cooling sand, breezy nights, and open skies, the desert remains an oasis of calm, even in the height of summer.Whether you're planning a romantic night under the stars, a cultural safari, or just a refreshing evening away from the heat, the Dubai desert proves to be more than just sand dunes, it's a living, breathing example of nature’s ability to balance extremes.So next time the city heat gets too much, consider heading into the desert. The cool, quiet night awaits.","Dubai’s expansive desert allows heat to escape freely. Skyscrapers and dense urban structures in the city, however, trap heat and block wind.

A Cry for Help Through Technology:



Support from School Social Worker:



Father’s Justification and the Law’s Intervention:



Ongoing Support and Monitoring







In a heartbreaking yet courageous act, a 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse, utilizing the Dubai Police smart app to seek help. The boy, identified only as A.A. , had been suffering in silence for months, unable to understand the reasons behind the physical punishments or to speak out about the pain he endured. His story, which has now been shared by Dubai Police, serves as a crucial reminder to the public that help is always available and that no child should suffer in silence.A.A.’s situation came to light when he was discreetly able to report his father’s cruelty via the Dubai Police smart app. Although the boy did not fully comprehend why he was being singled out for punishment, especially since his younger siblings were not subjected to the same treatment, the constant beatings left visible bruises on his body and a deep emotional scar. The pain was becoming unbearable, and he feared his classmates would notice. This fear, however, did not stop him from reaching out for help through the app, one of the many confidential channels available for reporting abuse.A.A.’s journey toward safety and healing began when his school noticed troubling signs. Teachers observed that the boy was struggling academically and showing physical signs of abuse. It was a school social worker who gently built trust with A.A. and, after some time, helped him feel comfortable enough to report the abuse through the police app. Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Ali Al Matrooshi, Director of the Child and Women Protection Department at Dubai Police, emphasized the importance of the school's role in identifying signs of abuse and supporting the child in coming forward.Dr. Al Matrooshi stated, “The child was afraid to speak up, but the bruises on his body and the fear on his face spoke volumes.”After receiving the report, Dubai Police acted swiftly, calling in the boy’s father for questioning. During this process, the father admitted to physically punishing his son but insisted that he never intended to cause harm. According to the father, his strict discipline was meant to “toughen up” his son, similar to the way he himself was raised. However, this justification was met with a firm response from the police.Dr. Al Matrooshi explained, “He thought that being strict would prepare his son for life, but instead, it left the child feeling alone, afraid, and falling behind in school.”The police made it clear to the father that such methods of discipline were not only damaging but also illegal under the UAE’s child protection laws. He was warned that corporal punishment and similar forms of abuse are punishable by law. The father expressed regret and promised to change his behavior, pledging to adopt more appropriate methods of parenting.The police have assured that A.A. will receive the necessary emotional support and counseling, in collaboration with social services. Dr. Al Matrooshi reassured the public that Dubai Police are committed to protecting children, providing support, and helping families heal. ""We are here to protect children, listen to them, and help families heal,"" he said.The case serves as a powerful reminder of the resources available to victims of abuse in the UAE. In line with the UAE’s Wadeema Law, which protects child rights, the General Department of Human Rights urges anyone aware of abuse to report it immediately, through the police app, website, or hotline (901). The Child Oasis Center at Al Twar police headquarters is also available for those who need in-person assistance.","A 10-year-old boy in Dubai recently reported his father for repeated physical abuse.

The report highlights both UAE cities as global leaders not only in their nighttime beauty but also in safety for nighttime explorers.According to the Travelbag study, Abu Dhabi holds the distinction of being the safest city in the world to explore at night. Dubai also ranks highly, placing among the top three safest cities globally after sunset. This recognition underscores the strong emphasis both cities place on security and creating safe environments for residents and tourists alike.The study examined a range of factors including nightlife offerings and the quality of the urban environment at night. Dubai boasts 190 venues that stay open late, catering to night owls and tourists looking for evening entertainment. However, the city does face challenges with noise and light pollution, scoring 52.58 out of 100 on this scale.Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has fewer late-night venues, with 62 establishments open late. It recorded a slightly lower pollution rating of 47, reflecting a quieter, less intense nighttime environment.This report taps into a broader trend known as ""noctourism,"" travel experiences and activities designed for after sunset. Booking.com predicts that nighttime travel will be one of the top trends in 2025, with tourists increasingly seeking unique adventures like stargazing and cosmic events in areas with minimal light pollution.Such trends are reflected in Dubai’s growing offerings. Many tours now focus exclusively on nighttime sightseeing, a practical response to the city's hot daytime temperatures. Tour agencies promote night tours that let visitors enjoy Dubai’s spectacular cityscape illuminated under the stars.Late-night desert safaris have also surged in popularity. Travelbag’s research notes a 22 percent jump in searches for night safaris, as tourists seek cooler and more atmospheric desert experiences after dark.To enhance night activities and provide comfort during hot summer months, Dubai Municipality has introduced “night swimming” at three public beaches. This initiative extends beach hours into the cooler night, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy swimming and beach activities without the intensity of daytime heat.These measures, along with the thriving nightlife scene, showcase Dubai’s commitment to making nighttime tourism safe, accessible, and enjoyable.This detailed report was compiled from Travelbag’s latest study, as referenced by multiple news outlets covering travel and urban lifestyle trends.","Dubai and Abu Dhabi ranked among the top three safest cities globally after sunset.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
