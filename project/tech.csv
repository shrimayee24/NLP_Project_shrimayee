Elon Musk sets ambitious AI goals: xAI to release a ‘great’ AI-generated game and Grok Imagine to produce a watchable AI movie by the end of 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-sets-ambitious-ai-goals-xai-to-release-a-great-ai-generated-game-and-grok-imagine-to-produce-a-watchable-ai-movie-by-the-end-of-2026/articleshow/124382384.cms,"Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation

Elon Musk’s xAI studio aims to create innovative AI-generated video games



Experts warn AI content creation cannot match human creativity and vision



Musk’s Grok aims for AI movies while raising copyright and ethical concerns

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation.

BRUSSELS: The EU Friday demanded digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm, as all but two member states signalled openness to restricting social media access for minors.The European Union has stringent rules regulating the digital space, including what children should be able to see, but there is increasing concern that more needs to be done. Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",EU demands digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.

Abu Dhabi is making significant strides in healthcare innovation with the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at predicting and preventing chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer. The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi (DoH) recently unveiled new AI-powered initiatives at GITEX Global 2025, as part of its vision to help residents live longer, healthier lives.One of the standout projects is the Next-Gen Wellness program, which combines wearable technology, AI-driven health analysis, and physician-led care to detect health risks early and promote personalized wellness plans. This program marks a shift from traditional reactive healthcare to a proactive model, where monitoring and intervention happen continuously. Complementing this is the Smart Healthcare Platform, a cloud-based digital system that facilitates real-time health interventions for better patient outcomes and better system efficiency.These innovations build on the foundation laid by Abu Dhabi’s widely acclaimed AI patient risk profiling system, which is now fully operational across all hospitals and clinics in the emirate and covers the entire population.This tool scrutinizes a person’s health records from birth and assesses the risk of developing 14 different diseases, including diabetes and various cancers. What sets this system apart is its ability to clearly explain the reasons behind risk scores, helping doctors make informed decisions and begin treatment early. Large language models embedded in the system assist physicians by quickly retrieving the most relevant patient information and even support patients through interactive AI-enabled tools available on the Sahatna app.Abu Dhabi’s healthcare transformation is guided by a three-pillar strategy focusing on longevity, best-in-class care, and system resilience. Ibrahim Al Jallaf, Executive Director of Digital Health at DoH Abu Dhabi, emphasized the importance of this approach at GITEX: “In Abu Dhabi we have something we call a patient risk profile. This looks for 14 different diseases, such as the probability of somebody getting diabetes or different types of cancers, and it tells the physician, based on the patient that's right in front of you, what is their probability of getting this disease… it informs the physician, and it also gives the physician more information — what lab tests, what recent visits gave the indication to the AI use case that this person has a medium probability of diabetes. ”He also highlighted the supportive role of AI, stating, “Artificial intelligence is there to support the physician. It's very important that we have explainability in the model... It doesn't act on behalf of the physician - instead, it allows the physician to use their knowledge and understanding.”Earlier efforts in the UAE focused heavily on AI-driven disease detection and risk management. Dubai’s EJADA AI platform, for instance, successfully analyzed millions of health records to identify people at high risk of diabetes, leading to a substantial reduction in treatment costs. Meanwhile, university-led research collaborations have deployed AI to discover new immunotherapy targets for diabetes and cancer by studying genes related to blood vessel cells, opening avenues for faster and more cost-effective treatments.The seamless sharing of data through Malaffi, the emirate’s health information exchange, ensures that medical professionals have access to a patient’s full medical history at every visit, supporting more precise and timely interventions. The emirate is also nurturing a collaborative innovation ecosystem, welcoming partnerships with global tech leaders and research institutes to pilot and scale AI solutions. This positions Abu Dhabi as a leading testbed for smart healthcare technologies, set to benefit both local communities and global populations.The latest AI advancements in Abu Dhabi represent a leap forward from earlier initiatives, moving beyond risk prediction to continuous wellness support and personalized treatment. This approach is transforming healthcare delivery, enhancing physician capabilities, and advancing Abu Dhabi’s mission to improve the health and longevity of its residents through innovation and technology.","The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi recently unveiled new AI-powered initiatives at GITEX Global 2025. One of the standout projects is the Next-Gen Wellness program, which combines wearable technology, AI-driven health analysis, and physician-led care. The emirate is also nurturing a collaborative innovation ecosystem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124534482,imgsize-150480,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-healthcare-innovation-team.jpg"

"""Yalla,"" ""Habibi,"" ""Inshallah"" and more: The hilarious Arabic mistakes almost every Indian expat makes in the gulf",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/yalla-habibi-inshallah-and-more-the-hilarious-arabic-mistakes-almost-every-indian-expat-makesinthegulf/articleshow/124526300.cms,"From “yalla” to “habibi,” explore the history, fun uses, and classes to learn Arabic for Indians in the Gulf / Image generated by AI for illustrative purposes only

Arabic words Indians have given their own twist

Yalla: While it means ""let's go"" in Arabic, in the Gulf-Indian context, it’s often used to urge someone to hurry up or get moving. For instance, ""Yalla, we’re going to be late!""



Habibi/Habibti: Translating to ""my dear"" or ""my beloved,"" this term is used affectionately among friends and family. ""Habibi, how are you today?""



Inshallah: Meaning ""God willing,"" it's used to express hope for the future. ""Inshallah, we will meet tomorrow.""



Mashallah: Used to express appreciation or admiration, often in response to something good. ""Mashallah, you’ve done a great job!""



Khalas: This means ""enough"" or ""finished."" It's commonly used to indicate that something is done or to stop an action. ""Khalas, I’ve had enough.""

Quick tip: Don't accidentally call your boss a dog!

The Word You WANT to Say What Indians Often Say Why It Can Cause Trouble The Quick Fix! Qalb (Heart) Kalb (Sounds like 'K'ite) In Arabic, your Qalb (with a deep, guttural 'Q') is your heart. But if you say it with a soft 'K,' you've just said Kalb—which means Dog! Say the 'Q' from the very back of your throat. Think of it as a deep, rough 'K'. Khubz (Bread) Kubz (Skipping the 'kh') Khubz is the delicious local flatbread. If you drop the throat sound ('kh'), native speakers might not understand you. The 'kh' sound is like gently clearing your throat. Practice saying 'Kha-liji' (for the Gulf) to get the sound right! Ḥāl (Condition/State) Haal (Too much breath) You use this word for the universal greeting: Kayfa Ḥalak? (How are you?). The Arabic Ḥā’ (ح) is a soft, compressed 'h' sound. Keep your 'h' quiet and smooth. It's not a big, loud English 'H.' Marḥaba (Hello) Mar-HAA-baaa! (Too stressed) We tend to over-emphasize the middle or end of words. Marhaba is a smooth, flowing word. Don't shout! Say it smoothly and evenly. Keep the rhythm flat and friendly, not dramatic.

How trade, culture, and Islam shaped Arabic words in India

From Hal to Waqt: The twin words that bind the dialects

Crossover Word (Hindi/Urdu) Arabic Origin Meaning How it Influences the GCC Dialect Waqt (वक़्त) Waqt (وقت) Time When an Indian asks, ""Kitna waqt?"" (How much time?), an Arab often understands the concept instantly, even if the phrasing isn't Modern Standard Arabic. It’s a shared time-teller. Hal (हाल) Hāl (حال) Condition/State Both languages use this word to ask about well-being. The classic Arabic greeting Kayfa Halak? (How are you?) sounds familiar because of the Hindi/Urdu word for 'condition'. Sahi (सही) Sahīh (صحيح) Correct/Right A simple, powerful affirmative. When an Indian says, ""Sahi baat"" (Correct point), the word itself is instantly recognized by an Arab speaker as meaning ""true"" or ""right."" Qalam (क़लम) Qalam (قلم) Pen Whether you're in a Dubai office or a Mumbai school, the object used for writing is often called qalam. This shared administrative vocabulary is a direct historical link. Amir (अमीर) Amīr (أمير) Rich/Wealthy (or Prince) In Arabic, it means ""prince"" or ""commander."" In Hindi/Urdu, it evolved to mean ""rich."" The shared root confirms a concept of power and status familiar to both cultures.







When you live and work in the Gulf, a few Arabic words sneak into your vocabulary even if you don’t speak Arabic fluently. Words like yalla, inshallah, habibi, khalas and mashallah turn up in shops, on construction sites, in offices and family chats. These words are so common that they become part of everyday speech for many Indians living in the GCC.Let's explore some Arabic words that have become an integral part of the daily conversations of Indians in the Gulf:These words not only enrich the language but also reflect the deep cultural integration between Arabs and Indians in the Gulf.If you're an Indian expat, you've probably nailed the everyday Arabic phrases. But sometimes, those deep Arabic sounds don't exist in Hindi, and our desi pronunciation can land us in hilarious, or awkward, trouble.Here are a few quick tips to save you from mixing up your greetings, your heart, and the nearest canine:The linguistic connection between India and the Arab world stretches back over a millennium, shaped by centuries of trade, cultural exchange, and religious interaction. Arab traders frequented India’s coastal regions, especially Kerala, Gujarat, and the Konkan coast, drawn by spices, textiles, and other valuable goods.Over time, these interactions introduced Arabic vocabulary into Indian languages, while the establishment of communities like the Mappilas in Kerala reflected deeper cultural and linguistic blending. The spread of Islam further cemented Arabic’s influence, as it became the liturgical language and contributed words and expressions to Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam, and Gujarati.In the modern era, particularly after the 1970s Gulf oil boom, large-scale migration of Indian workers to countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman strengthened these linguistic ties. Daily life in the Gulf exposed Indians to Arabic phrases, which gradually merged with their native languages. Today, words like “yalla” (let’s go), “habibi” (my dear), and “inshallah” (God willing) are part of everyday conversations, reflecting centuries of cultural interaction and the ongoing evolution of language in a shared, multicultural space.The most mind-boggling part of the Arabic-Indian linguistic crossover isn't the phrases learned in the Gulf, but the common words that Indians have unknowingly carried from the subcontinent. These ""twin words"" sound almost identical in Hindi/Urdu and Arabic, effortlessly bridging the communication gap and showing how deep the roots of their shared vocabulary go.This linguistic comfort zone means Indian expats often don't need a translator for core concepts, as these words have been an integral part of Indian languages for centuries, mainly filtered through Persian.When in doubt, remember that the Arabic language uses the back of the throat far more than Hindi. A little guttural effort can save your heart from becoming a dog! The linguistic and cultural ties between India and the Arab world are profound and multifaceted. From ancient trade routes to modern migration, these connections have enriched both cultures. For Indians in the Gulf, incorporating Arabic words into daily conversations is a testament to this enduring relationship. Embracing the Arabic language can further enhance these connections, fostering greater understanding and appreciation of the shared history and culture.","How trade, culture, and Islam shaped Arabic words in India.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

“He's the one who actually designed and built the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.

If there's anyone who is probably going to be able to bring that dimension to the LLM, in this case OpenAI, it's probably going to be Jony Ive, working with Sam Altman.”

What ex-Apple CEO said about the company’s position in AI race



“the first real competitor”

“in many decades.”

“AI has not been a particular strength for them,”

“In the agentic era, we don't need a lot of apps; it can all be done with smart agents,”

“When we had apps at the centre of everything, it was selling tools, selling products. When you think of subscription, it's about people paying for something as long as they need it,”





Former Apple CEO John Sculley has expressed confidence in the AI-hardware devices being developed by former Apple design chief Jony Ive in partnership with OpenAI . Speaking at the Zeta Live conference, Sculley pointed to Ive's design history as an indicator of future success with the new devices. Talking about Ives, Sculley said:OpenAI recently acquired Jony Ive’s device startup for more than $6 billion. At OpenAI's DevDay conference this week, Ive stated that the hardware his team is developing aims to address some of the issues that smartphones and tablets have created since their launch. The partnership seeks to combine Ive’s hardware design experience with OpenAI’s large language model (LLM) technology.At the conference, Sculley also noted Apple is encountering a significant new competitor in the age of AI. He described OpenAI asApple has hadSculley said about Apple. The company also appears to have fallen behind in the AI race, with fewer consistent product updates compared to firms like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Meta.It has also faced setbacks, such as delays in revamping its AI-powered assistant Siri earlier this year.Sculley said, referring to AI capable of autonomously performing complex tasks.Sculley added. According to him, subscriptions provide a stronger business model.Sculley also commented on reports suggesting that Apple's current CEO, Tim Cook, may be considering retirement.

Fastrack MYND: The AI Smartwatch That Knows You





The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced that it is investigating how Tesla's semi-autonomous driving software handles railroad crossings as part of a wide-ranging probe into incidents where the agency said Tesla vehicles have violated traffic safety laws. NHTSA said it launched the investigation of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after receiving complaints from drivers, including reports of vehicles driving through red lights or on the wrong side of the road. The agency said the investigation covers all Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD—approximately 2.9 million vehicles.The agency said its investigation would examine the software’s performance at railroad crossings, which was the subject of an NBC News investigation published in September.“While the behaviors under investigation appear to occur most frequently at intersections, NHTSA's investigation will encompass any other types of situations in which this behavior may arise, such as when traveling adjacent to a lane of opposing traffic or when approaching railroad crossings,” NHTSA said in a three-page summary, as per NBCNews.NBC News says that it has been found that Tesla vehicles using the FSD software sometimes fail to stop for train tracks or otherwise mishandle situations at rail crossings, including when red lights are flashing and gate arms are lowering, according to Tesla drivers and videos they've taken.NHTSA said it would examine whether the system gives drivers enough time to respond to FSD errors. The agency said that in some reported incidents, a Tesla vehicle provided “little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene.”Meanwhile, Elon Musk has posted and reshared a bunch of tweets on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that suggest that the FSD is safe.For example, he reshared a post that said, “FSD v14.1 drives me over an hour through LA rush hour traffic without any human input.

What Martinet said about candidates who use AI while applying for jobs



“As AI reshapes how we communicate, market, and create, those who pair creative skills with AI fluency will have a competitive edge, and we’re looking for that combination.

[If] someone comes to me and they’re like, ‘Hey, I made you this content for your social media channels, and I used AI as part of this.’ I would say, ‘That’s excellent. If it’s, ‘Hey, I’m interviewing for a communications job, and I did a first draft, and then I ran it through AI, and it suggested some tweaks,’ I think that would be excellent.

”

“If someone hasn’t used [AI], it’s not a hard ‘no,’ but they’re going to have to use it in their job, and so the sooner they can embrace it, the better. Because that’s what we’re doing—it’s here and it’s changing how we work,”

“What are the new things that are unlocked from this technology that we haven’t even dreamed of yet? The people who dream that up are creating the future around this,





Adobe’s chief communications officer, Stacy Martinet, is actively seeking job candidates who demonstrate their skills by using artificial intelligence (AI) tools during the application and interview process. While many hiring managers are concerned about applicants using AI to create generic cover letters, the Adobe executive values prospective hires who go beyond listing AI skills on a resume and instead use the technology to enhance their assignments or projects. Martinet said she appreciates candidates who showcase their human capabilities alongside AI tools during interview rounds that include tests or mini-projects. This combination of human skill and AI technology reflects the blend of capabilities the software company is seeking in its new talent pool. The use of AI in application rounds is seen as a way to produce content at scale, turning the job hunt into a numbers game for many applicants.In a statement to Fortune, Martinet said:However, for those aiming to work at Adobe, limited AI experience does not automatically disqualify them. Martinet notes that while a lack of AI expertise is not a dealbreaker, candidates will need to engage with the technology once they join the company actively. She adds that future success will likely depend on how effectively individuals integrate AI tools into their professional work.Martinet added.The Adobe executive emphasised that adaptability is essential, adding that those who thrive will be the ones who make the most of evolving technology.” she explained.Apart from Adobe, AI startup Anthropic has also revised its hiring policy to let applicants use AI tools during the application process. Previously, its job listings included an “AI policy” that required candidates to explain why they wanted to work there and submit their cover letters.","Adobe’s chief communications officer, Stacy Martinet, is actively seeking job candidates who demonstrate their skills by using artificial intelligence (AI) tools during the application and interview process.

Time is running out for Windows 10 users. Microsoft's popular operating system officially reaches end-of-life status on October 14, 2025, meaning your PC will stop receiving critical security updates by default. While your computer will continue to function, it will become increasingly vulnerable to malware and security threats without these essential patches.The good news? Upgrading to Windows 11 is completely free if your computer meets the system requirements. Here's everything you need to know about making the switch before the deadline hits.Before attempting any upgrade, you need to verify whether your computer can run Windows 11. Not all Windows 10 computers can run Windows 11. Download Microsoft's PC Health Check app to confirm your device has TPM 2.0 support, Secure Boot enabled, and a compatible processor.If your computer qualifies, you'll see a confirmation message. If not, you'll need to explore alternative options like Extended Security Updates or consider purchasing a new device.Before you begin the upgrade process, keep these critical points in mind to ensure a smooth transition:If your computer passes the compatibility check and meets all Windows 11 system requirements, you can proceed with the upgrade using any of the three free methods outlined below.Each method is legitimate and provided directly by Microsoft, so choose the one that best suits your technical comfort level and needs.This is the easiest method for most users with compatible PCs.Your personal files, apps, and settings will be preserved during this upgrade process.If Windows 11 isn't appearing as an available update, Microsoft's Installation Assistant provides an alternative path.This method is particularly useful if you want to upgrade multiple computers or prefer having physical installation media.If your computer doesn't qualify for Windows 11, you have options. Microsoft now offers free Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 10 users, giving you an additional year of security protection through October 2026.This buys you extra time to plan your next move, whether that's upgrading hardware, purchasing a new PC, or exploring alternatives like Chromebooks or Macs.The clock is ticking. With Windows 10 support ending tomorrow, now is the time to take action and secure your computer's future.","If your existing Windows 10 device meets the minimum requirements for Windows 11 and runs the latest version of Windows 10, it will be able to upgrade to Windows 11.

Ex-Apple CEO calls OpenAI as Apple’s ‘first real competitor’





Former Apple CEO John Sculley has confirmed that the current Apple CEO Tim Cook may be planning to retire soon. Speaking at the Zeta Live Conference in New York City last week, Sculley said that whoever replaces Tim Cook will need to help Apple transition from the apps era to the agentic era.John Sculley was Apple CEO from 1983 to 1993. During his tenure as CEO, Sculley has a tense relationship with Steve Jobs. It was during this period that Jobs left Apple before returning in 1997.Reports of Tim Cook stepping down from the CEO role have increased over the past few months. In a recent edition of the weekly Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said that hardware engineering chief John Ternus is positioned as the leading candidate to replace him.Bloomberg's Gurman reports that Apple's PR and marketing teams have increasingly spotlighted Ternus, who recently introduced the iPhone Air and led customer events at Apple's Regent Street store in London, a ceremonial role Cook previously filled.During the interaction, Sculley criticized Apple’s AI growth, stating that “AI has not been a particular strength for them (Apple).” He goes on to call ChatGPT-maker OpenAI as the company’s “first real competitor” in decades.""When we had apps at the center of everything, it was selling tools, selling products,"" Sculley said. He further added that “In the agentic era, we don't need a lot of apps, it can all be done with smart agents”.“When you think of subscription, it's about people paying for something as long as they need it,” he continued, emphasizing that subscriptions offer a much better business model.","Former Apple CEO John Sculley has confirmed that Tim Cook may be planning to retire soon.

Apple working on H3 Chip for next AirPods Pro; AirPods 5 also in development,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-working-on-h3-chip-for-next-airpods-pro-airpods-5-also-in-development/articleshow/124521473.cms,"

Future AirPods could get even more AI features





Just weeks after releasing the AirPods Pro 3, Apple has shifted focus to developing an even newer version of its pro earbuds, complete with an upgraded H3 chip and potential camera integration, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.In his Power On newsletter, Gurman revealed that Apple's silicon team is already working on the H3 chip, designed to deliver improved audio quality and reduced lag time. The new processor would represent a significant leap from the H2 chip currently powering both the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, which first debuted in 2022.Apple is also developing the AirPods 5, which will update both the entry-level and mid-tier models, Gurman reports. While the heart-rate sensor introduced in AirPods Pro 3 likely won't trickle down to these models, Apple plans to add several health features over time, including temperature sensing capabilities.The bigger focus, however, is transforming AirPods into AI-powered devices.Apple is exploring embedding cameras in the earbuds, building on analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's earlier prediction that at least one tiny infrared camera would arrive in 2026.These cameras could enable in-air gesture controls and deeper integration with the Vision Pro headset.The camera-equipped version may launch as a higher-end AirPods Pro 3 variant rather than a full AirPods Pro 4 redesign, similar to how AirPods 4 currently offers two configurations. This approach would mirror Apple's strategy of releasing iterative hardware updates without changing model numbers, as it did when adding USB-C to AirPods Pro 2.No specific timeline was provided for these developments, though previous reports suggested camera-equipped AirPods would debut in 2026. The H3 chip's arrival timeline also remains unclear, though it could potentially power the infrared camera features that require additional processing capabilities.","Apple is working on an upgraded H3 chip for AirPods, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.
