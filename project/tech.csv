"China inaugurates next-generation synchrotron, boasting world's brightest X-rays",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-inaugurates-next-generation-synchrotron-boasting-worlds-brightest-x-rays/articleshow/110124437.cms,"NEW DELHI: China's latest scientific milestone , the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), set to be the first fourth-generation synchrotron light source in Asia , will begin operations by the end of this year. Located approximately 50 kilometers from Beijing in Huairou, this 4.8-billion-yuan (US$665-million) facility promises to enhance scientific research with some of the brightest synchrotron X-rays globally.Pedro Fernandes Tavares, a physicist who leads the accelerator division at Sweden’s MAX IV Laboratory, remarked on the facility's capabilities .“It will certainly be a state-of-the-art installation that will cater for outstanding science,” he said. The HEPS is designed to accelerate electrons up to energies of 6 gigaelectron volts within its 1.36-kilometer circumference storage ring. This process will produce high-energy X-rays that can penetrate deep into samples, revealing intricate details at the nanometer scale, a report in journal Nature said.The HEPS will dramatically improve the time resolution of experiments, performing measurements in hundreds of nanoseconds compared to the milliseconds required by third-generation synchrotrons like the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. ""Its time resolution will be 10,000 times better than that achieved by third-generation synchrotrons,"" explained Ye Tao, a beamline scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) who works on HEPS.By 2025, the facility will offer 14 beamlines for a variety of experiments in fields ranging from biomedicine to condensed-matter physics, with plans to expand up to 90 beamlines. Tao described the potential impact of HEPS, stating it will ""impact every scientific field, except maths.""The powerful X-rays of HEPS are also expected to change how researchers study the atomic structure of proteins. Tavares highlighted the advancements, saying, “Older synchrotrons require large samples that are difficult to produce, making it nearly impossible to study smaller protein crystals. But HEPS’s hard X-rays will be powerful enough to analyze even the most minuscule samples in detail."" He added, “It’s a real game-changer.”HEPS is part of an elite group of fourth-generation synchrotrons, including Sweden’s MAX IV Laboratory, Sirius in Brazil, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility’s Extremely Brilliant Source in France, and the Advanced Photon Source in Illinois, USA. These facilities utilize multi-bend achromat lattice arrays to generate X-ray beams that are narrower and brighter than those produced by earlier generations, the Nature report said.As the facility nears completion, researchers are meticulously working to ensure the beam's stability for future scientific explorations. ""No beam is perfect at the beginning,"" mentioned Yuhui Li, a physicist at IHEP and deputy manager of HEPS, underscoring the ongoing adjustments needed to achieve operational precision.","China's High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) is set to be the first fourth- generation synchrotron light source in Asia.

Red flags: Be cautious of these warning signs

WhatsApp investment scams : Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money. They're creating fake investment groups , pretending to be famous brands and professionals, and offering phony stock tips and trading courses .According to ET, scamsters send group invitations to WhatsApp users, claiming to be from a well-known fund house.The messages promise free access to high-quality investment portfolios and daily stock recommendations as part of an online event celebrating the fund's anniversary in India.1. Victims are added to random WhatsApp investing groups.2. Multiple groups are created simultaneously.3. The profile of a famous investor and their credentials are shared with group members.4. Discussions begin in the group, with some members hyping up upcoming 'lessons' or 'opportunities'.5. Initial stock tips are shared for free, with conflicting tips shared in other groups.6. Some tips work in favor of certain groups, encouraging members to invest more.7. Less successful groups are abandoned.8. Active members are pushed to invest in special programs with promises of bigger rewards.9. If a victim refuses to invest more or tries to withdraw funds, their account is disabled, and the WhatsApp group is deactivated. Scammers vanish with the victims' funds.These scamsters employ a very common tactic to impersonate renowned fund managers, financial advisors , and influential figures within the finance community. By leveraging the identities of individuals like Porinju Veliyath and Ajay Kacholia, these fraudsters aim to lend an air of credibility to their operations, preying on investors' desire for lucrative stock tips, the financial daily’s report said.Santosh Joseph, Founder of Germinate Investor Services, was quoted as saying, “These scamsters prey on investors’ appetite for stock tips, particularly coming from star names.”They might pose as an investment academy or class, with a 'professor' or 'teacher' (often the impersonated individual). Discussions in group chats are often scripted, with members expressing excitement about upcoming opportunities or asking about the trading program. Usually, these active participants are affiliates who pretend to be genuine members, adding a false sense of legitimacy to the operation.Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged.in, says, “Messages planted by their own affiliates gives the entire set-up a feel of legitimacy.”Some scamsters even mention past trading successes under the 'teacher's' guidance, providing screenshots as evidence. This is to create a fear of missing out (FOMO) among unsuspecting members. They also create a sense of urgency by pushing a 'limited time opportunity' or warning of missing out on profitable trades. Another tactic is to offer investors a free 'trial' period to test the waters. Initial stock tips may be given for free to build confidence.Many of these scams operate as 'pump and dump' schemes. The scamsters or their associates convince people to buy stocks they already hold. They artificially inflate the stock price through circular trading. Once enough people buy, they sell their shares at a significant profit, causing the stock price to drop sharply. Other scams involve enticing people to transfer money in exchange for supposedly lucrative tips or recommendations. These tips are fake, so scammers create multiple investor groups, suggesting different ideas to each group.Ghose points out that different groups receive conflicting 'buy-sell' calls. Because some of these 'ideas' will succeed, members of those groups are pushed to invest more. Meanwhile, other groups are abandoned, and the cycle repeats.Investors should be cautious and watch for signs of fraud. If you receive a random invitation to join a trading community from unknown contacts, proceed with caution. Avoid falling for promises of quick wealth or guaranteed returns. As Santosh Joseph advises, ""Stay away from stock tips, no matter who shares them.""If an investing group claims affiliation with a trusted name or brand, verify its authenticity by reaching out to the person or company through social media or email, as recommended by Rahul Ghose. They're likely to identify any scam. Lastly, be wary of requests to send money through unverified links or download third-party apps, as these could be suspicious.","Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Scenario 1

Purchase transaction date: October 15, 2023

Refund on October 19, 2023, for the cancellation of the purchase made on October 15, 2023.

Since the bill has not been generated yet, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, will be adjusted with other debits before calculating the Total Amount Due.

Scenario 2

Purchase transaction date: October 29, 2023

Refund or reversal occurs after the bill is generated but before the payment due date (November 19, 2023).

The refund amount will be credited to the cardholder's account and will reduce the outstanding dues to be paid before the due date.

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

EPF members can stop automatic EPF account transfers



EPF automatic account transfer : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts . Despite its usefulness, this facility remains relatively unknown.As per an ET report, the automatic transfer simplifies the process for EPF members switching jobs , enabling them to seamlessly move their PF balances without the need for online or offline transfer requests.The transfer occurs automatically from the old employer to the new one, sparing members the hassle of managing the transfer themselves.Vaibhav Bhardwaj, a Partner at INDUSLAW, said that EPFO's automatic EPF account transfer has been operational since 2017.However, it's important to note that not all EPF members have access to the automatic transfer facility from old to new employers. It's only available for those whose EPF accounts are managed by EPFO. Exempted PF trusts are not included in this automatic transfer option.Gupta explains that if either the previous or current company operates a private provident fund trust, the auto-transfer feature will not function. A private PF trust oversees the provident fund contributions of employees within the respective company, rather than through the EPFO. However, it must still comply with EPFO regulations.Bhardwaj adds that EPF members transferring their old EPF account to a new EPF account, whether from EPF to an exempted trust or vice versa, or between exempted trusts, will need to apply for transfer using Form 13, either online or offline.The EPFO has set specific requirements for automatic EPF account transfers from old to new employers. These conditions, outlined in a November 2017 circular, include:(i) Matching UAN and Aadhaar numbers provided by the new employer with existing details in the UAN.(ii) Aadhaar number of the EPF member must be linked and verified with the UAN at their previous workplace.(iii) Availability of EPF member's details such as date of joining, date of exit, and reason for exit from the old employer.(iv) Activation of EPF member's UAN, with a registered mobile number.Bhardwaj further explains that when an employee starts a new job and receives their first month's provident fund contribution from the new employer, an automatic transfer is activated. This triggers the transfer of the EPF member's previous provident fund dues to their new account.Once the process is triggered, an SMS and email notification inform the member about the initiation of the auto transfer.Sandeep Agrawal, Director and Co-Founder of Teamlease Regtech, said that for automatic transfer claims, there's no requirement to submit Form 13. However, if the automatic transfer doesn't occur within the specified time due to issues like mismatched dates of exit, not updated exit dates by a previous employer, member details mismatch, or pending UAN Aadhaar seeding, members can opt for online Form 13 to transfer EPF and EPS accumulation from the previous employer to the present one.Once an EPF member receives SMS and email notifications regarding the auto transfer of their EPF account, they should verify if the transfer has been successful.Puneet Gupta, Partner at People Advisory Services EY India, mentions that the auto transfer process will only be finalized if the member doesn't request to stop it within 10 days of receiving the notification, either online, through the employer, or at the nearest EPFO office. Additionally, the transfer will be completed after the first contribution from the new employer is deposited and reconciled.The automatic EPF transfer follows a similar process to manual requests. Experts suggest that it may take 2-3 weeks for the automatic transfer to complete.Sandeep Agrawal adds that members can confirm the transfer by checking their passbooks. By logging into the unified portal and navigating to 'View Passbook,' members can see a credit entry if their PF has been successfully transferred.EPF members have the option to halt automatic transfers if they prefer. They can do so within 10 days of receiving the SMS notification about the auto transfer initiation. This can be done online via the Member e-Sewa portal or offline through their current employer or by visiting the nearest EPFO office.Gupta has mentioned the steps for stopping the automatic transfer online:1. Log in to the EPFO Member portal.2. Navigate to the ""Online services"" tab and select ""Track claim status.""3. Choose the option ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases.""If the auto transfer request has been triggered, it will appear under ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases,"" providing the option to halt the transfer. After stopping the EPF transfer, the member will receive communication via SMS to the mobile number linked to the UAN and the registered email address.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts. The transfer occurs automatically from the old employer to the new one, sparing members the hassle of managing the transfer themselves. Not all EPF members have access to the automatic transfer facility from old to new employers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109198621,imgsize-49776,width-400,resizemode-4/109198621.jpg"

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

GPT-4o gives us a glimpse into an amazing future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gpt-4o-gives-us-a-glimpse-into-an-amazing-future/articleshow/110131821.cms,"A translator, a teacher, eyes for the visually impaired, a work assistant, a tour guide, a virtual friend who’s always sarcastic – OpenAI ’s latest AI model, showcased earlier this week, has given us a glimpse into the different roles AI systems will embody in the future.Called GPT-4o , it will be free for all users and will be rolled out in the next few weeks, with some capabilities already available on ChatGPT.The ‘o’ stands for omni because the model can reason across audio, vision, and text, and this, Bebi Negi, senior lead data scientist at Happiest Minds Technologies, says, is a gamechanger.“Think about it: you could provide a spoken description and receive an image, or give the model text instructions and get a video response. This multimodal approach makes interaction much more natural and intuitive,” she says.The new model’s availability through ChatGPT will also democratise access to these AI advancements, says Bhavesh Goswami, founder and CEO of CloudThat. “Especially for developers who can leverage enhanced APIs to fully harness GPT-4o’s capabilities.”Aditya Garg, head of solutions consulting at Genesys India, says this leap in AI capabilities represents a big change for some industries – like call centres. He says the integration of models like GPT-4o into cloudbased contact centre solutions will drive significant efficiency gains through automation and reduce the need for human intervention in routine tasks.Deepak Visweswaraiah, VP of platform engineering at Pegasystems India, says the exponential growth in compute power and the abundance of data have fuelled the progress of AI models, while Aakash Bist, who leads GenAI R&D at Pure Storage, says the quality of data, data utilisation techniques, and refined feedback mechanisms have also contributed to progress in AI functionalities.","GPT-4o will be free for all users and will be rolled out in the next few weeks.

How IT companies are pressing staff to return to office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-it-companies-are-pressing-staff-to-return-to-office/articleshow/110130775.cms,"BENGALURU: Some IT companies wield the stick, while others offer carrots.Tech companies are employing different strategies to encourage their workforce to return to the office. The unprecedented flexibility that employees enjoyed during the pandemic is now being scaled back as companies reassert their expectations and exert control over the work environment.Employees find themselves in a challenging position, with no option but to comply with these directives or potentially face repercussions for non-compliance.Earlier this year, Cognizant's CEO, Ravi Kumar, announced the development of a new app that will enable managers to create a roster based on requirements, in addition to the existing FlexiSeat app for booking seats across its facilities. This application will allow the company to monitor work-from-office compliance . In a memo, Kumar had stated, ""Our collective goal is to ensure that we are in the office with a purpose."" He also mentioned that employees are expected to come to office three times a week or as defined by their leader. In fact, Cognizant has embarked on the NextGen programme aimed at simplifying its operating model and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic hybrid work environment. An email sent to Cognizant on the new app rollout didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press.TCS has implemented a policy that links the amount of variable pay employees receive each quarter to their presence in office. Employees who work from office less than 60% of the time will not receive any variable pay, while those with an office attendance between 60-75% will receive 50% of the variable pay. Employees who come to office 75-85% of the time will be eligible for 75% of the variable pay, and only those with an office compliance level above 85% will receive full variable pay for the quarter.Dell Technologies plans to use electronic badge swipes, VPN, and a colour-coding system to track employee presence. The four colours used are blue (consistent on-site presence), green (regular on-site presence), yellow (some on-site presence), and red (limited on-site presence). Tech chronicler The Register was the first to report the development. Dell has a significant presence in India but does not disclose the exact number of employees in the country.In contrast, Wipro has taken a milder approach. In a recent letter to employees, its chief human resources officer Saurabh Govil stated that local-level councils have been set up to ""enhance associate participation, engagement, collaboration, and networking"". Govil informed employees that there would be more in-office activities to encourage people to work from Wipro campuses across India.Infosys's employee experience platform, InfyMe, allows employees from select business units to apply for work-from-home for 11 days in a month. Last year, Infosys had asked select employees at the junior and mid-levels to return to office ten days a month starting Nov 20, deviating from some of its peers who are enforcing a five-day work week.","Tech companies are employing different strategies to encourage their workforce to return to the office.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

The multimodal capabilities should arrive later this year on Pixel phones.Gemini Nano will power new features such as Dynamic Suggestions, which will provide users with relevant suggestions based on the content displayed on their screen.The Gemini app, which is replacing Google Assistant on Android, is set to become more context-aware and integrated with other Google apps. Users will soon be able to access the Gemini overlay while using other apps, allowing them to seamlessly use AI features without switching between apps.If you watch a lot of YouTube, then there’s a new “Ask this video” button, which will bring up the Gemini overlay and help you with questions relevant to the video. There’s also an ""Ask this PDF"" feature, which will be introduced for Gemini Advanced subscribers. As the name implies, the feature will let users get answers from documents without having to go through all the pages.With Gemini, users could not only create AI-generated images but also drag and drop them into Gmail, Google Messages, and other apps.Additionally, Gemini Nano will enhance the TalkBack feature, generating rich descriptions for unlabeled images without requiring an internet connection. This improvement will make Android devices more accessible to users with visual impairments.Google is leveraging Gemini Nano to introduce a new scam detection feature to analyse real-time phone conversations. The AI will alert users if it detects patterns commonly associated with scams, such as requests for personal information or urgent fund transfers. This opt-in feature will operate entirely on-device, ensuring user privacy.Google's Circle to Search feature, which allows users to search for anything on their phone using a simple gesture, has been updated to assist students with homework. Starting today, students can circle a physics or maths problem they're struggling with, and Circle to Search will provide step-by-step instructions to solve it without the need to leave the current app.Later this year, Google's LearnLM initiative will power the feature, which will expand to handle more complex problems involving formulas, diagrams, and graphs.The updated Gemini app , the multimodal Gemini Nano model, and the other features will be rolled out to supported Android phones, which Google says are around hundreds of millions, over the next few months.","Gemini app will be more context-aware and integrated with other Google apps.

Google I/O 2024: Google’s Gemini AI will soon detect spam calls on Android phones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-i/o-2024-googles-gemini-ai-will-soon-detect-spam-calls-on-android-phones/articleshow/110126493.cms,"Google is putting its artificial intelligence at work to detect and warn users about potential phone scams in real time. The feature will be built into a future version of the Android operating system. It should come out later this year with the upcoming Android 15.The feature uses Gemini Nano , the smallest version of Google's Generative AI that runs entirely on the user's device, ensuring privacy.The AI analyses conversation patterns often associated with scams and alerts users if they suspect they are talking to a scammer.The AI will look for red flags, such as callers pretending to be bank representatives asking for sensitive information like passwords or PINs, requesting gift card payments, or pressuring users to transfer money immediately. When the AI detects these suspicious patterns, it will show a notification on the user's device, allowing them to decide whether to continue or end the call.While the feature could help protect many users from falling for scams, its availability may be limited at first. Considering that Gemini Nano only works on the Google Pixel 8 Pro and Samsung S24 series, the feature should remain limited to these phones and the others getting support in the future.Google says that users will have to choose to turn on the scam detection feature, so the users won’t have to worry much about the AI listening to their calls.The company is still testing this feature and will have more to tell us later this summer, most probably when the Android 15 nears the stable rollout.","The feature will be built into a future version of the Android operating system.

AI summaries will understand complex questions

Search with videos

Google Search can now research, plan and brainstorm on users’ behalf with generative AI , the company said at its annual Google I/O 2024 conference. Google is infusing a custom Gemini AI model that will bring together Gemini’s capabilities — including multi-step reasoning, planning and multimodality — to its Search systems.Search is now offering AI Overviews, a feature that automatically generates concise summaries of topics directly within search results.This eliminates the need to gather information from multiple sources. AI Overviews will be rolled out to all users in the US this week, ultimately reaching over a billion users globally by year-end.Google says that links presented within AI Overviews receive more clicks compared to traditional search results. It also highlighted that ads will continue to be clearly labelled and displayed in dedicated sections.Soon, users will have the option to customise their AI Overviews, including the ability to simplify the language or expand the details provided. On desktops, users will be able to choose from ""Original,"" ""Simpler,"" and ""Break It Down"" options within the AI Overview section.The AI Overview in Google Search will be able to handle complex questions with all specific needs and considerations in one go. For example, when searching for a yoga studio, users can ask the Search to suggest a place that is popular with locals, have a convenient commute from their location, and offer a new member discount.Also, it will soon assist users with planning, starting with meals and vacations. Search will soon categorise AI-generated results pages findings under creative AI-crafted headlines. This feature will initially launch for US users searching for dining and recipe inspiration (English searches).Search is also getting advancements in video understanding for visual search. Users can point their smartphone camera at an object or action, and ask a question. Video search functionality will debut in US Search Labs (English queries) and expand to additional regions over time.","Search is now offering AI Overviews, a feature that automatically generates concise summaries of topics directly within search results.

Additionally, Imagen 3 is claimed to demonstrate increased proficiency in managing details extracted from complex or lengthy prompts.Earlier this year, Google paused the image generation capabilities in the Gemini AI chatbot after it generated factually incorrect images. Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai also said that the company is developing the feature from the ground up and fixing the issues.It is yet to be seen how good Imagen 3 is, especially when its performance in terms of handling text prompts and results is compared to competitor Dall-E 3.Apart from the updated text-to-image AI model, the company also announced Veo – a text-to-video AI model that can generate videos based on text prompts – just like OpenAI’s Sora.Veo can produce “high-quality” 1080p videos with “an advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics.” The AI generated videos can last “beyond a minute” and the model is said to be capable of understanding cinematic and visual techniques, such as timelapse.Google has partnered with Donald Glover and Gilga, his creative studio, for the model's capabilities. Google is also working with artists like Wyclef Jean and Bjorn to test out its Music AI Sandbox – a bunch of tools that can help users produce songs and beats.","Google announces Imagen-3, an upgrade to its text-to-image creation model.

How GPT-4o is ""more human than ever""

OpenAI has announced a significant update to its popular ChatGPT platform. This update introduces GPT-4o , a powerful new AI model that brings ""GPT-4-class chat"" to the app. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati and OpenAI employees showcased their newest flagship model, capable of real-time verbal conversations with a friendly AI chatbot that can speak like a human.OpenAI’s announcement comes just a day before the Google's annual developers conference -- Google I/O.“GPT-4o provides GPT-4 level intelligence but is much faster,” Murati said on stage. “We think GPT-4o is really shifting that paradigm into the future of collaboration, where this interaction becomes much more natural and far easier.”In GPT-4o — the ""o"" stands for omni -- combines voice, text and vision into a single model, allowing it to be faster than its predecessor. The company said that the new model is two times faster and significantly more efficient.OpenAI CTO Mira Murati said in a livestream announcement on Monday. It’ll be free for all users, and paid users will continue to “have up to five times the capacity limits” of free users, Murati added at the launch event in San Francisco. The update brings a number of features to free users that so far have been limited to those with a paid subscription to ChatGPT. These include the ability to search the web for answers to queries, speak to the chatbot and hear responses in various voices, and command it to store details that the chatbot can recall in the future. OpenAI is beginning to roll out GPT-4o’s new text and image capabilities to some paying ChatGPT Plus and Team users today, and is offering those capabilities to enterprise users soon. The company will make the new version of its “voice mode” assistant available to ChatGPT Plus users in the coming weeks.GPT-4o goes beyond traditional text-based communication and can now ""see"" the world around it through vision capabilities. These capabilities include:* Desktop screenshots: GPT-4o can analyse screenshots taken directly on your Mac.* Mobile app integration: An iPhone app (with a Windows app coming soon) allows uploading videos and screenshots for GPT-4o to process.The OpenAI demo mainly featured the company's employees asking questions to the voiced ChatGPT, which responded with jokes and human-like banter.* Real-time interaction: Unlike previous models, GPT-4o allows for back-and-forth conversation without waiting for the model to finish its statement.* Harmonised speech synthesis: GPT-4o can generate different voices and even harmonise them for a more natural dialogue experience.* Sophisticated conversations: GPT-4o offers ""normal"" conversational interactions, translations, and more, all with the sophistication expected from GPT-4 level technology.","GPT-4o combines voice, text and vision into a single model.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4 new camera features Apple may add to iPhone 16 Pro models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/4-new-camera-features-apple-may-add-to-iphone-16-pro-models/articleshow/110057298.cms,"Upgraded ultra-wide cameras



Tetra-prism lens for iPhone 16 Pro



Improved lens flare control



New Sony primary sensor for improved low-light photography



Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September. The upcoming lineup may include four smartphone models -- the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Pro variants in the upcoming iPhone lineup are rumoured to bring new features like larger displays, a dedicated Capture button and more.According to a recent report by 9to5Mac, the Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to add multiple noticeable improvements to the camera hardware of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Here are four new camera upgrades that may arrive with iPhone 16 Pro smartphones:Rumours suggest the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an upgraded 48MP Ultra Wide camera this year. This is expected to be a major improvement from the current 12 MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 15 Pro models.This upgrade is expected to offer improved performance in various shooting scenarios, particularly in low-light conditions. Images captured with the new Ultra-Wide camera are likely to show greater details and enhanced colour accuracy. The higher resolution will also provide increased flexibility during editing and post-processing.Furthermore, the 48MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 16 Pro may also lead to significant advancements in spatial video recording. This feature, which utilises both the Main and Ultra Wide lenses, may enable the iPhone 16 Pro to record spatial video in 4K resolution. To compare, the iPhone 15 Pro is limited to recording spatial video at 1080p resolution.The current iPhone 15 Pro Max features a new tetra-prism camera design which offers 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom capabilities. With the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to extend this upgraded tetra-prism camera to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro model as well. This means both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will offer at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.Rumours also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might feature a “periscope ultra-long telephoto combination.” This technology could potentially enable optical zoom greater than 5x.A common issue faced by most iPhone users is capturing lens flare while shooting in bright lighting conditions. This results in unexpected artefacts and internal reflections showing on images. While this problem is prevalent across most cameras on the market, Apple is reportedly working on a solution for the iPhone 16 Pro.According to rumours, Apple is testing a new ""atomic layer deposition"" (ALD) lens coating technology for the iPhone 16 Pro models. This anti-reflective coating could be applied to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera lenses to reduce the impact of internal reflections.If this rumour is true, users can expect fewer unexpected artefacts in images captured with the iPhone 16 Pro, particularly in bright lighting scenarios.The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a new main camera sensor from Sony, which is designed to improve low-light performance.As per the report, Sony's latest stacked sensor technology separates the photodiodes and pixel transistors (which are usually combined into a single layer). This separation will allow the photodiodes responsible for capturing light to be significantly larger within the same overall pixel size.Sony claims that this new sensor will capture twice as much light as existing camera sensors. The increased light capture and reduced noise are expected to offer improved photos for iPhone users in all conditions.However, it remains uncertain whether this next-generation Sony sensor will be utilised in both iPhone 16 Pro models. A tipster on the Chinese social media platform Weibo suggested that only the iPhone 16 Pro Max may feature this upgraded stacked camera sensor hardware.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months.From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
