Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes

NEW DELHI: According to Sun Tzu's ‘The Art of War’, “all warfare is based on deception.”In the wake of the Pakistan conflict in May when the enemy forces attempted to target Indian military assets like air defence systems, including Russia-imported S400 Triumf missile system, with their missiles and drones, India’s elite R&D wing Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has transferred two key indigenous technologies to the Army that will help its soldiers and their military equipment evade enemy detection.Defence Laboratory, Jodhpur (DLJ), DRDO, handed over Camouflage Pattern Generation Software Sigma 4.0 (CPGSS4.0) and a full-scale Multispectral Signature Tank Mock-up to the Indian Army’s Corps of Military Engineering (CME) in Pune in the first week of December.“CPGSS4.0 was launched today (Dec 3) by Lt Gen A K Ramesh, SM, Comdt CME in the presence of V S Shenoi, Director, DLJ and will be available for use by tri-services,” DRDO recently posted on X.“A full scale multispectral signature tank mock-up will be use (sic) for training the service personnel in camouflaging and deception technology,” it stated.CPGS 4.0 is an advanced software developed to create highly effective, multi-spectral camouflage patterns for military equipment, helping soldiers blend into diverse terrains by countering detection across visible light, infrared (IR), and radar sensors, thereby significantly boosting battlefield deception and survival training for the Indian Army.Whereas a multispectral signature tank mock-up is a full-scale, realistic decoy of a battle tank, designed not just to look like a tank in visible light, but to mimic its physical and electromagnetic properties (heat, radar reflection) across various sensor spectrums, allowing soldiers to test and train with advanced camouflage materials to hide tanks from modern threats like thermal, infrared and radar detection.Developing multispectral deception capabilities is the need of the hour as traditional camouflage measures have become less effective in modern warfare.These advanced systems are designed to enhance the Army’s capabilities in camouflage and deception, which are key for survival on modern battlefields where surveillance and sensor technologies are fast advancing.The integration of sophisticated software with a realistic mock-up helps tackle challenges posed by modern detection systems, including thermal imaging, UAV reconnaissance and radar technologies.With the introduction of these technologies, the Army now has the capacity to indulge in concealment methods more effectively, thereby enhancing operational survivability.",India's elite R&D wing Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has transferred two key indigenous technologies to the Army.

Arattai app gets end-to-end encryption







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon. We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform. In September this year, Arattai (meaning chat in Tamil) topped App Store ranking, registering 3,50,000 signs in just three days.Arattai offers familiar features such as:However, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.Last month, the company rolled out system-wide end-to-end encryption on the Arattai app. Announcing the release in an X post, Vembu then said that it is a “forced upgrade on all because it is a drastic change”.“We had to do some redesign around it and we wanted extensive testing because it is a drastic change. It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them. We are doing one more round of testing on a new build that has fixed the issues identified,” he then said.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Air inside classrooms, homes, and offices often goes unnoticed, even though it shapes daily health and comfort. A new system introduced in Abu Dhabi is set to change how indoor air is tracked, assessed, and managed across the emirate.The Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) has launched the Indoor Air Quality Observatory, known as HawAQM, representing a major step forward in monitoring indoor air pollutants and protecting public health. The system is designed to provide continuous, real-time data on indoor air quality in a variety of environments, ranging from schools and residential homes to offices and other indoor facilities.HawAQM relies on high precision sensors installed at selected locations throughout the emirate. These sophisticated devices monitor key indoor air pollutants constantly and transmit the information in real time. The collected data is displayed on a dedicated HawAQM dashboard, allowing specialists and decision-makers to quickly assess conditions and take timely action to maintain safe and healthy indoor environments.The observatory is part of a broader public health strategy led by ADPHC, reflecting a commitment to proactive health protection.By covering a wide range of indoor spaces, HawAQM ensures that both public and private facilities benefit from continuous monitoring. The system not only increases awareness of air quality but also enables experts to respond immediately when conditions require intervention, preventing potential health risks before they escalate.By combining advanced technology, precise analytics, and real-time monitoring, HawAQM strengthens oversight of indoor environments across Abu Dhabi.

There's a lot AI can do, but also a lot more that it can't. For instance, it can not predict or stop blackmailing and extortion, which, is still in the hands of the law. Case in point is a recent incident faced by Varun Vummadi, an Indian-origin co-founder and CEO of Giga, an AI startup.The San Francisco-based company is allegedly being targeted by an extortion scheme. Vummadi took to X to share the details of the incident, explaining that a small group of individuals have obtained confidential company information illegally and is using it to extort $3 million in cryptocurrency. He also shared a screenshot of the email, which threatened to release manipulated data and false allegations unless the demand was met.""They have already posted information on Twitter that is false and defamatory, and now they are threatening to take snippets of this data, manipulate it out of context, and release it to the public with wildly false and defamatory allegations unless we wire $3M to an anonymous crypto account,"" wrote Vummadi in the X post.Many under the post questioned the presence of information that the company could be blackmailed with.""Why would there be data that you guys could be extorted by?"" wrote one X user. ""Why would you draw more undue attention to yourself bro, scrutiny has not served yall well"" added another.Previously, former employees of the company, including a former staffer named Jared Steele have publicly accused the AI startup of various unethical practices like falsifying revenue numbers, bribing Fortune 500 companies and mistreating employees.Steele who was hired to lead demand generation, claimed that the work environment was ""most toxic"" he had experienced.

Dubai new e-scooter safety rules: What riders must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-new-e-scooter-safety-rules-what-riders-must-know/articleshow/126184645.cms,"Dubai tightens e-scooter safety rules across public roads / Image: File

RTA ’s key e-scooter safety rules

Riders must follow posted speed limits and stay in designated scooter or shared lanes.

Wearing helmets and bright or reflective clothing is strongly advised to stay visible.

Scooters should maintain a safe distance from pedestrians, bicycles, and other riders.

Clear new guidelines

E-scooters must be clean, dry, and folded before boarding public transport vehicles.

They can only be stored in designated areas and must be securely immobilized during travel.

A maximum of two scooters per journey is allowed to avoid crowding and obstruction.

Certain modes, like intercity buses, prohibit e-scooters altogether.



Penalties





Dubai is moving faster toward a greener future, and e-scooters have become the star of the show. Whether you’re zipping through Dubai Marina or using a scooter to bridge the gap between your home and the office, these nimble vehicles are everywhere. However, as their popularity has surged, so has the need for clear, common-sense rules.The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly. Officials say the changes reflect the city’s commitment to safe, orderly mobility, whether you’re riding a scooter, hopping on a metro, or walking down a busy street.The RTA has been actively reminding residents and visitors about essential safety guidelines as e-scooter use grows. These rules help reduce accidents and ensure everyone shares the roads and paths responsibly:The RTA has stressed that safe riding is a shared responsibility between riders and all road users. Taking personal precautions, obeying traffic rules, and being aware of surroundings help prevent incidents as e-scooter trips become part of daily life.One of the most practical changes affects how scooters interact with Dubai’s mass transit system. The RTA has outlined eight safety requirements for carrying e-scooters on public transport such as buses, designed to protect passengers and streamline boarding:These rules reinforce that while scooters are a flexible transport mode, they must be carried responsibly when combined with buses or other services to ensure safety for everyone on board.Dubai isn’t just reminding riders of rules; authorities are backing them with clear penalties to reinforce compliance. According to official summaries of RTA and Dubai Police enforcement, Riding without a permit or outside designated zones can lead to fines of about Dhs200–Dhs300.Not wearing a helmet, riding on jog or pedestrian paths, or ignoring speed limits carries fines. Riding dangerously, like against traffic, or parking scooters in unsafe spots can be penalized as well.These fines are part of a broader effort to keep micro-mobility safe without limiting access. Authorities note that proper permits, gear, and adherence to rules help riders enjoy scooters while minimising risks to others.E-scooters have become a visible symbol of micro-mobility in Dubai, popular for short journeys, last-mile connectivity, and easy travel between public transport stops. Yet, as their numbers rise, so do safety conversations.Recent community actions, such as e-scooter bans in some park areas and restrictions in crowded urban plazas, reflect the city’s careful balancing act between freedom of movement and public safety.As the RTA continues refining regulations and promoting awareness campaigns, officials emphasise that courtesy, caution, and compliance will make Dubai’s shared roads safer for riders, pedestrians, and commuters alike.","The aim of the new rules is simple: protect riders, pedestrians, and commuters while keeping Dubai’s transport network running smoothly.

Kuwait’s new energy drink rules

Age Restriction: You must be 18 or older to purchase an energy drink.

Daily Limit: Sales are capped at a maximum of two cans per person per day.

Caffeine Ceiling: Each can (250ml) is now legally restricted to a maximum of 80mg of caffeine, a move to prevent ""ultra-potent"" versions from hitting the market.

Warning Labels: Producers and importers must now feature clear, prominent health warnings on every single can.

Where you can and cannot buy?

All public and private schools, universities, and institutes.

All government offices and agencies.

Restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, food trucks, and even sports clubs.

Delivery platforms and online ordering apps are now barred from bringing these drinks to your doorstep.



Final take





As the world gears up for New Year celebrations, Kuwait is making a resolute resolution of its own: prioritizing the heart health of its citizens. In a sweeping move that has sent ripples through the local food and beverage industry, Minister of Health Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi has issued a ministerial decree that fundamentally changes how energy drinks are sold, advertised, and consumed across the nation.This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it is a comprehensive regulatory overhaul designed to curb the health risks, like heart palpitations and sleep disorders, that have been increasingly linked to high-caffeine lifestyles among the youth.Kuwait’s Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi, signed a ministerial decree with key rules on energy drinks:These rules are designed to discourage excessive consumption, particularly among adolescents and young adults who are seen as more vulnerable to the stimulant effects of caffeine-heavy drinks.The most striking part of the decree is the list of ""No-Go Zones."" Effective immediately, the sale and distribution of energy drinks are strictly prohibited in:By removing these drinks from everyday social spots, the government aims to decouple the ""fun"" of dining out or hanging with friends from the consumption of high-stimulant beverages.If you’re looking to stock up, your options are now limited to Cooperative Societies (Co-ops) and parallel markets.However, don't expect to find them next to the bread and milk. The decree mandates that these outlets must create ""designated areas"" for energy drinks, where sales will be under strict supervision to ensure age and quantity limits are followed to the letter.Kuwait’s energy drink rules are not a ban on the drinks themselves, but they are among the most comprehensive controls seen in the Gulf. By restricting sales to adults, limiting consumption, banning ads, and removing availability in common public places, the government is clearly prioritizing health, particularly that of younger residents.For consumers and businesses alike, this means adapting to new buying habits and greater awareness around what and how much they drink. Whether you’re a regular energy drink fan or a health-conscious reader curious about world policies, Kuwait’s decision offers a clear example of how governments can use regulation to shape everyday lifestyles for public benefit.","Kuwait’s Minister of Health, Dr. Ahmad Al-Awadhi, signed a ministerial decree with key rules on energy drinks.

Is SmartPocket trustworthy?





For many students in the UAE, the gap between a monthly allowance and the cost of living can feel like a mountain to climb. Recognizing this, two young visionaries, Najib Mikati, a senior at the American School of Dubai, and Naji Faqihinejad, a freshman at George Washington University, spent 18 months developing SmartPocket.This mobile platform is more than just a discount tool; it is a financial companion designed specifically for the 12-to-25 demographic, helping them stretch their dirhams while learning the ""why"" behind their spending.Nineteen-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi came up with the idea for SmartPocket while he was in his final year at the American School of Dubai. Like many students, his monthly allowance stayed the same, but costs for essentials such as food, fashion and fitness kept climbing due to inflation.“While our monthly allowances from our parents stayed the same, our spending needs naturally evolved,” Al Awadhi told Khaleej Times, explaining the spark behind the idea. What began as a personal challenge became the seed of a platform designed to make student life more affordable.Two years later, SmartPocket launched publicly in October 2025, giving students a dedicated place to access discounts from more than 20 brands across multiple categories.SmartPocket isn’t open to everyone, users must first verify their student status before accessing deals. Verification happens through official channels like university email addresses or documents such as Emirates IDs, ensuring that only real students can benefit from the discounts.Once verified, students can browse and redeem offers from partner brands in categories such as:Al Awadhi estimates that, on average, users end up reducing their monthly spending by around 20%, though the platform is still new and collecting data to confirm long-term saving trends.This concept is similar in spirit to global student discount networks, like UNiDAYS, which offers exclusive student deals on hundreds of brands worldwide, but SmartPocket is tailored specifically to the UAE market with its own verification and brand partnerships.At the heart of SmartPocket is 19-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, while studying at the American School of Dubai, Al Awadhi noticed a familiar problem: his monthly allowance didn’t stretch as far as he wanted, especially as prices for food, fashion and leisure kept rising. Rather than simply accept it, he began thinking about a way to help students keep more of their money without cutting out the things they enjoy.The idea for SmartPocket grew from that simple challenge. After two years of refining the concept and building the platform, SmartPocket officially launched in October 2025, offering students a verified way to access deals and discounts from a growing list of local brands.Al Awadhi’s entrepreneurial journey began even earlier. At just 15 years old, he started helping his brother resell sneakers and streetwear, an early lesson in understanding markets and customer demand. That experience gave him a foundation in business that he applied to SmartPocket’s developmentOne common question about new discount platforms is whether they are legitimate and safe to use. With SmartPocket, there are a few signs that help answer this clearly.First, SmartPocket requires real student verification before anyone can access discounts. Students must verify their status using university email addresses or official documents like Emirates ID, which helps ensure the platform isn’t being misused by non-students. This verification step is a basic trust and security measure, similar to how other student discount services operate globally.Second, the app is listed on major app distribution sites like the Apple App Store, where it is presented as a genuine UAE-focused student discount app with clear offer details and secure sign-in features. This listing shows that the platform is intended for legitimate use and meets basic app store standards for security and functionality.","Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, 19, came up with the idea for SmartPocket in his final year at the American School of Dubai. After two years of refining the concept and building the platform, SmartPocket officially launched in October 2025. Users must first verify their student status before accessing deals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126115849,imgsize-48670,width-400,resizemode-4/smartpocket.jpg"

The desert heat has officially taken a backseat to the twinkling lights and ""snowy"" lanes of the UAE’s festive season. If you are looking to soak up the holiday spirit, 2025 has brought some of the most elaborate Christmas markets the region has ever seen. From giant trees to AI-powered elves, the magic is spread across Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Whether you are a resident or just visiting for the holidays, these five spots are the absolute ""must-sees"" for a cup of mulled grape and a photo with the big man in red.If you only visit one market this year, let it be this one. Nestled among the waterways of Souk Madinat Jumeirah, this 1,750-square-meter wonderland is the gold standard for festive vibes. The centerpiece is a massive 36-foot Christmas tree, and the view of the Burj Al Arab behind it is simply unbeatable.Expo City has transformed Al Wasl Plaza into a futuristic North Pole toy factory. This year’s theme, ""The Candy Cane Comet,"" features a guiding light that only shines with the help of visiting children. It is immersive, grand, and arguably the most high-tech Christmas experience in the country.Located on Sheikh Zayed Road, the Winter Garden at Habtoor Palace is where the ""cool"" crowd gathers. It’s less about the rides and more about the atmosphere, think cozy food trucks, live musicians, and a pet-friendly policy that means your furry friends don't have to miss out on the fun.For those who want their Christmas with a side of international culture, Global Village is celebrating its landmark 30th season in style. Their festive village is packed with 3,500 shopping outlets across 30 pavilions, making it the ultimate destination for unique holiday gifts.Abu Dhabi’s capital isn't trailing behind.

Many venues also offer family-friendly activities, making them ideal for visitors of all ages.Top Tip for 2025: Most of these venues get extremely busy on weekend evenings. If you can, try visiting on a weekday right when they open (around 4:00 PM) to catch the sunset views and beat the largest crowds.

"Despite crackdown on activism, US techies go on picking fights",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/despite-crackdown-on-activism-us-techies-go-on-picking-fights/articleshow/126211254.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: NYT)





Five weeks into a strike at the crowdfunding site Kickstarter this fall, employees were getting anxious. Their union's strike fund was dwindling, making it harder for some to cover living expenses, and they were unsure if the firm would make more concessions. But the next week, Kickstarter made offers the union would accept, creating a new minimum-salary formula and helping to preserve a four-day workweek.Over the past few years, US tech firms have laid off thousands of employees in a retreat from a pandemic-era hiring spree and an effort to free up cash to invest in artificial intelligence. Even tech companies once thought of as relatively progressive, like Google and Microsoft, have fired employees who have protested over political causes. The firms said the protests were disruptive and potentially unsafe.But tech worker activism has continued amid the crackdown, albeit cautiously. ""It's driving the organising underground, but people are organising,"" said Emily Mazo, a doctoral student at Columbia University who studies tech work and worker activism.Google offered thousands of voluntary exit packages this year after the Alphabet Workers Union, named for Google's parent company, launched a campaign calling for improvements in job security, like a shift away from involuntary layoffs.A Google spokesperson said that the campaign had not influenced the company. After Amazon laid off 14,000 workers this fall, hundreds of employees signed an open letter to management seeking a bigger say in how to carry out layoffs that may result from AI.Over the past two years, a wave of unionising in the video game industry that began with low-paid testers spread to designers and engineers, who joined unions at the Microsoft-owned studios that make games such as Fallout, Doom and World of Warcraft.This persistent activism has to do with a longer-term shift in how engineers and other tech workers see themselves. For decades, they identified as high-skilled professionals who stood apart from the usual management-labour divide. They were well compensated, could change jobs easily and had the freedom to allocate their time as they saw fit. Because of generous stock grants, many thought of themselves as co-owners.The Kickstarter employees didn't start off wanting a union, but ended up there when the management tried to pull a satirical comic book called ""Always Punch Nazis,"" which the rightwing wanted to be taken down. Kickstarter always attracted idealistic workers who liked its mission of helping creative people get projects off the ground. The employees got their way, but it was one of a handful of incidents that prompted them to organise a union.Prominent tech executives and investors reacted differently to instances of activism. A few, including Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, decided their companies had more to gain than to lose by staying neutral when employees tried to unionise. Others regarded it as evidence of left-wing radicalism. ""The kids turned on capitalism in a very fundamental way,"" tech investor Marc Andreessen had told NYT.Beginning in late 2022, tech and video game companies reinforced a 'worker identity' as they began to lay off thousands of employees. Among the exceptions are artificial intelligence researchers, who have been the beneficiaries of billions of dollars of investment and spending by tech companies. JS Tan, a former Microsoft engineer who is now a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and wrote the paper with Mazo, said that those researchers had effectively displaced app and web developers as some of the most sought-after tech workers, and that many software developers increasingly feared downward mobility.Meghan Day, a Google engineer who was recently elected treasurer of the Alphabet Workers Union, said workers were demoralised by layoffs at the company in 2023 and 2024. Google declined to comment.Two Amazon engineers who requested anonymity said they felt Amazon was laying off workers so it could free up money for AI infrastructure, the value of which they questioned. They also said Amazon pushed the remaining employees to pick up the tasks of ousted co-workers.","US tech firms have laid off thousands of employees in a retreat from a pandemic- era hiring spree.

"In San Francisco, a class where 'screenagers' train to navigate social media, AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-san-francisco-a-class-where-screenagers-train-to-navigate-social-media-ai/articleshow/126198653.cms,"Valerie Ziegler takes digital literacy lesson at a school in San Francisco





Most teenagers know that baseless conspiracy theories, partisan propaganda and artificially generated deepfakes lurk on social media. Valerie Ziegler's students know how to spot them.At Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, she trains her govt, economy and history students to consult a variety of sources, recognise rage-baiting content and consider influencers' motivations. They brainstorm ways to distinguish deepfakes from real footage.Ziegler, 50, is part of a vanguard of California educators racing to prepare students in a rapidly changing online world.Content moderation policies have withered at many social media platforms, making it easier to lie and harder to trust. AI is evolving so quickly, and generating such persuasive content, that even professionals are being stumped.California is ahead of many other states in pushing schools to teach digital literacy, but even there, education officials are not expected to set specific standards until later in 2026. So Ziegler and a growing group of her peers are forging ahead, cobbling together lesson plans from nonprofit groups and updating older coursework to address new technologies, such as AI that powers video apps like Sora.Their methods are hands-on, including classroom exercises that fact-check posts about history on TikTok and explore how badges that appear to signal verification on social media can often be bought rather than earned.Ziegler's efforts showcase the difficulties of keeping pace with new platforms, apps and advances in AI. ""We're sending these kids out into the world, and we're supposed to have provided them skills,"" said the former California teacher of the year. ""The tricky part is that we adults are learning this skill at the same time the kids are.""Social media literacy is a tough subject for schools to try to teach, especially now. Federal funding for education is precarious, and the Trump administration has politicised and penalised the study of disinformation and misinformation.The News Literacy Project, a media education nonprofit, surveyed 1,110 teenagers in May last year and found that 4 in 10 said they had any media literacy instruction in class that year. Eight in 10 said they had come across a conspiracy theory on social media, and many said they were inclined to believe at least one of the narratives.Ziegler teaches the self-described ""screenagers"" that their social media feeds are populated using highly responsive algorithms, and that large followings do not make accounts trustworthy. In one case, students learned to distinguish between a reputable historians group on Instagram and a historical satire account with a similar name. Now, they default to double-checking information that interests them online. ""That's the starting point,"" said Xavier Malizia, 17. Elisha Tuerk-Levy, 18, said it was ""jarring"" to watch a realistic AI video of someone falling off Mt Everest, but added that the visuals in such videos were often too smooth - a useful ""tell"" that helps identify them as fake.Policymakers are paying more attention to the issue. Dr Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general under former President Joe Biden, urged schools in 2023 to set up digital literacy instruction. At least 25 states have approved related legislation, according to an upcoming report from Media Literacy Now, a nonprofit group. Many of the new rules, however, are voluntary, toothless or slow to take effect or do not acknowledge the growing presence of AI.""I absolutely wish we could make things happen faster,"" said California Assembly member Marc Berman, a Democrat who wrote two media literacy bills passed in 2023 and 2024.""It's about really strengthening those foundational skills so that no matter what tech pops up between now and then, young people have the ability to handle it,"" Berman said.","Valerie Ziegler is part of a vanguard of California educators racing to prepare students in a rapidly changing online world.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries. The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric- enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125101750,imgsize-47068,width-400,resizemode-4/life-certificate-2025-step-by-step-guide-to-generate-and-submit-jeevan-pramaan-online-and-offline.jpg"

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The UAE is home to one of the most diverse populations in the world, with expatriates making up about 88% of the population. Every year, the country sees a steady influx of visitors, workers, and families from all corners of the globe, drawn by its thriving business environment and lifestyle appeal. In the first eight months of 2025 alone, UAE airports processed over 102.9 million passengers—a clear indication of the country’s ongoing magnetism for both short-term visitors and long-term residents.For both tourists and residents, getting around easily is what truly makes the UAE feel like home. Whether it’s navigating the lively streets of Dubai, commuting to work in minutes, or simply enjoying the country’s wide-open landscapes, having a car can make all the difference. For those who don’t have the time or inclination to learn the public transport system, renting a car is often the quickest and most convenient way to explore. The recent update to the UAE’s driving license system, introduced under the “Markhoos” initiative, makes a significant difference. Visitors from 52 countries can now drive with their home country’s license, skipping the usual hassle of temporary permits or local driving tests, removing a key barrier and making life here even more convenient.And for those who plan to make the UAE their permanent home, it’s just as seamless. Foreign nationals can now exchange their existing driving licenses for a UAE one, without the need for theory or practical tests. It’s a small but meaningful shift that speaks volumes about the country’s approach to making life simpler for those who choose to settle here.The Ministry’s new framework transparently breaks things down into two main processes: recognition and exchange. Each one has its own set of conditions, depending on whether you're a visitor or a resident, making it easier to understand who comprehensively qualifies for what and how the system practically functions.This specifically applies to non-residents or temporary visitors in the UAE. Under the official recognition policy, visitors can legally drive using their valid national driving licenses during their short-term stay, provided they are not in the country for permanent residency purposes, and no additional tests or local license are required.This specifically applies to residents of the UAE who currently and simply hold a valid foreign driving license. They are allowed to easily and naturally exchange their national licenses for a UAE driving license upon meeting specific requirements, with no need for officially required theory or road tests. This exchange is valid only after conveniently and directly obtaining a UAE residence permit.Both recognition and exchange options apply to vehicle categories, typically motorcycles and light vehicles, which vary by nationality and are enabled through mutual agreements or memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between the UAE and the respective countries.Depending on whether an individual is visiting or residing in the UAE, different requirements apply:To drive in the UAE using a national license:The license must cover the vehicle type, typically motorcycles and light vehicles, which vary by nationalityTo exchange a foreign license for a UAE license:The updated list includes 52 countries whose citizens are now permitted to either use their national licenses in the UAE during visits or exchange them for a UAE license upon acquiring residency. These include:It’s important to note that South Korean citizens can only exchange their driving licenses for a UAE license after becoming residents. They are not allowed to use their national license for driving in the UAE while visiting.This policy update offers significant benefits for both visitors and residents:GCC nationals can drive in the UAE using their home country's license while visiting, without the need for any additional permits or tests. However, once a GCC national becomes a UAE resident, they are required to exchange their GCC license for a UAE driving license. This exchange must be done through the official UAE system, using the MuroorKhous digital platform, at a cost of AED 600.For GCC nationals who are no longer residents of a GCC country, the situation changes. If they are from a country that is not approved for direct license exchange (i.e., not one of the 52 eligible nations), they must pass both the theory and road tests to obtain a UAE license. These tests do not require driving classes, but applicants will need to open a traffic file and pay a fee that typically ranges from AED 2,000 to AED 2,500, depending on the emirate.Once all requirements are met, the new UAE license is issued without additional testing. This process ensures that all residents, regardless of nationality, meet the necessary standards to drive legally and safely in the UAE.Yes, if they’re from one of 52 eligible countries and meet the required conditions for recognition.No, eligible residents can exchange their national license without taking theory or practical tests.The categories, typically motorcycles and light vehicles, vary by nationality based on bilateral agreements.The service costs AED 600 and is processed through the digital MuroorKhous platform.You’ll need a valid residence permit, original national license, a legal translation, and to pass a vision test.

Tesla may soon allow vehicle owners to use Apple Car Keys to unlock and start their cars. New evidence from a recent software update indicates that the electric vehicle company led by Elon Musk is preparing to support native digital keys that live directly within a smartphone's operating system, rather than just within a specific app. According to a report by Not a Tesla App, several code references to"" have been discovered in version 4.52.0 of the Tesla mobile app. This discovery is a significant development because it shows that Tesla is changing how its vehicles connect with mobile devices, making the experience more seamless for users.At the moment, Tesla owners rely on asystem that uses a Bluetooth connection and requires the Tesla app to be running in the background. By switching to a native wallet key, the digital key is stored in the phone's secure hardware at the system level. This change makes the key much more reliable and easier to access because it no longer depends on the app staying open to function.The code found in Tesla app version 4.52.0 references Huawei's HarmonyOS system. This means the first version appears designed for Huawei Wallet on Huawei phones. HarmonyOS is very popular in China, where Huawei is a major smartphone brand.

The car keys are stored in a secure chip inside the iPhone and Apple Watch.This will enable special features like Express Mode, which lets users unlock a car without needing Face ID, Touch ID, or a password. The system can even work when the phone battery is nearly dead.Earlier this month, Rivian added native support for both Apple Wallet and Google Wallet digital car keys in its 2025.46 software update.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"
