How US schools are using AI to detect guns on campus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-schools-are-using-ai-to-detect-guns-on-campus/articleshow/110154424.cms,"NEW DEHI: The United States is witnessing a significant shift in school safety measures as educational institutions across the country are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence ( AI ) solutions to detect firearms on their premises. This move is largely driven by the rising concerns over school shootings and the need for more proactive safety solutions.Kansas and Missouri have taken the lead in implementing AI gun detection systems in schools.Kansas is planning to offer grants of up to $5 million to schools for installing surveillance cameras equipped with AI systems capable of detecting individuals carrying firearms. Missouri has already passed a budget bill that includes funding for AI weapon detection systems in schools, allocating $2.5 million for the purpose.The AI technology being employed in these schools is designed to detect visible firearms in real-time. When a potential threat is identified, images are sent to a continuously staffed operations center where trained professionals verify the threat before notifying local authorities and school officials.This technology is particularly effective in detecting brandished weapons and can provide instant alerts to school administrators and law enforcement. One of the most prominent AI gun detection systems being used in schools is ZeroEyes, founded by military veterans after the fatal shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. ZeroEyes employs AI in conjunction with surveillance cameras to detect visible firearms and sends an alert to the operations center, where a specialist will confirm if it is a gun or not. The AI software is only able to detect guns and does not have facial recognition or voice recordings.The effectiveness of these AI systems is evident in the numerous success stories. For instance, the Mount Pulaski Community Unit School District 23 in Illinois uses the ZeroEyes system and has reported several instances where the technology detected guns and led to arrests. The system's ability to analyze more than 36,000 pictures per second from its clients' surveillance feeds makes it an invaluable tool in enhancing school safety.The integration of AI technology in schools is not limited to ZeroEyes. Other companies like Iterate.ai and Omnilert are also offering AI gun detection solutions. Iterate.ai's free AI system can detect various weapons and sends automatic alerts to school administrators and local law enforcement.Omnilert Gun Detect is an AI visual system that integrates with existing camera systems to provide near-instant response at the sight of a gun. While the adoption of AI gun detection systems in schools is a significant step towards enhancing safety, there are concerns about the technology's effectiveness and potential challenges. Issues such as false alarms, missed detections, and the adaptation to the quirks of the technology have been reported.Additionally, there are privacy concerns, particularly relevant in educational settings filled with minors. Despite these challenges, the integration of AI technology in schools is expected to play an increasingly vital role in preventing potential incidents and enhancing the overall safety of students and staff. As the technology continues to evolve, it is crucial that schools and authorities work together to address the challenges and ensure the effective implementation of these systems.","Kansas and Missouri have taken the lead in implementing AI gun detection systems in schools.

Red flags: Be cautious of these warning signs

WhatsApp investment scams : Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money. They're creating fake investment groups , pretending to be famous brands and professionals, and offering phony stock tips and trading courses .According to ET, scamsters send group invitations to WhatsApp users, claiming to be from a well-known fund house.The messages promise free access to high-quality investment portfolios and daily stock recommendations as part of an online event celebrating the fund's anniversary in India.1. Victims are added to random WhatsApp investing groups.2. Multiple groups are created simultaneously.3. The profile of a famous investor and their credentials are shared with group members.4. Discussions begin in the group, with some members hyping up upcoming 'lessons' or 'opportunities'.5. Initial stock tips are shared for free, with conflicting tips shared in other groups.6. Some tips work in favor of certain groups, encouraging members to invest more.7. Less successful groups are abandoned.8. Active members are pushed to invest in special programs with promises of bigger rewards.9. If a victim refuses to invest more or tries to withdraw funds, their account is disabled, and the WhatsApp group is deactivated. Scammers vanish with the victims' funds.These scamsters employ a very common tactic to impersonate renowned fund managers, financial advisors , and influential figures within the finance community. By leveraging the identities of individuals like Porinju Veliyath and Ajay Kacholia, these fraudsters aim to lend an air of credibility to their operations, preying on investors' desire for lucrative stock tips, the financial daily’s report said.Santosh Joseph, Founder of Germinate Investor Services, was quoted as saying, “These scamsters prey on investors’ appetite for stock tips, particularly coming from star names.”They might pose as an investment academy or class, with a 'professor' or 'teacher' (often the impersonated individual). Discussions in group chats are often scripted, with members expressing excitement about upcoming opportunities or asking about the trading program. Usually, these active participants are affiliates who pretend to be genuine members, adding a false sense of legitimacy to the operation.Rahul Ghose, CEO of Hedged.in, says, “Messages planted by their own affiliates gives the entire set-up a feel of legitimacy.”Some scamsters even mention past trading successes under the 'teacher's' guidance, providing screenshots as evidence. This is to create a fear of missing out (FOMO) among unsuspecting members. They also create a sense of urgency by pushing a 'limited time opportunity' or warning of missing out on profitable trades. Another tactic is to offer investors a free 'trial' period to test the waters. Initial stock tips may be given for free to build confidence.Many of these scams operate as 'pump and dump' schemes. The scamsters or their associates convince people to buy stocks they already hold. They artificially inflate the stock price through circular trading. Once enough people buy, they sell their shares at a significant profit, causing the stock price to drop sharply. Other scams involve enticing people to transfer money in exchange for supposedly lucrative tips or recommendations. These tips are fake, so scammers create multiple investor groups, suggesting different ideas to each group.Ghose points out that different groups receive conflicting 'buy-sell' calls. Because some of these 'ideas' will succeed, members of those groups are pushed to invest more. Meanwhile, other groups are abandoned, and the cycle repeats.Investors should be cautious and watch for signs of fraud. If you receive a random invitation to join a trading community from unknown contacts, proceed with caution. Avoid falling for promises of quick wealth or guaranteed returns. As Santosh Joseph advises, ""Stay away from stock tips, no matter who shares them.""If an investing group claims affiliation with a trusted name or brand, verify its authenticity by reaching out to the person or company through social media or email, as recommended by Rahul Ghose. They're likely to identify any scam. Lastly, be wary of requests to send money through unverified links or download third-party apps, as these could be suspicious.","Scamsters are using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to trick investors with the promise of fast money.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Scenario 1 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle Purchase transaction date – October 15, 2023 As bill is yet to be generated in the given case, the refund amount received on October 19, 2023, shall be adjusted with other debits, prior to calculation of the Total Amount Due. Refund on October 19, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 15, 2023 Scenario 2 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post generation of bill but before making payment of the dues Purchase transaction date - October 29, 2023 The bill is generated on October 30, 2023, however, the payment towards the dues has not been made till the date of refund. Therefore, the refund amount received on November 04, 2023, shall be adjusted towards the Total Amount Due (TAD) and accordingly the cardholder will be required to pay only the remaining outstanding (Remaining outstanding = TAD – Refund amount). Scenario 3 – Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction for which payment has already been made Purchase transaction date - October 30, 2023 As the cardholder has already cleared the dues, card-issuers shall seek explicit consent of the cardholder to adjust the refund amount in line with the provision stipulated at Para 10(h) of the MD. Payment towards dues – November 06, 2023 Case I - If the cardholder gives explicit consent, then refund amount shall be adjusted. Refund on November 07, 2023 - For cancellation of purchase dated October 30, 2023 Case II - If the cardholder does not provide the consent or no response is received for adjustment of the refund, then the refund amount will be credited to the bank account of the cardholder in line with para 10(h). Further, if the cardholder makes a request for crediting the refund (transaction for which payment has already been made), the same shall be credited back to the bank account of the cardholder irrespective of the cut off defined under Para10(h).

Scenario 2

Purchase transaction date: October 29, 2023

Refund or reversal occurs after the bill is generated but before the payment due date (November 19, 2023).

The refund amount will be credited to the cardholder's account and will reduce the outstanding dues to be paid before the due date.

Credit cards offer a convenient means to manage finances and enhance financial well-being. By using credit cards responsibly, individuals can build a positive credit history and improve their financial habits. It's important to use credit cards for expenses while ensuring timely repayment of debts to boost credit scores.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.One important question addressed in the FAQs is whether a credit card can be used beyond its sanctioned limit, with over-limit charges imposed, states an ET report. According to RBI guidelines, using a credit card beyond the approved limit (overlimit) necessitates explicit consent from the cardholder. Furthermore, cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit feature through various platforms provided by the card issuer. Without explicit consent, neither overlimit facilities can be extended nor overlimit charges levied.Here are some key FAQs derived from the Master Direction (MD) - Credit Card and Debit Card – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022:Card issuers cannot send credit cards without the customer's permission. If a customer gets an unsolicited card, they should not activate it or agree to its activation. If they don't consent, the issuer must close the credit card account within seven working days at no cost to the customer. The issuer will inform the customer about the closure. After that, the customer should destroy the card. If needed, the customer can complain to the issuer and escalate the issue to the RBI Ombudsman.If a cardholder fails to pay the total amount due by the payment due date, they will lose the interest-free credit period. Interest may be charged from the transaction date on the outstanding amount (adjusted for payments, refunds, or reversed transactions) and not the total due amount. Late payment fees and other charges will only apply to the outstanding amount after the payment due date, not the total amount due.Paragraphs 7(b) and 7(c) of the MD allow the issuance of different types of credit cards that can tap into the limits of various loan accounts. These cards are tailored to match the terms and conditions of the specific loan account. For instance, if a customer has an overdraft facility, they can receive a credit card to access the funds from that facility. The terms of use for this credit card, including interest rates, repayment schedules, penalties, and cash withdrawal limits, will mirror those of the overdraft facility.Additionally, paragraph 7(c) gives card issuers the flexibility to design Business Credit Cards according to their credit card policies. However, it's important to note that banks are not allowed to issue debit cards for cash credit or loan accounts.Which transactions can be used to reduce the amount owed and credited to the cardholder's bank account?In a standard credit card cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023, assuming the bill is issued on October 30, 2023, and payment is due by November 19, 2023, here are the possible scenarios for adjusting credit:Activation of a credit card is confirmed through customer-initiated actions such as PIN generation, adjusting transaction controls, Interactive Voice Response, contacting customer care through recorded calls, or SMS communication. If the card remains inactive for more than 30 days from the date of issue, the card issuer must request One Time Password (OTP) based consent, as outlined in paragraph 6(a)(vi) of the MD.For business credit cards applied for by a corporate or business entity, card issuers must obtain explicit consent from the principal account holder, as specified in paragraph 6(a)(vi). Similarly, they must send notifications as per paragraph 8(b). This consent should come from the principal cardholder, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. Likewise, for retail credit cards, consent must be obtained from the principal cardholder, not from any add-on cardholders.Card issuers are not permitted to apply interest or other charges to unpaid taxes, levies, or charges. This provision, outlined in paragraph 9(b)(ii) of the MD, took effect from October 1, 2022. Therefore, card issuers cannot apply such charges to any unpaid taxes, levies, or charges billed from that date onwards.Regarding transactions eligible for adjustment towards outstanding dues and credited to the cardholder's bank account, let's consider a typical credit card billing cycle from October 1, 2023, to October 30, 2023. Assume the bill is generated on October 30, 2023, with a payment due date of November 19, 2023. Here are the different scenarios:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction within the same billing cycle:- Credit of refund/failed/reversed transaction post-generation of bill but before making payment of the dues:","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently introduced amendments effective from March 7, 2024, alongside releasing updated FAQs regarding credit and debit card issuance.

EPF members can stop automatic EPF account transfers



EPF automatic account transfer : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts . Despite its usefulness, this facility remains relatively unknown.As per an ET report, the automatic transfer simplifies the process for EPF members switching jobs , enabling them to seamlessly move their PF balances without the need for online or offline transfer requests.The transfer occurs automatically from the old employer to the new one, sparing members the hassle of managing the transfer themselves.Vaibhav Bhardwaj, a Partner at INDUSLAW, said that EPFO's automatic EPF account transfer has been operational since 2017.However, it's important to note that not all EPF members have access to the automatic transfer facility from old to new employers. It's only available for those whose EPF accounts are managed by EPFO. Exempted PF trusts are not included in this automatic transfer option.Gupta explains that if either the previous or current company operates a private provident fund trust, the auto-transfer feature will not function. A private PF trust oversees the provident fund contributions of employees within the respective company, rather than through the EPFO. However, it must still comply with EPFO regulations.Bhardwaj adds that EPF members transferring their old EPF account to a new EPF account, whether from EPF to an exempted trust or vice versa, or between exempted trusts, will need to apply for transfer using Form 13, either online or offline.The EPFO has set specific requirements for automatic EPF account transfers from old to new employers. These conditions, outlined in a November 2017 circular, include:(i) Matching UAN and Aadhaar numbers provided by the new employer with existing details in the UAN.(ii) Aadhaar number of the EPF member must be linked and verified with the UAN at their previous workplace.(iii) Availability of EPF member's details such as date of joining, date of exit, and reason for exit from the old employer.(iv) Activation of EPF member's UAN, with a registered mobile number.Bhardwaj further explains that when an employee starts a new job and receives their first month's provident fund contribution from the new employer, an automatic transfer is activated. This triggers the transfer of the EPF member's previous provident fund dues to their new account.Once the process is triggered, an SMS and email notification inform the member about the initiation of the auto transfer.Sandeep Agrawal, Director and Co-Founder of Teamlease Regtech, said that for automatic transfer claims, there's no requirement to submit Form 13. However, if the automatic transfer doesn't occur within the specified time due to issues like mismatched dates of exit, not updated exit dates by a previous employer, member details mismatch, or pending UAN Aadhaar seeding, members can opt for online Form 13 to transfer EPF and EPS accumulation from the previous employer to the present one.Once an EPF member receives SMS and email notifications regarding the auto transfer of their EPF account, they should verify if the transfer has been successful.Puneet Gupta, Partner at People Advisory Services EY India, mentions that the auto transfer process will only be finalized if the member doesn't request to stop it within 10 days of receiving the notification, either online, through the employer, or at the nearest EPFO office. Additionally, the transfer will be completed after the first contribution from the new employer is deposited and reconciled.The automatic EPF transfer follows a similar process to manual requests. Experts suggest that it may take 2-3 weeks for the automatic transfer to complete.Sandeep Agrawal adds that members can confirm the transfer by checking their passbooks. By logging into the unified portal and navigating to 'View Passbook,' members can see a credit entry if their PF has been successfully transferred.EPF members have the option to halt automatic transfers if they prefer. They can do so within 10 days of receiving the SMS notification about the auto transfer initiation. This can be done online via the Member e-Sewa portal or offline through their current employer or by visiting the nearest EPFO office.Gupta has mentioned the steps for stopping the automatic transfer online:1. Log in to the EPFO Member portal.2. Navigate to the ""Online services"" tab and select ""Track claim status.""3. Choose the option ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases.""If the auto transfer request has been triggered, it will appear under ""Stop auto-initiated claim cases,"" providing the option to halt the transfer. After stopping the EPF transfer, the member will receive communication via SMS to the mobile number linked to the UAN and the registered email address.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) offers a convenient solution for its members when changing jobs: automatic transfer of EPF accounts.

Additional security measures



Aadhaar Mapping for nodal offices



New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Google I/O 2024: Android is getting features to protect phones when they are stolen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-i/o-2024-android-is-getting-features-to-protect-phones-when-they-are-stolen/articleshow/110157237.cms,"Improved device and data protection to deter theft before it happens

Security features to strengthen Android device's security against theft:

Factory reset upgrade prevents a reset by a thief:

Private space to hide sensitive apps:

More steps for changing sensitive device settings:

Enhanced authentication in case the PIN is known by a thief:

Automatic protection when the phone is stolen

Automatic AI-powered screen lock:

Offline Device Lock for added protection:

Automatic locking of Android device after they are stolen

With Remote Lock feature

Google I/O 2024 , the company’s annual developers conference, is underway. On the second day of the event, Google announced several features for Android smartphones, including a new suite of advanced theft protection features that it claims will protect users’ data before, during and after their phone is stolen.Google is bringing a bunch of new features and enhancing some older ones to strengthen an Android device's security against theft.It says that the new and improved protection features “will make thieves think twice about trying.”Usually, when a phone is stolen, thieves quickly reset the device and resell it. Android phones will now be difficult to factory reset with an upgrade to Android’s factory reset protection. If your phone is stolen, thieves won’t be able to factory reset it as it will require device or Google account credentials – rendering the stolen device unsellable.In case a thief gets access to your phone, they may want to extract valuable data and transfer funds from your phone that can be worth much more than the phone itself. Android will now have a ‘Private’ space – a separate area in the phone that can hide and lock with a separate PIN, giving users additional security for apps that may contain sensitive data, like health or financial information.Android phones will now require PIN, password or biometric authentication to disable Find My Device or extend screen timeout, essentially adding an extra layer of security.When enabled, the new enhanced authentication will require biometrics for accessing and changing critical Google account and device settings, like changing your PIN, disabling theft protection or accessing Passkeys, from an untrusted location.Factory reset protection updates and private space will be released as part of Android 15 while enhanced authentication protections will be released to select devices later this year.In case your phone is stolen, Android will soon automatically recognise suspicious signals and proactively protect the data on the device.When your Android phone is snatched, the Theft Detection Lock feature will use Google AI to sense it by detecting common motion associated with theft and quickly locks the screen.If a thief tries to disconnect a stolen Android phone for prolonged periods of time, Offline Device Lock automatically locks the screen to help protect your data even when the device is off the grid. It will also lock the device screen when excessive failed authentication attempts are made.Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock will be available to Android 10+ devices through a Google Play services update later this year.Third is an upgrade to the Find My Device feature that allows users to remotely lock or wipe a lost or stolen phone and mark it as lost for easier tracking., users will be able to lock the screen of their phones with just their phone numbers and a quick security challenge using any device, essentially buying you the time to recover account details and perform full factory reset.","Google I/O 2024, the company’s annual developers conference, is underway.

The number of times Google said “AI” during the presentation

Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, kicked off today with a keynote address by CEO Sundar Pichai . As expected, AI was a prominent theme, with Pichai highlighting significant advancements in Google's Gemini AI models and the company's growing prowess in the field. Here's a deeper dive into some of the key numbers Pichai shared:Google introduced Gemini 1.5 Pro earlier this year allowing AI models to handle long context.It can run 1 million tokens in production, which it claims is more than any other large-scale foundation model yet.Pichai said that more than 1.5 million developers use Gemini models across the company's tools. He said that Gemini 1.5 Pro is available to all developers globally across 35 languages.“All of our 2-billion user products use Gemini,” Pichai said, adding that over 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini AI in just three months.While talking about Google Photos, Pichai said that the app – which was launched almost nine years ago – sees more than 6 billion photos and videos being uploaded every single day.While discussing multimodality in AI models, Pichai said that Gemini AI models have taken a step further in terms long context, enabling us to bring in even more information: hundreds of pages of text, hours of audio or an hour of video, entire code repos…or, if you want, roughly 96 Cheesecake Factory menus.The top executive announced the company’s 6th generation of TPUs, called Trillium. Trillium is said to be Google’s most performant and most efficient TPU to date, delivering a 4.7x improvement in compute performance per chip over the previous generation, TPU v5e.Pichai said that Google’s total deployed fleet capacity for liquid cooling systems is nearly 1 gigawatt and growing — that’s close to 70 times the capacity of any other fleet.“Underlying this is the sheer scale of our network, which connects our infrastructure globally. Our network spans more than 2 million miles of terrestrial and subsea fiber: over 10 times (!) the reach of the next leading cloud provider,” he added.Among various other jokes, there was a tongue in cheek moment on stage where Google seemed to take a dig at last year’s reports where publications counted how many times did Google executives use the word “AI” over the course of the presentation.Pichai said that Gemini has done the heavy lifting and counted it. All Google executives used “AI” terms over 120 times during the 110-minute presentation.","Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, kicked off today.

Music Haptics and Vocal Shortcuts enhance accessibility

AI-powered features reduce motion sickness and improve Speech Recognition

visionOS and CarPlay receive accessibility upgrades

Apple has announced a bunch of new accessibility features for iPhone , iPad , and Vision Pro , which should help users with disabilities interact with their devices better. The new features, including Eye Tracking and Music Haptics , are expected to debut in iOS 18 and VisionOS later this year, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a more inclusive user experience.The standout feature is Eye Tracking, which enables users with physical disabilities to navigate their iPhone or iPad using only their eyes. By using the front-facing camera and on-device machine learning, Eye Tracking allows users to select elements on the screen by simply holding their gaze, eliminating the need for touch input. It uses AI to recognize user gestures like swiping and tapping. Apple's Dwell Control feature is already available on Macs, sensing when someone's gaze pauses on an element. The setup process is quick, and it works with third-party apps integrated into the OS, like Assistive Touch.Apple also introduced Music Haptics, a feature designed for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Using the iPhone's Taptic Engine, Music Haptics translates millions of songs on Apple Music into taps, textures, and vibrations, providing a new way to experience music. Additionally, Vocal Shortcuts allows users to assign custom phrases to launch shortcuts and perform complex tasks hands-free.Vehicle Motion Cues, another notable addition, aims to reduce motion sickness for passengers using their iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle. By displaying animated dots on the screen's edges that mimic the vehicle's motion, the feature minimises sensory conflict. Furthermore, Listen for Atypical Speech uses machine learning to recognize unique speech patterns, benefiting users with conditions like cerebral palsy, ALS, or stroke.Apple's upcoming visionOS platform will include systemwide Live Captions, aiding users who are deaf or hard of hearing in following along with spoken dialogue. CarPlay will also gain accessibility features like Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and control apps while driving.","Apple announces new accessibility features for iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro.

Google is changing internet search as we know it, infusing it with AI and serving up all the information you need on top of the page so you don't have to scroll through the whole internet. Gone are the days when you'd have to type out what you wanted to know or even put a photo. Now, you can just show AI the things you need help with, and it'll have the answer for you.But what if it's not working as it should be, meaning giving the wrong answers, so bad that even a human knows, but AI doesn't?In a video showing "" Search in the Gemini era ,"" Google showed its hot new feature, the video search. What does it do? Video search allows you to search by talking over a video clip.The example they used was a video of a film camera where the lever to advance the film was stuck. They asked Gemini: ""Why is the lever not moving all the way."" Gemini quickly listed solutions, including one that wasn’t right and would ruin the photos for sure.Google’s AI told the person to ""Open the back door and gently remove the film if the camera is jammed."" Doing that to a film camera would ruin all the photos by exposing the film to light.So far, Google has provided no comment on this matter.This isn’t the first time Google has run into issues with its AI on stage. Last year, at I/O, when it was showcasing the Bard (the former name of Gemini), the AI chatbot wrongly claimed that the James Webb Space Telescope took the first pictures of exoplanets when it was the European Very Large Telescope in 2004. This error cost Google about $100 billion, wiping out a huge chunk of its market valuation.Leave the text, but Google’s image AI isn’t that perfect, either. Earlier this year, Gemini also faced criticism for refusing to generate images of white people and producing historically inaccurate content like ""Asian Nazis."" Google apologised for this and had to pause the image-generating capabilities for a few weeks.","Video search allows you to search by talking over a video clip.

With the first Android 15 beta already in the hands of developers, Google is poised to unveil a host of new user-facing features designed to enhance productivity, privacy, and security. Android 15 promises to deliver a more polished and efficient mobile experience, from improved notification management to a more refined user interface.Although Google I/O is primarily a software-focused event, the company has been known to surprise audiences with hardware announcements in the past. This year, the Pixel 8a has already been unveiled ahead of the conference, but that doesn't mean Google is out of tricks. Whispers of a potential Pixel Fold 2 or even a teaser for the upcoming Pixel 9 series have been circulating, leaving tech enthusiasts eager to see what Google has up its sleeve.We might also see some new Nest hardware make it to the main stage. A new chromecast, possibly a ‘Pro’ one.In addition to the headline-grabbing announcements, Google I/O 2024 is expected to showcase updates and improvements across the company's vast ecosystem of products and services. From enhancements to Google Maps and Google Workspace to advancements in WearOS and smart home technology - we could hear about the new upgrades coming to them. But, at the end of the day, it’s going to be all about AI.The keynote is what most normal people focus on, but the I/O is a developer galore. Developers can look forward to a wealth of sessions, workshops, and resources designed to help them leverage the latest technologies and best practices in their projects. Whether it's harnessing the power of AI, optimising for Android 15, or integrating with Google's ever-expanding suite of tools, developers are in for new technologies to play with.With AI poised to take centre stage and Android 15 promising a new era of mobile innovation, Google seems ready to set the tone for the coming year at the I/O 2024.","Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O 2024, will kick off on May 14.

Phone condition: Assess the physical condition of the phone. Look for scratches, dents, or other signs of wear. Check the screen for cracks and ensure all buttons and ports function correctly.

Age of the phone: Determine how old the phone is and consider its release date. Older models may lack software updates and compatibility with newer apps.

Battery health: Battery life is crucial for a smooth user experience. Inquire about the battery health and ask for details on its capacity and degradation over time.

Software updates: Ensure the phone is compatible with the latest software updates from the manufacturer. Older devices may not receive updates, which can impact security and functionality.

Network compatibility: Confirm that the phone is unlocked or compatible with your network carrier. Some phones are locked to specific carriers, limiting your options.

IMEI check: Verify the phone's IMEI number to ensure it's not stolen or blacklisted. This step helps prevent buying a phone with legal issues or unpaid bills.

Performance testing: Test the phone's performance by running apps, browsing the internet, and checking the camera quality. Look for lagging or freezing issues.

Storage capacity: Determine the phone's storage capacity and assess whether it meets your needs for storing photos, videos, and apps.

Price comparison: Research the market value of the phone model you're interested in. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting a fair deal.

Seller reputation: Buy from reputable sellers with positive reviews or ratings. Avoid transactions with unknown individuals or suspicious online platforms.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4 new camera features Apple may add to iPhone 16 Pro models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/4-new-camera-features-apple-may-add-to-iphone-16-pro-models/articleshow/110057298.cms,"Upgraded ultra-wide cameras



Tetra-prism lens for iPhone 16 Pro



Improved lens flare control



New Sony primary sensor for improved low-light photography



Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September. The upcoming lineup may include four smartphone models -- the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Pro variants in the upcoming iPhone lineup are rumoured to bring new features like larger displays, a dedicated Capture button and more.According to a recent report by 9to5Mac, the Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to add multiple noticeable improvements to the camera hardware of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models. Here are four new camera upgrades that may arrive with iPhone 16 Pro smartphones:Rumours suggest the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may get an upgraded 48MP Ultra Wide camera this year. This is expected to be a major improvement from the current 12 MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 15 Pro models.This upgrade is expected to offer improved performance in various shooting scenarios, particularly in low-light conditions. Images captured with the new Ultra-Wide camera are likely to show greater details and enhanced colour accuracy. The higher resolution will also provide increased flexibility during editing and post-processing.Furthermore, the 48MP Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 16 Pro may also lead to significant advancements in spatial video recording. This feature, which utilises both the Main and Ultra Wide lenses, may enable the iPhone 16 Pro to record spatial video in 4K resolution. To compare, the iPhone 15 Pro is limited to recording spatial video at 1080p resolution.The current iPhone 15 Pro Max features a new tetra-prism camera design which offers 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom capabilities. With the upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, Apple is reportedly planning to extend this upgraded tetra-prism camera to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro model as well. This means both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will offer at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.Rumours also suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro Max might feature a “periscope ultra-long telephoto combination.” This technology could potentially enable optical zoom greater than 5x.A common issue faced by most iPhone users is capturing lens flare while shooting in bright lighting conditions. This results in unexpected artefacts and internal reflections showing on images. While this problem is prevalent across most cameras on the market, Apple is reportedly working on a solution for the iPhone 16 Pro.According to rumours, Apple is testing a new ""atomic layer deposition"" (ALD) lens coating technology for the iPhone 16 Pro models. This anti-reflective coating could be applied to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera lenses to reduce the impact of internal reflections.If this rumour is true, users can expect fewer unexpected artefacts in images captured with the iPhone 16 Pro, particularly in bright lighting scenarios.The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a new main camera sensor from Sony, which is designed to improve low-light performance.As per the report, Sony's latest stacked sensor technology separates the photodiodes and pixel transistors (which are usually combined into a single layer). This separation will allow the photodiodes responsible for capturing light to be significantly larger within the same overall pixel size.Sony claims that this new sensor will capture twice as much light as existing camera sensors. The increased light capture and reduced noise are expected to offer improved photos for iPhone users in all conditions.However, it remains uncertain whether this next-generation Sony sensor will be utilised in both iPhone 16 Pro models. A tipster on the Chinese social media platform Weibo suggested that only the iPhone 16 Pro Max may feature this upgraded stacked camera sensor hardware.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series later this year in September.

The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs.

Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs.

Premier League clubs will have the opportunity to vote on the continuation of VAR next season during their annual general meeting in June.Wolves have taken the lead by submitting a resolution to abolish VAR, citing concerns that the system is undermining the value of the Premier League brand due to a series of contentious decisions this season.The vote, scheduled for June 6, will require at least 14 out of the 20 clubs to vote in favor of scrapping VAR for it to be removed from the Premier League.Wolves are expected to engage with other clubs to garner support for their proposal ahead of the meeting.VAR was introduced to the Premier League in 2019 with the intention of aiding referees in avoiding clear and obvious errors. However, its implementation has been surrounded by controversy, with numerous contentious decisions sparking criticism from managers and fans alike.""The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart,"" a Wolves statement said.""However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.""The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League,PGMOL and our fellow competitors.""Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards.""Wolves manager Gary O'Neil disclosed that he has been receiving apologetic phone calls from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief Howard Webb following VAR decisions that went against his team.The impact of VAR on goal celebrations, prolonged check durations, and a lack of communication in stadiums have all been cited as issues that have frustrated supporters and contributed to Wolves' call for scrapping the system.However, the Premier League maintains that VAR remains a valuable tool.

Surrounded by a mix of young, athletic prospects from South America, Messi finds himself in a more open, end-to-end style of play than he has experienced in his club career.This has led to a shift in his role, as he now drops deeper to help build play from the back and weaves through lines with quick one-twos, showcasing his unrivalled vision and passing ability.Messi's impact on the league is undeniable, as he leads MLS in assists and is among the top scorers, averaging an impressive 1.18 goals per 90 minutes played. His ability to break into the penalty area and create chances for himself and his teammates is a testament to his enduring brilliance.While Inter Miami may not go down as the greatest team in MLS history due to their defensive frailties, they are currently top of the league and must-see TV whenever Messi takes the field. It is clear that Messi is not letting the league retire him; instead, he is retiring the league on his own terms, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest players to ever grace the game.",Lionel Messi scored a stunning goal in his first game of the MLS season. The Barcelona star is currently leading the league in assists and goals. Messi is expected to play for Argentina in the Copa América this summer.
