Tyreek Hill trade rumors: Is he secretly plotting an escape from Miami?

Could Tyreek Hill be the game-changing weapon Atlanta needs to dominate the NFC South?

Atlanta Falcons eye a potential offensive revolution





Tyreek Hill, one of the NFL’s most explosive playmakers, is once again making headlines — not just for his speed, but for what that speed could mean for a team in desperate need of offensive firepower. The Miami Dolphins wide receiver, already known as a human highlight reel, is at the center of swirling speculation linking him to the Atlanta Falcons amid cap space challenges in Miami. And now, with reports of a dramatic offseason body transformation aimed at increasing his top-end speed, the buzz is reaching new heights.Despite the rumors of a potential trade, Tyreek Hill hasn’t let the noise distract him. His mindset remains laser-focused on delivering elite performances. “Every day I’m trying to prove myself as one of those guys this team can depend on in crucial moments… At the end of the day, I’m just looking to move forward from that. Hoping that I can prove myself and prove to my teammates that I’m still one of those ones,” Hill said. That mentality — combined with his work ethic — signals that wherever he ends up, he’ll bring more than just raw speed.If Hill does land in Atlanta, he could instantly elevate a developing offense into a top-tier unit.With rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. projected to lead the huddle and young stars like Kyle Pitts and Drake London already in place, Hill could open up the field in ways the Falcons haven’t seen in years. His ability to stretch defenses would not only create big-play opportunities for himself but also lighten the coverage load on his teammates.What’s adding fuel to the Falcons rumor fire is Hill’s reported weight drop this offseason. Shedding pounds to amplify his speed suggests he’s preparing for a fresh chapter — and possibly a new role in a different scheme. For a team like Atlanta, acquiring a version of Hill that’s even faster than before could be a franchise-altering move.Also Read: “Tua won’t get better”: Is Tua Tagovailoa’s contract the beginning of the Dolphins’ downfall? Should Hill make his way to Atlanta, it won’t just be a blockbuster trade — it would represent a bold shift in how the Falcons attack opponents.

Weeks after one of its professors, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, was arrested over a social media post he wrote on Operation Sindoor and the university was criticised for not taking a stand amid a raging argument over free speech, Ashoka trustee and co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani made his views clear in an emailed reply to a former student. Activism is not embedded to a liberal arts university, a political post on social media is not academic scholarship, and the founders have considered walking away, he asserted in the email.""Why don't you and other alumni offer to step in and take over?"" Bikhchandani wrote in the email that was shared on an internal mailing list. ""Pramath, Ashish and I have seriously discussed the option of walking away. Ashoka is too much of a headache... money, even in this day and age, does not grow on trees but it still makes the world go around,"" he added, referring to fellow trustee Pramath Raj Sinha and founding chairperson Ashish Dhawan.Dwelling at length on activism, he wrote, ""Activism and a Liberal Arts University are not joined at the hip. Ashoka is a Liberal Arts and Sciences University. Whether to be activists or not is a conscious choice people make.In the past I have questioned the activism at Ashoka — each time, I have been pounced upon by the activists and their supporters, both within and outside Ashoka: students, faculty, activists, etc.,saying that ‘if you are running a liberal arts university, then activism goes with the territory', that ‘I am an arrogant owner', that ‘dirty filthy capitalists don't understand how a university runs' (they somehow forget that the same capitalists are paying their salaries). """"You can be a great liberal arts university and not be activist. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar,"" he added. ""As an institution, Ashoka cannot take an activist position. It (Ashoka) is governed by the law of the land… It is answerable to regulators and to government authorities. It is not a political party or movement — it is an educational institution.""Addressing the row over Mahmudabad's post and his arrest without taking names, Bikhchandani wrote, ""A political opinion expressed on Facebook or Twitter (X) or Instagram is not academic scholarship. Consequently, any public outcry about a political opinion an academic may express on social media is not an attack on academic freedom... If a regulator or the government or law enforcement goes after you for a social media post, it is not an infringement of academic freedom. It might be an infringement of freedom of speech; however, there are provisions within the Constitution and the law where you can find protection. You are a grown-up adult. You are responsible for your actions and any consequences thereof. Ashoka is not obliged to support you for political opinions... You did not seek Ashoka's consent before posting on social media, you cannot now present Ashoka with a fait accompli and expect support.""""Appropriate timing of what to say, where, when and to whom and how is a sign of intelligence (beyond academic scholarship),"" he added. ""If you end up offending a whole bunch of people, even though you were not technically incorrect in what you said, then an expression of regret and an apology is a sign of good grace and decency. Hijacking an institutional platform to make it subordinate to your political agenda is an act of institutional capture and selfishness. Expecting the institution to then support you is an act of entitlement and arrogance.""In making these points, Bikhchandani identified a ""policy issue"" for Ashoka's governing body to think over. ""Can a full-time academic also pursue a political career? In the private sector, we generally stay away from what are termed as ‘politically exposed persons'. Should Ashoka have such a policy?""Mahmudabad, incidentally, has been associated with Samajwadi Party, though he has been inactive in recent years.","Ashoka trustee and co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani made his views clear in an emailed reply to a former student.

World Environment Day 2025: 7 ways to reduce your carbon footprint when buying beauty products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/world-environment-day-7-ways-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-when-buying-beauty-products/articleshow/121635970.cms,"The beauty industry's environmental impact is significant, but consumers can make planet-friendly choices. Opt for products with natural ingredients and certifications, support local brands to reduce transportation emissions, and minimize single-use packaging by choosing refillable or package-free options. Embrace multi-tasking and waterless products, research brand ethics, and practice mindful consumption to promote a more sustainable beauty routine.

Read the labels like a pro



Buy local, support small



Say no to single-use packaging



Multi-tasking products are eco superstars



Go waterless where you can



Check the brand’s sustainability ethics



#World Environment DayPlant trees, throw garbage in dustbins, discard plastics, and prefer walking: Celebs take steps to preserve the environment

Use less, finish more



Beauty that’s more than skin deep



Beauty may be skin deep, but its impact on the planet goes far beyond that. From plastic-heavy packaging to harmful production processes and long transportation chains, the beauty industry leaves a sizeable carbon footprint. As conscious consumers, we have the power to shift the narrative and make planet-friendly choices without compromising on our skincare or glam routines.On this World Environment Day, here’s how you can reduce your carbon footprint while shopping for beauty products:The journey to sustainable beauty begins with mindful ingredient choices. Harsh chemicals like parabens, phthalates, sulphates, and microbeads aren’t just harmful to your skin in the long run, they also damage ecosystems when they wash down the drain. Instead, opt for products with naturally derived, biodegradable ingredients that won’t pollute waterways.Look for third-party certifications. These aren't just buzzwords, they indicate that the product has met certain environmental standards in both formulation and production.When it comes to reducing your carbon footprint, the shorter the supply chain, the better. International beauty products may be tempting, but they often rack up air miles that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.Consider supporting local or regional brands that source and manufacture within your country. These often use locally available botanicals, reducing the energy needed for transportation.Bonus: buying local supports artisans, small businesses, and often results in fresher formulations.If your beauty routine includes dozens of plastic tubes, jars, and droppers, it’s time for a rethink. The beauty industry produces over 120 billion units of packaging every year, most of which ends up in landfills or oceans.To reduce your impact:Opt for refillable products whenever possible (think lipsticks, deodorants, perfumes).Choose brands that use glass, aluminium, or PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastic.Go package-free with solid shampoos, conditioners, and soaps.Support companies offering recycling return schemes.Do you really need a separate cream for your neck, face, and eyes? Often, the answer is no. Multi-use products reduce packaging waste, manufacturing resources, and shipping energy.Look for:Lip & cheek tintsBB creams with SPFAll-in-one serums (hydration + antioxidant + brightening)Cleansers that double as makeup removersNot only will your bathroom shelf thank you, but your travel bag will too.Water is a precious resource, and yet many skincare and haircare products are made up of up to 90% water. The extraction, treatment, and transportation of water adds to environmental strain. Waterless beauty is an emerging trend that helps mitigate this.Try products like:Powder-to-foam cleansersSolid shampoos and conditionersOil-based serums and moisturisersSheet mask alternatives like reusable cloth masksBy choosing waterless formats, you also get longer shelf lives and concentrated formulas that require less packaging.A brand’s marketing might be green, but what about their backend practices? Look beyond the product itself and research:Is the brand carbon-neutral or carbon-negative?Do they use renewable energy in production?Are their workers paid fair wages?Do they offset emissions through tree planting or verified carbon credits?Many ethical brands are transparent about their sustainability reports and list them on their websites. Supporting them means contributing to a cleaner, more equitable planet.It’s tempting to hoard makeup or jump on every new skincare trend, but overconsumption is one of the biggest environmental culprits. Instead of a “more is more” approach, shift your mindset to “quality over quantity.”Wait till you finish a product before buying another.Use the correct quantity to make your products last longer.Share products with a sibling or roommate to reduce wastage.Donate unopened, unused items to verified beauty banks.Minimalism isn’t just aesthetic, it’s sustainable.As beauty consumers, we don’t need to overhaul our entire routine overnight. But small, consistent changes can compound into a major impact. Choosing a refillable lipstick, supporting a local brand, or switching to solid shampoo are all steps that reduce emissions, conserve resources, and push the industry toward greener practices.","The beauty industry leaves a sizeable carbon footprint.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

Redefining luxury at Monaco Grand Prix 2025

The 2025 Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix weekend was a dazzling blend of racing, music, art, and luxury.

Celebrities and elite guests including Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, Dua Lipa, Sofia Vergara, and Odell Beckham Jr. turned Monaco into the ultimate playground of glitz and glamour. From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race.

Sponsors like RUMOR Rosé and Lewis Hamilton’s Almave spirit added to the upscale vibe. Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht. This event combined music, art, and philanthropy in an intimate, lively atmosphere. Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin. Leclerc mingled with fans as Ferrari’s signature red branding adorned the club in celebration of Nikki Beach’s 10th anniversary.This collaboration added a fashionable edge to the Grand Prix festivities and highlighted how Monaco continues to blend sport with luxury lifestyle in unique ways.The Monaco Grand Prix has always been synonymous with luxury and exclusivity, but this year’s events took it to new heights. From Jeff Bezos’ star-studded yacht party to Odell Beckham Jr.’s fusion of art and philanthropy, and Charles Leclerc’s stylish launch, Monaco 2025 was about more than racing.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST) The company is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names.

Kylie’s story highlights how reclaiming one’s body after childbirth is a gradual, sometimes frustrating journey — far from the quick “bounce back” image often portrayed.On her hit podcast Not Gonna Lie which has gained a steady following for its honest intakes, Kylie Kelce reflected more deeply on her postpartum recovery.She admitted, “I have worn my maternity jeans recently in the past couple of weeks, and I will continue to do it until I can button back up my old jeans.” She expressed a common but rarely voiced sentiment, “My body doesn’t feel like my body.”To help manage these feelings, Kylie shared the powerful advice her doctor gave her. “You grew a human for almost a year. Give yourself a year to settle back into your body.” This reminder is crucial, emphasizing patience and self-compassion during the postpartum phase, which can often be emotionally and physically taxing.While pregnancy brings a mix of emotions and physical changes, Kylie also shared a surprising and lighthearted “pregnancy superpower.” She described having an unusual ability to recognize celebrity voices in animated shows during pregnancy, something she humorously demonstrated when she identified Robert Irwin’s voice in an episode of Bluey.

As the UAE’s four-day Eid Al Adha holiday begins on Thursday, June 5, 2025, many wonder what happens if they are required to work during this public holiday. According to Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, Article 28, private sector employees are entitled to specific compensation for working on official holidays.Article 28 clearly states:If an employee works during any public holiday, the employer must compensate them by either:This law applies to all employees regardless of category or grade, as long as the employer has requested or required the employee to work during the holiday with permission.Senior Associate at Al Suwaidi and Company, Suneer Kumar, explained to Gulf News:“Article 28 of UAE Labour Law No. 33/2021 is applicable to all employees – irrespective of categories or grade – provided that the employer requested the employer to work or the work requirement necessitates the employee, with permission, to work during the public holidays. [Then the] employer will compensate them with another day of rest, in exchange for every day of holiday, or the employee will be paid the wages in respect of that day and will additionally be paid an excess of not less than 50 per cent of the basic salary for that day.If workers feel their rights are not being respected, or they have concerns about compensation for working on public holidays, they can contact the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE).

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Steve Ballmer , former CEO of Microsoft recently admitted how overconfidence in Windows prevented the software giant from capitalizing on the smartphone market. Speaking on the Acquired podcast, Ballmer said, “We were too confident,” as he reflected on Microsoft’s past strategy of pushing Windows into markets where it didn’t fit, instead of building solutions tailored to specific platforms. His remarks echoes with Android co-founder Rich Miner who – earlier this year – attributed Microsoft’s loss of smartphone wars to Android to Bill Gates ’s decision.In an X post in January, Rich Miner wrote “I literally helped create Android to prevent Microsoft from controlling the phone the way they did the PC - stifling innovation. So it's always funny for me to hear Gates whine about losing mobile to Android”.“I helped Orange launch the first Windows Mobile phone in 2002, the SPV. I worried MSFT might end up controlling mobile like they did the PC, I wanted something more open. So, sorry Bill, you're more responsible for losing the $400B than you realize,” he then stated.Stating that the company was “too confident”, Ballmer admitted on the podcast: “I don’t think we stuck with Windows too long. I think what we did is we tried to put Windows in places that it didn’t naturally go.”He pointed to Windows Mobile and automotive applications as key examples, where Microsoft's push to use Windows APIs and interfaces led to forced and unnatural user experiences.During the podcast, Ballmer revealed that Microsoft’s strategy was driven by a mix of “paranoia and confidence” in Windows, which the company saw as its “birthright” and “permission to enter” new markets. This mindset influenced its push into areas like media center applications and TV integration, where simplified versions of Windows struggled to match the performance and user experience of purpose-built solutions.","Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, recently admitted how overconfidence in Windows prevented the software giant from capitalizing on the smartphone market.

OnePlus 13s First Look: Compact flagship with NO compromises!

As the tech world races toward advanced forms of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Rumman Chowdhury , CEO of Humane Intelligence and former US Science Envoy for AI, has sent a strong message about the growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI). She emphasised that AI should not be used as a substitute for human thought.“If we start to say, ‘Well, the AI system is going to do the thinking for me,’ that is a failure state,” Chowdhury said in an interview, highlighting that AI systems are fundamentally limited by current human data and capabilities.“New and novel inventions, new and novel ideas don't come out of AI systems. They come out of our brains, actually. Not AI brains,” she added.Chowdhury also says that “AI is a tool, not a creator,” while referring to statements like AI could unlock major scientific breakthroughs, such as new treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's or cancer.“True innovation comes from human insight,” she added.Chowdhury also addressed the issue of AI reliability , pointing out how prompt design can influence a model’s output. She shared an instance when a chatbot gave medically inaccurate advice because the prompt was emotionally persuasive.“You find that the model actually starts trying to agree with you, because it’s trying to be helpful,” she said, adding, “That’s a big, glaring flaw.”The broader issue, according to Chowdhury, is people’s willingness to accept AI-generated answers without questioning the intent behind their queries.“Why do you need this information? What are you using it for?” she asked.“We are at a critical juncture. People are too ready to let AI do all the thinking, and that’s dangerous,” she noted.","Rumman Chowdhury is CEO of Humane Intelligence and former US Science Envoy for AI.

MrBeast plans a private island wedding

MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, has publicly declared his engagement to South African content creator Thea Booysen , opening up about his ultra-private romantic life. With a reputation for philanthropy-filled content, mind-blowing giveaways, and record-breaking stunts, MrBeast keeps his personal life under wraps online making such a post all the more significant to his fans.In a January 2025 social media post, Donaldson confirmed that he had proposed during the 2024 holiday season. Fans flooded the comments with excitement, celebrating the union of two creative powerhouses in the digital world.According to the ET reports, their relationship started in 2022, when Donaldson traveled to South Africa. It was over dinner, which their mutual friend had organized, that Booysen and Donaldson first laid eyes on each other. There was chemistry right from the start. Their rapport soon turned into frequent contact and eventually a full-fledged romance.By April 2022, they had made their first public appearance as a couple at the Kids' Choice Awards, validating what their fans had been speculating about for months.Thea Booysen, aka TheaBeasty, has built a reputation as an esteemed voice within the esports and gaming sector. In 2016, she started streaming on Twitch and YouTube, playing strategy card games. Her informative content, witty comments, and gaming knowledge gained her a devoted fanbase.She is also on the executive team of Nixuh, a South African gaming organization, helping to advance professional gaming in the country. Well beyond a content creator, Booysen's profile is a blend of creativity, intellect, and drive.Beyond the gaming sphere, Thea Booysen is an accomplished academic. Her academic credentials are:When she graduated with her master's, she posted a sentimental photo with Donaldson, exposing the caring relationship they have and displaying her versatile personality behind social media.Booysen is also a budding writer. In 2022, she released her first young adult book, The Marked Children, something that she wrote during her school days. The book is a testament to her creative writing, determination, and imaginative heart. This achievement is a testament to her potential to transcend genres from computer screens to pages demonstrating that her skills are as multifaceted as her passions.MrBeast and Thea Booysen together capture the spirit of a contemporary power couple. Theirs is not only a relationship founded on mutual affection but also a deep sense of what works for the digital environment. Both have created careers based on true engagement, intellectual growth, and large-scale projects.Thea Booysen told PEOPLE, ""In my mind, we're already married. We're already on the same page. We talk about children, how we're going to live together when we're 70 years old … this was just another step in the process.Their interaction is the start of a new chapter that not only romantically, but also possibly regarding co-ventures in content, commerce, or philanthropy. As the couple looks forward to their wedding, fans eagerly await what lies ahead. While MrBeast may be best known for his high-energy giveaways and global projects, this moment reveals the person behind the persona of someone who values connection, intimacy, and authenticity.MrBeast picked Christmas Day to get down on one knee, making the moment emotionally charged while keeping the occasion somewhat low-key. The timing was a nod to his need for intimacy despite his celebrity public life. As opposed to his usual bigger-than-life productions, this milestone leaned more toward authentic emotion than spectacle.According to the reports, the couple allegedly plans to hold a private wedding, perhaps on a private island, a move that again underscores their wish to keep part of their life out of the always-watchful eye of the internet. While MrBeast is a multi-millionaire with an international business empire, he jokingly admitted in a post that he didn't have much money available to fund his next wedding. He joked about turning to his mother for assistance, making for an endearing moment with fans.But don't get it twisted—his money is safe. Donaldson has a reputation for plowing almost all his earnings back into his content empire, which comprises YouTube channels, Feastables (his snack brand), a mobile game, a burger chain, and a production studio. His system is less about conventional saving and more about multiplying influence and building a long-term brand legacy.","MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, has publicly declared his engagement to South African content creator Thea Booysen.
