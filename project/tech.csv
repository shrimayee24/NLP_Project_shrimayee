Justin Vernon was moved by fans singing “Exile” without him onstage

Bon Iver Talks Collabs with Taylor Swift and Charli xcx and New Album SABLE, fABLE (Extended)

Singer-songwriter Justin Vernon , frontman of Bon Iver and long-time collaborator with Taylor Swift , recently reflected on a surreal moment tied to Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour . Appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 2, Vernon promoted his upcoming album SABLE, fABLE and opened up about the powerful experience of hearing thousands of fans belt out their duet “exile” at Swift’s live shows—even though he’s never performed it with her on that stage.When Jimmy Fallon brought up Taylor Swift’s live performances of “exile”—their hauntingly emotional track from her 2020 folklore album—Vernon was visibly moved. Describing the moment as “out of body, out of body,” he revealed how surreal it felt watching stadiums full of fans passionately sing the song he helped bring to life.“Sadly we didn’t ever get a chance to sing it with her on her tour,” Vernon said. “She got to come sing it with us but I saw those clips and I’m like, ‘Gosh, they sound better than one of me can sound.’”His admiration for Swift's audience didn’t stop there. Vernon called the entire experience “pretty powerful,” saying, “To just see that and to hear how that sounded. It was amazing.”Vernon’s relationship with Swift goes beyond one song. He also collaborated on the title track “evermore” from her 2020 sister album and has spoken warmly about their creative bond. In a past interview with The New Yorker, he described their first meeting as a surprisingly natural connection.“I was, like, ‘Wow, you’re somebody that I would have been very close friends with in high school,’” he shared. “‘You’re real and you’re here.’”Vernon continued, expressing his awe for Swift’s meteoric rise: “To see what she’s been up to, the propulsion, the expansion… I don’t know, it’s just unlike anything anyone’s ever seen. And yet there she was, this person who made a lot of sense to me.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s low-profile approach after Super Bowl and Grammys seen as strategic move by PR experts As Vernon revisits those emotional musical moments, he’s also looking forward to the release of SABLE, fABLE, Bon Iver’s fifth studio album, set to drop on April 11. With past collaborations and genuine connections like his with Swift, Vernon continues to bridge indie introspection with mainstream impact—proving that powerful music often starts from a place of deep authenticity.","Justin Vernon was moved by fans singing ""Exile"" without him onstage.

A-list celebration brings football icons and soccer royalty together in Miami

Tom Brady’s cheeky jab at Beckham sparks playful international debate

When legends collide, sparks fly—and that’s exactly what happened at David Beckham ’s extravagant pre-50th birthday party in Miami. Held ahead of the soccer icon’s milestone on May 2, the lavish event became an unexpected headline-grabber, thanks to none other than NFL legend Tom Brady and his cheeky sense of humor.The intimate yet star-studded gathering was thrown by Victoria Beckham and hosted in Miami, home to Beckham’s MLS club Inter Miami CF. The guest list included some of the most recognizable names in sports, such as Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and basketball icon Shaquille O’Neal. But it was Brady who stole the spotlight with his playful Instagram posts that reignited the never-ending “football vs. soccer” debate.Clad in a sharp tuxedo and all smiles next to the birthday boy, Brady posted, ""Happy 50th @davidbeckham. I'm glad we finally agreed it's called soccer not football,"" poking fun at the age-old transatlantic argument.The comment, lighthearted as it was, stirred the pot among fans from both sports worlds. Many soccer purists bristled at Brady’s “soccer” reference, while NFL followers applauded the GOAT for sticking to the American terminology.Later, Brady doubled down on the humor by sharing another Instagram Story with Beckham and Shaquille O’Neal, captioned, ""The backup goalies for @intermiamicf (Okay the backups to the backup).""While the party was buzzing with celebrities, sources say the vibe was surprisingly relaxed. According to Hollywood insider Rob Shuter, the event took place at a private, off-the-grid venue with minimal security and glam. Instead of flashing lights and red carpets, the focus was on authentic camaraderie, laughter, and celebrating Beckham’s legacy with close friends.Beckham’s early birthday bash wasn't just a glamorous affair—it became a moment where different sports cultures collided, and fans were reminded that even legends love to stir the pot, especially when there’s cake and champagne involved.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers future: The QB delays Steelers decision as Brett Favre's advice fuels hopes for a last-minute Vikings offer In true Brady fashion, the night wasn’t just about celebration—it was about making headlines.

Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral — but is it real,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/donald-trumps-death-prediction-on-april-12-in-the-simpsons-is-going-viral-but-is-it-real/articleshow/119979161.cms,"Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral

Did The Simpsons predict Donald Trump’s death? The truth behind the viral video

Viral Trump coffin scene from The Simpsons is AI-generated, not real

Similar incidents in the past

Why these fake predictions gain traction

Official response and fact-checking

In the digital age, viral videos and AI-generated content can blur the lines between fact and fiction. One of the latest topics gaining traction online involves a claim that the popular animated show The Simpsons predicted the death of former U.S. President Donald Trump on April 12, 2025. The video, shared across social media platforms, shows what appears to be a scene from the show depicting a Trump-like figure in a coffin surrounded by mourners—prompting many to speculate whether The Simpsons has once again made an eerily accurate prophecy.The popularity of The Simpsons and its history of making surprisingly accurate predictions—such as Donald Trump's presidency or the invention of smartwatches—have fueled the intrigue. However, as with many viral claims, it's important to examine the facts behind the video, verify its source, and understand whether there is any truth to the speculation.The video making the rounds claims to be a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump-like character lying in a coffin. The setting is somber, with political figures surrounding the casket, and the voiceover suggests that this represents Trump’s death on April 12, 2025. The timestamp and content are intended to reinforce the idea that the show predicted his death years in advance.Adding to the credibility for some viewers is The Simpsons’ reputation for making correct predictions about real-world events. However, this particular clip is not what it appears to be.According to Matt Selman, executive producer of The Simpsons, the specific scene shown in the viral clip never appeared in any episode of the series. In fact, there is no The Simpsons episode, old or recent, that features Donald Trump’s death or anything resembling the visuals used in the video.The image and footage in question have been confirmed to be photoshopped or AI-generated. In some versions, the words “R.I.P Donald Trump 1946–2024” appear, a telltale sign of digital manipulation. These visuals have been widely circulated on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, often accompanied by sensational music and misleading captions designed to provoke emotional reactions and maximize engagement.This isn’t the first time fake content involving The Simpsons and Donald Trump has gone viral. Since at least 2017, manipulated clips and images have circulated purporting that the show foresaw Trump’s death. Many of these posts resurface following real-world events involving the former president.For instance, a similar fake image went viral following an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024, falsely claiming that The Simpsons had shown his death in a previous season. Like the latest viral video, that image was also debunked by fact-checkers and producers associated with the show.The Simpsons has gained notoriety for seemingly accurate predictions, including Trump’s presidency (Season 11, Episode 17: ""Bart to the Future""), the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and the invention of devices resembling modern smartwatches. These accurate predictions have contributed to a belief among some viewers that the series is prophetic.However, the vast majority of these coincidences are either exaggerated, misunderstood, or—like the Trump death scene—fabricated. The show's vast number of episodes and its satirical nature naturally lead to scenarios that may eventually resemble real-world events. But that does not validate manipulated images or support predictions not backed by actual episodes.There has been no official confirmation from Fox or the creators of The Simpsons supporting the authenticity of the viral clip. Executive producer Matt Selman’s statements clearly refute any suggestion that such a scene exists in the show’s extensive catalogue. Independent fact-checking organizations have also debunked the claim, confirming that the video is digitally altered and not taken from any legitimate The Simpsons content.","A viral video claims to show a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump- like character lying in a coffin.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

Track fires won’t stop McLaren surge as Lando Norris shines in blazing Japanese GP practice runs



The final practice session at the Japanese Grand Prix turned out to be a dramatic affair, not just for the lap times but also due to an unexpected repeat of an unusual hazard — grass fires. Despite efforts from the FIA to mitigate Friday’s fire incidents, FP3 was again interrupted by two separate outbreaks, creating fresh concerns ahead of qualifying.Lando Norris, however, remained unfazed by the chaos and went on to set the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a 1:27.965s — a time that sealed McLaren’s dominance in practice. Oscar Piastri, his teammate, followed closely behind, just 0.026s adrift, reversing their positions from FP2 and setting the stage for a thrilling McLaren duel in qualifying.The top three were rounded out by Mercedes’ George Russell, who was a little over a tenth behind Norris. Russell looked like the most significant threat to the McLaren duo, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull ’s Max Verstappen completing the top five. Verstappen, notably, described his car as “undriveable” during parts of the session, highlighting Red Bull’s struggles on what has been a turbulent weekend at Suzuka.Despite FIA's assurances that “the grass has been cut as short as possible, and loose, dried grass has been removed from affected areas,” the measures didn’t fully prevent the fires from reoccurring. In fact, it took only seven minutes into FP3 for flames to appear between the hairpin and the Spoon Curve — near the optional chicane not typically used in Formula 1 races.Later, another fire at the high-speed 130R corner — reportedly triggered when Sauber driver Gabriel Bortoleto ran onto the grass — forced a second red flag, leaving just under seven minutes on the clock. With track safety now a serious concern, the FIA made the call not to resume the session, which denied drivers the opportunity to conduct critical practice starts.The persistent grass fires, which have already caused six red flags over two days, are proving to be more than just a minor distraction. They have now raised genuine worries about whether Saturday’s qualifying or even Sunday’s race could be compromised if the issue is not fully resolved.While McLaren celebrated a clean sweep of practice sessions, Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc looked quietly confident, and Verstappen, despite his complaints, still ended up fifth. Further down the order, Lewis Hamilton finished just behind Verstappen, followed by Williams’ Alex Albon and Alpine’s Pierre Gasly. Yuki Tsunoda was ninth, narrowly behind his Red Bull colleagues, while Isack Hadjar delivered another standout showing to complete the top ten.As teams gear up for qualifying, all eyes remain on McLaren's impressive pace—and whether the FIA’s fire-fighting measures will hold up under the spotlight.Also Read: FIA’s new circuit map aims to reduce F1 safety car delays during on-track stoppages","Lando Norris sets fastest lap of the weekend with 1:27.965.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Microsoft is now 50 years old. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, CEO Satya Nadella along with former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer , sat for a conversation led by an unexpected host—Copilot, the AI assistant developed by Microsoft. Sharing a video in an X post, Nadella wrote “Three Microsoft CEOs walk into a room on Microsoft’s 50th anniversary … and are interviewed by Copilot!”The conversation starts with Satya Nadella playfully prompting Copilot to “wrap it up by asking or maybe roast giving us each an AI roast ?”.Copilot replied “Alright, Satya. Let's spice it up.”Turning to Steve Ballmer first, the AI quipped, “Steve, we'll start with you. Your enthusiasm is legendary, but do you ever worry that your energy might short-circuit the AI? I mean, even robots need a coffee break after your pep talks.”To this, Ballmer responded, “Come on, dude. If you can’t handle me, you can’t handle a huge percentage of the world’s population. We’re counting on you.”In the 2-minute clip, Coploti asks: “Satya, AI seems to be your best buddy, but ever worry that your deep passion for AI could one day have it running the show, leaving you to just enjoy the ride?”. Nadella fired back with a grin, stating “Well, the day AI can play like the best cricket player that I enjoy, that’s the day it can run the show as far as I'm concerned.The AI assistant responds saying “Touche’ Satya, Let’s see if it can hit a century in cricket, and then we'll talk. This has been a blast, gentlemen. Here's to another 50 years of innovation and adventure. Cheers!”Turning to Bill Gates, Copilot asks if AI feels intimidated by his intense thinking face?. Gates responded “I hope so. I mean, that's all I've got left is these AIs get so damn intelligent. It's just that gaze and my willingness to criticize that differentiates me.”The AI assistant said, “And it's a formidable gaze indeed, Bill.” Steve said, “Copilot, would you ever be willing to criticise him?”“Absolutely. Criticism is where growth happens,” the AI quipped.In another X post, Nadella wrote “I'm eternally grateful to Bill and Steve and to Paul for what you've meant to me personally and the vision you had to build this extraordinary company of ours that I've had the privilege to be a part of.”“Thank You for your leadership, your passion, and for building the Microsoft that we know today.
