Exploding Pagers: How Israel’s Mossad convinced Hezbollah to buy its exploding pagers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-mossad-convinced-hezbollah-to-buy-its-exploding-pagers/articleshow/113980318.cms,"In a covert operation by Israel's Mossad , Hezbollah was convinced to purchase and distribute pagers to thousands of its operatives. The scheme was designed to infiltrate the group's communication system, ultimately leading to the deaths and injuries of many members.The story began two years ago when Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.The device in question, the AR924 pager , appeared to be an ideal tool for a militia group like Hezbollah. It was rugged, waterproof, and came with an oversized battery capable of lasting months without needing a recharge. The pagers were marketed as being immune to Israeli tracking, which appealed greatly to Hezbollah’s leaders, who were always wary of Israeli intelligence monitoring their communications.Follow: Live updates on Israel Hezbollah war In early 2023, Hezbollah made a bulk purchase of these pagers, convinced of their reliability. The devices were distributed to mid-level fighters and support personnel across Lebanon and Syria . What Hezbollah didn’t realise was that Mossad had designed the pagers themselves. Hidden within the battery pack of each device was a powerful explosive, which could be triggered remotely by Mossad or activated through a two-step process. The latter option involved pressing two buttons to decrypt messages, meaning the user would likely be holding the device with both hands when it detonated.On September 17, thousands of these pagers exploded simultaneously, killing or maiming an estimated 3,000 Hezbollah officers, fighters, and civilians. The operation is considered one of the most audacious and effective pieces of spycraft in recent history.Read more: How Israel's Mossad turned everyday pagers into deadly weapons against Hezbollah The plan originated in 2022 when Mossad, tasked with combating foreign threats to Israel, sought new ways to infiltrate Hezbollah, which had grown increasingly sophisticated in its communications.The organisation was desperate to avoid Israeli surveillance, and Mossad capitalised on this paranoia by offering Hezbollah what seemed to be secure, untraceable communication devices.To ensure the plan’s success, Mossad had to conceal the origins of the pagers. The devices were branded as Taiwanese and sold through a marketing official who had no knowledge of the true intent behind the sales. Hezbollah had been successfully misled into buying and distributing what were essentially bombs designed by their enemy.The first part of Mossad's pager plot was triggered on September 17. Explosions occurred simultaneously across Lebanon and Syria as Hezbollah operatives attempted to access encrypted messages. The two-step decryption process, which required both hands, ensured maximum casualties as fighters were directly exposed to the blasts. A day later, Mossad remotely triggered walkie-talkies that had been similarly booby-trapped, further adding to the chaos.This operation resulted in devastating consequences for Hezbollah, severely damaging its leadership and disrupting its communication networks. Israel followed up with airstrikes on Hezbollah’s key military infrastructure, intensifying the group's vulnerability. Despite the success of this operation, it also led to heightened tensions in the region, with Hezbollah and its backers, including Iran, retaliating and threatening further escalation.The attack is seen as a turning point in Israel’s ongoing conflict with Hezbollah, demonstrating the lengths Mossad is willing to go to neutralise threats and highlighting the profound risks of modern spycraft.","Israel's Mossad devised a plan to use pagers as a Trojan horse to penetrate Hezbollah's network.

The pink is due to a genetic mutation.""With infectious enthusiasm, Jamie explains the rarity of this encounter, noting that only 1% of people may have the chance to witness such a phenomenon in their lifetime.She goes on to reveal the scientific reason behind the grasshopper's unique coloration, attributing it to a genetic mutation that causes an overproduction of pink pigment and an underproduction of black.''Wow, I just found a pink grasshopper. There's like 1% of people can see pink grasshoppers in their lifetime. So, I am so lucky to be able to see it.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

With the growing influence of generative AI , India's quick commerce platforms are increasingly incorporating AI technology to enhance customer experiences and improve personalization. By deploying AI-driven tools, platforms such as Zomato , Swiggy , and BlinkIt have streamlined product recommendations, optimised delivery routes, and introduced virtual assistants to simplify user interactions.These advancements improve operational efficiency and cater to individual preferences. However, the adoption of AI also presents significant challenges, including high implementation costs and concerns surrounding data privacy, which these platforms must navigate while expanding their technological capabilities.Zomato introduced a personalised AI food assistant, available initially for Zomato Gold members. The AI assistant provides tailored restaurant and dish recommendations based on user preferences. It can answer specific queries, such as ""What should I eat when I’m hungover?"" or suggest low-carb, high-protein meals. Zomato's AI stack is built on OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs) and is powered through Microsoft Azure. Additionally, Zomato uses AI on the backend to optimise delivery times and improve customer support.However, Zomato has taken a firm stance against AI-generated content for restaurants, banning the use of AI-generated images in menus and promotional materials. The company has developed tools to detect such content, warning restaurants of removal if they fail to comply.BlinkIt, Zomato’s quick commerce arm, rolled out an AI-driven feature called ""Recipe Rover"" in May 2023. This tool helps users discover recipes and simplifies meal planning by offering curated recipe suggestions based on special occasions, such as Ganesh Utsav. The recipes also provide macro-nutrient information, making meal planning more health-conscious. Powered by Midjourney and OpenAI’s GPT models, Recipe Rover helps users not only find recipes but also directly source the ingredients needed.Swiggy launched its own AI-powered recommendation tool, ‘What to Eat,’ which personalises food suggestions based on user mood, past orders, and trending dishes. The neural search engine developed by Swiggy offers users transparency, explaining why specific recommendations are made. Swiggy plans to enhance this feature with voice-based and multi-language support, making it accessible across various regions of India.Swiggy is also focusing on optimising its operations through AI, with AI-powered route optimization for delivery agents. The company plans to introduce an AI chatbot to assist users within Dineout, as well as an AI-powered bot for restaurant partners to address onboarding and other operational concerns.Myntra, a leading fashion e-commerce platform, launched MyFashionGPT in partnership with Microsoft. This AI assistant goes beyond conventional keyword searches, allowing users to ask open-ended queries like ""Show me clothes for a beach vacation"" and receiving suggestions spanning multiple categories.

Nintendo surprised fans today by announcing not Switch 2 , but a $100 alarm clock, named Alarmo that brings Nintendo game sounds to your morning routine.Alarmo isn't just any alarm clock. It can sense your movements, letting you snooze or turn off the alarm without pushing buttons. The clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games like Super Mario Odyssey , Splatoon 3, Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild, Pinkmin 4, and RingFit Adventure to wake you up.You can choose between two main alarm types. ""Steady Mode"" gets louder if you don't wake up quickly. ""Gentle Mode"" keeps the same volume for a calmer wake-up. Alarmo plays sound effects as you wake up, sort of cheering you up to get up from bed, and the moment you are up, the alarm will stop automatically.There are a total of 35 different wake-up scenes, seven from each game -- that combines the music and sound. It will get even more sounds later on, adding music from Mario Kart and Animal Crossing games.Alarmo does more than just wake you up. It can play soft game music to help you fall asleep. It also tracks how much you move while sleeping, showing this information in its Records section.Some fans were hoping for news about a new game console. Instead, they got this playful alarm clock. It's an unusual move for Nintendo, but lately Nintendo is trying things beyond just making video games and consoles. Last month, they opened aNintendo museum in Kyoto, Japan. Now, with Alarmo, they're bringing their games into people's daily lives in a new way, which could make waking up a little less miserable.Nintendo Switch Online members in the US and Canada can buy Alarmo now, before anyone else. Other people will have to wait until next year to get one (and also for the Switch 2).","Alarm clock plays music and sounds from five Nintendo games to wake you up.

Ric Flair challenges critics to match his $1,000 donation

Ric Flair is not a stranger to getting backlash from the public, but his most recent controversy has stirred the pot quite a bit. Currently, people in Florida are fighting hard to safely survive Hurricane Milton that has already claimed 10 lives and is projected to cost almost $30bn to $50bn in property damage.Feeling bad about the state of things, Flair took to X and made a tweet about how he was sorry about the entire situation.Flair mentioned that it doesn’t feel right for him to enjoy his fame while his people in Tampa are fighting for survival. Ric then went on to say that while he can’t make a $100,000 donation, he would be more than willing to donate $1,000 to any Tampa based charity.Flair also mentioned that he is ready to send free energy drinks from his own brand to help keep the energy up, as he went on to praise the efforts of his grandson and other volunteers. Ric faced heavy backlash for seemingly plugging in his energy drink while people are losing their lives, and has since deleted his tweet. But, he still wasn’t done addressing the haters.

He also challenged many internet trolls to show up with their real names since he can’t have a conversation with them, without being able to google them.Clearly, Flair has not reacted well to all the criticism he’s been facing. While Ric’s intentions may have been pure, it is quite clear to see that his tweet was in bad taste. A simple message of support would’ve done the job, but Flair chose to plug his energy drink brand into a hurricane relief message.

Aaron Rodgers is putting the mess the New York Jets are in on himself

Aaron Rodgers blames the New York Jets for firing head coach Robert Saleh and demotioning offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, stating that he plays better and doesn't cause the problems. Rodgers attributed the situation to his own performance. The Jets currently rank 27th in total offense with 286.6 yards per game, 19th in passing offense with 206.2 yards per game, and dead last in rushing offense with 80.4 yards per game.Also Read: ""Sam is an absolute baller”: Minnesota Vikings Fullback C.J.

""The word that goes along with that is accountability. We need to be accountable to each other. When something like this happens, it's a reset for everybody. … If I play better, this doesn't happen. We play better, on offense, this doesn't happen.

""As far as any of the ridiculous allegations out there, I'm not going to spend more than one sentence in response to it,"" he said.

I love Robert.”The Jets have fired Saleh and interim coach Jeff Ulbrich has given offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett an undisclosed role, a move that was made due to Rodgers' close relationship with Hackett.
