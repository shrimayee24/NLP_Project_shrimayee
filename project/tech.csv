Traffic cameras must catch picture of distracted drivers: SOP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-cameras-must-catch-picture-of-distracted-drivers-sop/articleshow/120267063.cms,"NEW DELHI: Centre wants states and local agencies to ensure cameras used for detecting traffic rule violations are capable of catching people not wearing seatbelt or helmet, driving on the wrong side, using mobile phone, and eating and drinking while driving, among other offences.The cameras should also be able to capture videos, even if vehicles are at 200kmph, state the SOP for electronic enforcement of motor vehicles law across states and UTs, which was submitted to SC by road transport and highways ministry. The SOP aims at preventing a large number of road crashes and fatalities due to wrong-side and distracted driving.The SOP was prepared following an SC order directing 23 states and 7 UTs to file compliance reports indicating the implementation of electronic monitoring as provided in central Motor Vehicles Act. The automated camera enforcement system of traffic rules is the default mode for electronic enforcement and generating prosecutable evidence, focusing on accountability of violators and enforcement agencies.As per the submitted SOP, the cameras installed should automatically generate evidence of distracted drivers, particularly of those using mobile phones, eating or drinking and not wearing seatbelt. The cameras should capture an offence, including a one second to 10 seconds video having vehicle, location, time and date details, without motion blur. The system needs to process violations within ""one"" second and generate real-time alerts for enforcement authorities.In case of driving against the flow of traffic, the system will need to use cameras, sensors and advanced algorithms to detect the violation automatically. It should be able to differentiate between actual violations and permitted movements, such as those of police, ambulance, fire brigade. It must capture high-resolution images of the violating vehicle and a five-second video before and after detection of violation.Similarly, to rein in vehicle owners and drivers who change phone numbers and addresses to evade paying fines, the ministry will have a one-time three-month window to verify and update the details, and after that it will be a prerequisite for availing any transport and driving licence-related services. The SOP specifies setting up of online systems across states to enable drivers and vehicle owners to challenge challans issued by traffic police or transport officials.","The cameras should also be able to capture videos, even if vehicles are at 200kmph, state the SOP for electronic enforcement of motor vehicles law across states and UTs.

"In Bihar, girls pedal their way to script a new future",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-bihar-girls-pedal-their-way-to-script-a-new-future/articleshow/120266728.cms,"PATNA: Every morning, Raushani Kumari pedalled 15km on bicycle through dusty roads from her village to school in Vaishali to fulfil her dream of becoming a top MNC executive. Daughter of an autorickshaw driver, she turned every obstacle into fuel, not just to survive, but to shine. Today, she stands tall as Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) Class XII commerce topper.Aarti Kumari, a Class IX student of Basuham village in Darbhanga, embodied a similar spirit of tenacity. ""Sometimes, I would miss classes because it was too tiring. The cycle changed everything. I reached on time, attended every class & even helped my younger sister with her studies.""Like Raushani and Aarti, there are hundreds of other girls who come from quiet lanes and crowded classrooms, from families where dreams once took a backseat to daily survival. But powered by ambition and fuelled by a wave of progressive govt schemes, including one where girls from humble backgrounds were given bicycles for mobility, Bihar's girls and women are rewriting the rules.In a display of talent and tenacity, girls from small towns and extremely poor families have swept the top ranks in this year's Intermediate and matric exams across all streams.The Class X results speak volumes. Out of 123 students who clinched top-10 positions this year, 60 were girls. In 20 out of Bihar's 38 districts, girls were declared district toppers. In several districts, they swept all three top positions. Of the 15.58 lakh students who appeared for the exam, 8.05 lakh were girls - outnumbering boys - and 80.67% of them passed. Among them, 2.17 lakh scored first division while over 2.5 lakh secured second division and 1.7 lakh passed with third division.Intermediate results echoed the same story. Girls outperformed boys. In arts stream, nine out of 13 top-five rank holders were girls. In commerce, six of top seven belonged to them. And in science, girls bagged three of eight top-five spots. In total, 18 out of 28 top-five rank holders across all three streams were girls.","In a display of talent and tenacity, girls from small towns and extremely poor families have swept the top ranks in this year's Intermediate and matric exams.

30kW DEW Targets Drones & Missiles at 3.5 km,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-laser-system-to-destroy-aerial-targets/articleshow/120266057.cms,"NEW Delhi: India for the first time on Sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors, joining a select group of countries like the US, Russia, China, UK and Israel in the quest for effective Star Wars-like directed energy weapons (DEWs).The multiple tests of the Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) to destroy a small fixed-wing aircraft and a swarm of seven drones as well as “blind” surveillance cameras and sensors mounted on drones and deployed on the ground, at ranges up to 3.5-km, were conducted at the national open air range at Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh.“It is a very powerful and reusable weapon for 'beam kills’, instead of ‘kinetic kills’ with expensive missiles and ammunition. With low cost per kill, it’s much more economical, especially for extended wars like we are now seeing. This is the technology of the future,” DRDO director-general (electronics and communication systems) Dr B K Das told TOI.The 30-kilowatt vehicle-based integrated drone detection and interdiction system (IDD&IS) marks a significant breakthrough for India, which has lagged far behind other countries in developing such cost-effective counter-drone systems.The challenge will be to miniaturise the system for deployment on airborne platforms and warships as well. The armed forces have so far inducted 23 IDD&IS systems, with 2-kilowatt lasers, for around Rs 400 crore, with DRDO also completing the development of 10-kilowatt lasers. But their kill ranges are just about 1 to 2-km, as reported by TOI earlier.“The Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) was tested for a 3.5-km range in hot weather or extreme conditions on Sunday. User trials can take place in 1-1.5 years, with technology being transferred by DRDO to companies for production,” Dr Das said.With the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems and the fast emergence of deadly drone swarms as asymmetric threats, DRDO is now also working on DEWs with power levels of 50 to 100-kilowatt as well as high-energy microwaves, as per a roadmap laid down with short, medium and long-term goals.“Cost-effective defence solutions to tackle low-cost drone attacks is driving the adoption of DEWs by militaries worldwide. The cost of firing a DEW for a few seconds is equivalent to the cost of a couple of litres of petrol. Therefore, it has the potential to be a long-term and low-cost alternative to defeat a variety of targets,” another DRDO official said.Some countries are far ahead in this arena. The US, for instance, has already deployed Helios’ (high energy laser with integrated optical-dazzler and surveillance), with a 60-kilowatt laser that can be scaled up to 120-kilowatt, on some of its frontline warships to intercept armed drones, missiles and fast-attack craft.Israel, in turn, is getting set to deploy a 100-kilowatt Iron Beam’ laser weapon system with a 10-km range, while the UK is developing Dragon Fire’ for its warships.While firing focussed beams of concentrated electromagnetic energy at the speed of light at targets may be much cheaper than conventional kinetic weapons, DEWs are still to enter large-scale operational use.The kill ranges of DEWs are still far less than conventional weapons, and bad weather can adversely impact their performance. “Advancements in technology will lead to more powerful and versatile weapons. One such advancement is the development of more powerful and efficient lasers, allowing for greater range and precision. Additionally, advancements in beam-steering technology and adaptive optics may enhance the DEW’s ability to maintain focus and accuracy at longer ranges,” a DRDO scientist said.","India for the first time on Sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely- piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors.

Seven months ago, Manisha Roy, 35, a resident of Hebbal, decided to replace her cook with a kitchen robot. She says she is better off now.Their dining out days have also reduced since the robot came. Her husband Naveen and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Nakshatra enjoy the robot-prepared poha, pav bhaji, and rice with rajma masala.“My kitchen robot can chop, sauté, fry, stir, steam and knead,” says Manisha. The automated device comes equipped with numerous pre-programmed recipes. Users need only follow the given directions, add the required ingredients and select the appropriate settings. The machine then handles the remaining process independently. Manisha operates the robot using a mobile app. The application shows instructions in sequence. ""I just add the ingredients shown on the panel, as per the pre-loaded recipe. I don't even have to be around while the robot performs the tasks, such as cutting vegetables or frying them,” she says.The robot allows her to multitask while cooking. “While cooking manually the traditional way, if you do other chores like folding clothes, the food may get burnt. Now I do other household chores while the food is getting ready, because I know my food won't be charred,"" she says.The difficulty of getting house-help, their increasing costs, and the hassle of managing them and their timings are pushing many households to look at alternatives. And automated devices and robots are proving to be almost transformative. These machines are taking over domestic tasks like floor cleaning, cooking and dishwashing.Meera Vasudev, a Bengaluru-based architect, uses two different kinds of robots for jhadoo pocha. “We also have a wireless vacuum cleaner. And I do the cooking by myself,” says Meera, who has been living without a maid for the last 18 months.One of the robots cleans surface dirt and can handle carpets. It navigates around clutter and under furniture, and returns to its charging dock when finished. However, Meera says, it struggles with thicker carpet varieties. The other robot performs floor mopping functions. It contains a water storage compartment that releases water while moving across the floor with an attached mopping cloth. However, it cannot remove stubborn stains.Wireless vacuum cleaners today are light and easy to operate. You don’t have to bend, like when you use a broom. They also pick up fine dust that a broom may not. Some come with a variety of attachments for use on different kinds of surfaces, including glass, blinds, carpets, and ceilings.Renuka Gurunathan, 43, from Koramangala, adopted automated cleaning solutions, including a dishwasher and a floor cleaning robot, during the pandemic period. “Not depending on an outsider for your daily life is truly a liberating experience,” she says.But she does employ occasional domestic assistance for thorough cleaning tasks a few times annually. “The practice of hiring professional cleaners for periodic deep cleaning, similar to the American approach, should be adopted more widely,” she says.For Manisha, her kitchen robot is proving to be more cost-effective than keeping a cook. “I was not happy with my house help,” says the postgraduate in bioscience who works as a research associate in Clarivate. “I used to pay her Rs 2,500 a month, but would end up doing a lot of the work myself. Now I’m saving a lot – up to Rs 9,000 a year,” she says. The cooking robot costs around Rs 40,000, but Manisha says it still makes financial sense to invest in it.She gets up at 7.30am, and does most of her cooking using the robot. “The robot makes cooking fun, faster and easier,” she says.Manisha also uses a multifunctional electric pressure cooker, which she finds particularly suitable for rice-based dishes, including biryani. ""The chicken biryani it makes is as flavourful and delicious as the authentic, restaurant-style biryani,"" she says, adding that it does not require much time, and “even a 10-year-old kid can operate it.”The new technologies are also changing traditional household dynamics, and breaking gender stereotypes. Smart appliances are encouraging men to lend a hand in household chores. Multiple people we spoke to said men often like to use these tech devices, including kitchen robots and wireless vacuum cleaners. Naveen, for instance, is passionate about technology, and the kitchen robot has stimulated in him a new interest in culinary activities. “He makes delicious meals using the robot and is thrilled with the results it produces,” Manisha says.We use a cooking robot. It’s more cost-effective than keeping a cook, and it has also helped in making my husband develop an interest in culinary activities. I manage sweeping and mopping mostly by myself. My husband chips in with cleaning from time to time. We also utilise a professional cleaning service for thorough bathroom maintenance, which costs Rs 500 per session.In our apartment complex, many are using robots for cleaning, but they have maids for other purposes like child care, dog walking.Robotic cooking appliances in India currently require human supervision and interaction. A genuine robotic system should operate independently after receiving instructions, completing tasks without requiring user intervention during the process. Floor cleaning robots , however, do a good job. I bought one during the Covid period, and find it quite satisfactory. It cleans better than a maid but its functionality is limited to horizontal surfaces. So you’d still need a maid for vertical surface cleaning and dusting. I’m hoping once my son becomes a teenager, I can do without maids.I’m a homemaker. I live with my in-laws, husband, and children. I bought a cooking robot in January. When I decided to replace my maid with a robot, my family was a bit apprehensive. But now they all like the meals made by the robot. It has also made life much easier for me. My elder daughter, Aaradhya, comes back home from school by noon. She loves the pulao prepared by the robot. It takes just an hour to make a good meal. After putting the ingredients into the robot, I keep moving here and there.I prefer robots to maids. They are way more reliable. They are easier to manage too. My cooking robot costs around Rs 40,000. It’s a one-time investment and it’s really worth it.Despite owning washing machines, many continue to have their domestic workers manually wash clothes by hand. While household appliances can handle cleaning tasks, domestic workers remain essential for numerous responsibilities. They are still indispensable for cooking and providing care for both young children and senior family members. I don’t look at technology as a deterrent.What I oppose is the non-regulation of domestic work and the exploitation of domestic workers through tech. Startups should look at creating algorithms that help workers with wage calculations and provide them salary slips.","The difficulty of getting house-help, their increasing costs, and the hassle of managing them and their timings are pushing many households to look at alternatives.

Guide on obtaining Coca Leaves in Schedule 1

How to Make/cook Cocaine in Schedule 1 Game - How to use Cauldron

Unlocking Salvador Moreno

Purchasing Coca Seeds and cultivating into Coca Leaves

Harvesting and processing Coca Leaves

In Schedule 1 , you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire. When it comes to cocaine production, you will need to get Coca Leaves, which can be cultivated from Coca Seeds.However, these seeds aren’t readily available, and are a premium commodity. You will first have to unlock the exclusive dealer named Salvador Moreno, and then order these seeds from him. The guide below will walk you through the process of acquiring Coca Seeds, cultivating them into Coca Leaves, and processing them.To get started, you need to unlock Salvador Moreno, who is the exclusive supplier of Coca Seeds. The supplier operates from the Docks area, and you will have to reach the Enforcer I rank to unlock the same. To achieve the particular rank, you must expand your empire and successfully manage your operations in the other regions.After Docks is open for you, the next thing to do is establish connections with either Javier Perez or Mac Cooper. They will introduce you to Salvador Moreno, and you may then arrange the purchase of Coca Seeds in Schedule 1.As already stated, Coca Seeds are a premium commodity in Schedule 1, and you will have to pay the big bucks to acquire them. If you are ordering them through a dead drop, each seed will cost you $80, and there will be a purchase limit of $2,000 or 10 seeds per transaction. Alternatively, in-person purchases will require you to spend $150 per seed. These seeds will be a significant investment, so you must plan your finances correctly.Once you have got your hands on Coca Seeds, you must start with the cultivation. Planting them follows the same procedure as other seeds that you generally acquire from Albert. All you have to do is set up a grow tent or pot with soil, remove the seed cap, and plant the seed.If you've hired a Botanist in Schedule 1, the process becomes even easier. You must simply put the Coca Seed on an appropriate rack and assign the supplies. The Botanist will take up the entire growth process and would ensure optimal yield.You'll finally have mature Coca Leaves ready for harvest. After harvesting, you can transform these leaves into a sellable product by processing them in a Cauldron. The particular equipment is available upon reaching Enforcer I, and you can purchase it from Oscar for $3,000.Upon setting up the Cauldron, you can begin processing the Coca Leaves, with the standard recipe requiring 20 Coca Leaves and 1 unit of Gasoline. For a higher-quality output, you can also consider drying the Coca Leaves on a drying rack.Additionally, to completely streamline the production, you can consider hiring staff. A fully automated production for the particular drug requires you to have one Botanist, three Handlers, and four Chemists.","In Schedule 1, you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire.

Read Nithin Kamath’s complete post here

Good time to follow this advice. Over the next 10 days, there are only 4 trading days. It’s not a bad idea to take a break from trading and recharge. Judging by what’s happening, you’re going to need it.

""Trading profitably requires that you monitor the market moods and your psychological moods. When either one is not conducive to trading, it’s best to stand aside and wait for the situation to change. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you should trade even in these potentially debilitating conditions.

Zerodha CEO and co-founder Nithin Kamath has advised investors to step back from trading during the upcoming shortened trading weeks. In a post on X, Kamath pointed to increased market volatility and stressed the need for mental clarity and preparation to trade profitably.Kamath pointed out that over the next 10 days, there are only four trading days due to stock market holidays for Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Jayanti and Good Friday. He suggested that investors use this period to recharge and avoid trading in ""potentially debilitating conditions."" Kamath wrote, ""Judging by what’s happening, you’re going to need it.""Drawing from Zerodha Varsity, the company's investor education platform, Kamath shared insights on trading psychology . He emphasised that successful trading requires monitoring both market moods and personal psychological states. ""When either one is not conducive to trading, it’s best to stand aside and wait for the situation to change,"" he quoted.Kamath also warned against the mistake of trading during unfavourable conditions, stating, ""By staying out of the markets, you can survive to trade another day, when you’re in a peak performance mental state and the market conditions are optimal.""As investors consider Kamath's advice, the focus remains on maintaining resilience and making informed decisions during challenging times.Recently, Zerodha launched Portfolio Performance Curve on Console.

While ChatGPT itself cannot generate images, it can help you guide you in crafting precise prompts to use with AI image generation tools like DALL·E, Midjourney and others. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, including the best prompts to achieve that iconic Barbie aesthetic -- think vibrant colors, glamorous outfits, and a polished, doll-like vibe.AI Barbie trend involves social media users uploading a photo of themselves to ChatGPT, which then designs a packaged Barbie doll based on their appearance. Users also request the bot to add personal touches, like coffee mugs or pets, reflecting items from their daily lives. The outcome is a strikingly realistic custom Barbie doll that seems ready for purchase.Choose a clear, well-lit image of yourself, a friend, or even a pet you want to transform.Use ChatGPT to refine promptsTools like DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion to create the final image.Select a high-quality photo with good lighting and a visible subject (face or full body works best). The clearer the image, the easier it is for AI tools to interpret details. If you’re uploading the photo to an AI tool, ensure it’s in a common format like JPEG or PNG.ChatGPT can help you write detailed, specific prompts for image generators. Describe your goal: Turning your photo into a Barbie-style doll. Here’s how to interact with ChatGPT:Example Input to ChatGPT: “I want to turn a photo of a person into a Barbie-style doll using an AI image generator. Can you help me create a detailed prompt that captures the Barbie aesthetic—glossy hair, vibrant outfits, and a plastic-like doll finish?”Below are some ready-to-use prompts optimized for AI image generators. Adjust them based on your photo’s subject (e.g., swap “woman” for “man” or “pet” if needed).“A hyper-realistic Barbie doll based on a [describe subject, e.g., young woman with long brown hair], with smooth, glossy skin, large sparkling eyes, and a bright smile. She wears a vibrant pink ball gown with glittery accents, high heels, and a tiara. Her hair is styled in voluminous waves, with a plastic-like sheen. The background is a dreamy pastel pink studio with soft lighting, giving a toy-box aesthetic. Ultra-detailed, 4K resolution.”“A Barbie-style doll version of [describe subject, e.g., a person with short blonde hair], with flawless, porcelain-like skin and bold makeup (pink lipstick, dramatic eyelashes). Dressed in a trendy, colorful jumpsuit with statement jewelry and stiletto boots. The pose is confident, hands on hips, with a glossy, plastic-like texture. Set against a chic city skyline backdrop at sunset, vibrant and polished, cinematic lighting, 8K quality.”“A magical Barbie doll inspired by [describe subject, e.g., a woman with curly red hair], with an ethereal glow, sparkling blue eyes, and a doll-like finish. She wears a flowing, iridescent mermaid-style dress with gemstone details and a crown. Her hair cascades in shiny, toy-like curls. The background is a whimsical fantasy forest with glowing flowers, rendered in a vibrant, hyper-detailed style, 4K resolution.”“A cute Barbie-style doll version of [describe pet, e.g., a fluffy white dog], transformed into an anthropomorphic toy with big, shiny eyes and a plastic-like sheen. Dressed in a tiny pink tutu and bow, with a sparkly collar. The pose is playful, standing upright like a doll. Background is a colorful toy store shelf with pastel props, ultra-realistic, 4K quality.”Pro Tip: Add “inspired by a photo of [subject]” to the prompt if the AI tool allows photo uploads for reference. For example, “A Barbie doll inspired by a photo of a woman with long black hair…”Sign into your chosen AI image tool (e.g., Midjourney via Discord, Stable Diffusion’s web interface, or DALL·E through OpenAI’s platform). Follow these steps:Some tools allow you to upload a reference image. Check the tool’s guidelines for how to integrate it.Copy your ChatGPT-crafted or provided prompt into the text field.Set the resolution to high (e.g., 4K or 8K if available) and choose a style like “hyper-realistic” or “cinematic” for that polished Barbie look.Run the prompt and wait for the output. It may take a few seconds to minutes.For extra polish, you can use editing software to enhance your Barbie doll images. Apply a slight blur or airbrush effect for that plastic-doll finish. You can use Canva or Photoshop to add glittery effects to outfits or backgrounds.","ChatGPT can help you write detailed, specific prompts for image generators.

NYC Helicopter Crash: All red alerts ignored? Doomed NYC chopper that killed Agustin Escobar reported mechanical issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-red-alerts-ignored-doomed-nyc-chopper-that-killed-agustin-escobar-reported-mechanical-issue/articleshow/120236268.cms,"Siemens executive Agustin Escobar and his family's last photo before they were killed in the NYC helicopter crash.

What directives did the FAA issue for the model?



What did New York Helicopter Tour CEO say?



The Hudson River helicopter tragedy points to the mismanagement of the private company New York Helicopter Tour as reports have now revealed that the helicopter reported a mechanical issue months before. Siemens executive Agustin Escobar , his wife and three children were killed when the helicopter broke midair and nosedived into the murky water of the Hudson river minutes after flying.The ill-fated Bell206L-4 LongRanger IV aircraft, owned and operated by New York Helicopter, experienced a mechanical issue with its transmission assembly last September, according to Federal Aviation Administration data. Records show the doomed chopper was built in 2004 and had already logged 12,728 hours of flight time when it was forced into repair.The Big Apple company has come on the radar after this recent tragedy, as this is not the first one involving the company. The pilot's experience and the wreckage of the helicopter are also under scrutiny. Investigators will also review the maintenance work that was done on the doomed aircraft, including the completion of two recent safety airworthiness directives the FAA issued on Bell 206L model helicopters.The federal agency issued the first directive in December 2022 and called for the inspection and possible replacement of the models’ main rotor blades due to “delamination” — an issue with the internal layers of the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage or other defects, the New York Post reported.A second directive, issued in May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor shafts on eight models, including the one involved in Thursday’s deadly wreck, according to the FAA, which issued the alert after a chopper lost a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.In 2013, a Bell 206 chopper carrying four Swedish tourists crash-landed in the Hudson, though the pilot and the other passengers miraculously survived. At that time the company CEO Michael Roth said he had no clue what happened. After Thursday's tragedy again, Roth said he did not know what happened. “The only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren’t on the helicopter. And I haven’t seen anything like that in my 30 years being in business, in the helicopter business,” he said.","The ill-fated Bell206L-4 LongRanger IV aircraft, owned and operated by New York Helicopter, experienced a mechanical issue with its transmission assembly last September.

Poll Do you support the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for European visitors to the UK? No Yes

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

The Trump administration in US has announced that smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and other advanced electronics will be excluded from its latest round of global tariffs.The update, shared in a Saturday notice by the US Customs and Border Protection office, aims to reduce cost burdens on American consumers while softening the blow of wide-ranging tariff hikes, particularly targeting China.This move represents a partial step back from the administration’s tough “reciprocal tariffs” policy, as it tries to balance trade pressure with concerns over rising domestic inflation.Notably, these products may be subject to future duties. These exemptions represent a somewhat favourable outcome for technology companies such as Apple. As per data from Evercore ISI, Apple manufactures over 80% of its products in China, including 80% of iPads and more than half of its Mac computers.","The update, shared in a Saturday notice by the US Customs and Border Protection office, aims to reduce cost burdens on American consumers while softening the blow of wide-ranging tariff hikes, particularly targeting China.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Kraft Heinz joins the 'Saucy fun'

Education Secretary Linda McMahon reportedly caused a stir at the ASU+GSV Summit recently when she repeatedly confused artificial intelligence (AI) with A1, the popular steak sauce, during a panel on educational innovation. As reported by USA Today, McMahon, 76, initially used the term AI correctly, stating, “AI development – how can we educate at the speed of light if we don’t have the best technology around to do that?” However, her remarks soon veered off course. “A school system that’s going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year. That’s a wonderful thing!” she said, prompting chuckles from the audience.She continued, “Kids are sponges. They just absorb everything. It wasn’t all that long ago that it was, ‘We’re going to have internet in our schools!’ Now let’s see A1 and how can that be helpful.”The gaffe didn’t go unnoticed. A.1. Sauce, owned by Kraft Heinz, seized the moment with a cheeky Instagram post featuring a bottle of their product and the caption, “You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.” The post added, “Agree, best to start them early.” Fans loved the response, with one commenter noting, “I will be buying a bottle or two because of this post.”Online, the mix-up became fodder for jokes. One Twitter user quipped, “Education Secretary Linda McMahon keeps referring to AI as A1 and talking about how it will help ‘students at all levels.’ But how can we get those kids to drink it? Linda added, ‘The smarter kids can move up to Thousand Island Dressing.’”The Kraft Heinz-owned brand A.1. Sauce joined the fun.
