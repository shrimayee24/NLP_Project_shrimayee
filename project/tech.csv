Muted microphones to ensure civility

Speaking format and debate structure

Strict rules on props and interaction

High stakes in a close race

In what is shaping up to be a historic and highly anticipated showdown, US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night. The event marks the first time the two will directly face off as they vie for the presidency in what has become a closely contested race.The debate, which will be hosted by ABC, follows weeks of heated negotiations between the two campaigns regarding the format, rules , and logistics.As the campaigns sharpen their strategies, voters are eager to witness the direct exchange of ideas and positions between two of the country’s most prominent political figures.The debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a fitting location given its historical significance in American democracy. The 90-minute event is scheduled to start at 9:00 pm local time on Tuesday (6.30 IST Wednesday), and it will be aired live across major networks. Unlike previous debates, this one will take place without an audience in the room, an effort to minimize distractions and ensure the focus remains solely on the candidates.Moderating the debate will be ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, both seasoned journalists known for their sharp questioning and ability to handle tense moments. The debate will feature two commercial breaks, offering brief pauses during what promises to be a charged exchange.One of the most hotly debated topics leading up to the event was whether microphones would be muted, a feature used in the past to prevent interruptions. This issue reignited tensions between the campaigns, with each side accusing the other of dodging tough questions. Trump’s team argued against mic muting, claiming it stifles free speech, while Harris’s camp pointed to past debates where constant interruptions derailed meaningful discussion.ABC ultimately decided that each candidate’s microphone would be live only during their allotted speaking time. When one candidate is speaking, the other’s mic will be muted, ensuring a smoother exchange. Only the moderators will have the authority to ask questions, and no topics or questions have been shared with the candidates beforehand, further adding to the anticipation surrounding the event.There will be no opening statements from the candidates, a departure from typical debate formats. Instead, the candidates will dive directly into answering questions, with each given two minutes per question to state their position. Following this, their opponent will have two minutes to rebut, creating an opportunity for direct engagement on each topic. An additional minute will be provided for follow-ups, clarifications, or further responses, allowing both Trump and Harris to refine their arguments or counter the other’s claims.At the end of the debate, both candidates will have the chance to deliver two-minute closing statements, with Trump going last due to the result of a virtual coin toss. This structure ensures that each candidate will have ample time to make their case while maintaining the debate’s brisk pace.To maintain a level playing field and avoid theatrics, the debate will follow strict rules regarding props and materials. Both candidates will stand behind podiums for the entire duration of the event, and neither will be allowed to bring props or pre-written notes to the stage. They will be equipped with only a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water. This eliminates any opportunity for one candidate to gain an advantage through visual aids or pre-prepared statements.Additionally, campaign staff will not be permitted to communicate or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks, reinforcing the expectation that Harris and Trump must rely solely on their own preparation and quick thinking.This debate comes at a critical juncture in the election, as polls show a dead heat between the two candidates. For Trump, the event represents an opportunity to demonstrate his continued appeal to voters and defend his record in office. For Harris, the debate is a chance to solidify her position as a presidential contender and challenge Trump’s policies head-on.With the nation watching, both candidates are expected to come prepared for a fiery exchange. The outcome of the debate could shape the direction of the race in its final weeks, making it a must-watch event for voters on all sides of the political spectrum.","US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn’t see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry’s memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry’s depiction of Kate Middleton’s supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108805388,imgsize-32690,width-400,resizemode-4/108805388.jpg"
Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Musk’s vision: Transforming X into a multimedia powerhouse

Future integrations and expectations

Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla Motors and visionary entrepreneur, has once again made headlines by launching the beta version of X TV , a new feature within the X app (formerly known as Twitter). This innovative addition is set to transform the way users consume films, live content, and recorded shows, all within the X ecosystem. By reducing reliance on external media platforms, Musk aims to consolidate entertainment and social interaction into a single space, enhancing user experience and keeping them engaged for longer periods.The beta release of X TV, unveiled on September 3, 2024, is currently available to a select group of users, whose feedback will be critical in shaping the platform’s future updates.On September 3, 2024, Musk took to his X account to announce the beta release of X TV:Although not yet available to the general public, the beta version is being tested by early adopters who are actively exploring its functionalities. The app is currently optimised for Android TVs but will soon be integrated with LG, Amazon Fire TV, and Google TV. Musk’s team has hinted at more platform expansions in the future, allowing a wider range of users to experience X TV.The beta phase is essential for collecting user feedback and making improvements before a full-scale launch. Musk has a history of leveraging user insights to fine-tune new features, and X TV is expected to follow this same iterative development model.X TV boasts several innovative features that set it apart from traditional streaming platforms. These features are designed to provide flexibility, control, and an enhanced user experience.One of the standout features is Replay TV, which allows users to store up to 72 hours of shows in the cloud. This feature ensures that users never miss a favourite program, even if they are unable to watch it live. Replay TV provides the freedom to catch up on missed content at any time within the 72-hour window, making it perfect for today’s on-the-go lifestyle.For those who tune in late to a live broadcast, Startover TV offers a game-changing solution. This feature enables viewers to restart any live show from the very beginning, ensuring they don’t miss crucial moments. Whether it's a live sporting event, a news broadcast, or a favourite TV show, Startover TV ensures that viewers can enjoy the full experience, regardless of when they begin watching.One of the most user-friendly features is Free Cloud DVR, which allows users to record up to 100 hours of content at no extra cost. This feature is particularly appealing to those who wish to store a wide range of content, from movies to series, without worrying about additional fees. By offering this feature for free, X TV positions itself as a cost-effective alternative to other streaming services that charge for cloud storage.The launch of X TV represents a significant step in Musk’s vision to turn X from a simple microblogging platform into a comprehensive multimedia hub. While the X app has long been known for its ability to disseminate real-time information and updates, the addition of X TV seeks to broaden its appeal by incorporating a variety of media experiences within the same platform.This integration is not just about expanding content options; it’s about increasing user engagement. By offering movies, live broadcasts, and recorded content, X TV gives users more reasons to stay on the platform, thus reducing the need to switch between multiple apps or services.X TV is also expected to encourage content creators, influencers, and media companies to engage with the X app more fully. The potential for live-streamed events, interactive programming, and user-generated content creates new avenues for growth and user interaction.As the X TV beta continues to roll out, additional features and platform integrations are expected in the near future. These updates may include broader compatibility with Apple TV, Roku, and other streaming devices, further increasing the app’s reach. Musk has also hinted at potential partnerships with media companies, which could lead to exclusive content being available on X TV.Furthermore, there is speculation about possible AI-driven content recommendations that would help personalise the user experience. Given Musk’s interest in AI and its integration across his companies, such a feature could be a logical next step for X TV.Another area to watch is social viewing, where users could watch content together with friends, share reactions in real-time, and discuss events as they unfold. Such features would help X TV maintain its social roots while expanding its media capabilities.","X TV is a new feature within the X app (formerly known as Twitter) It is set to transform the way users consume films, live content, and recorded shows.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

NEW DELHI: Floki , a 3-year-old border collie, has become a sensation on Rio de Janeiro’s beaches by playing footvolley , a mix of soccer and beach volleyball . Crowds stop to watch and record this unique spectacle, where a dog plays a game that even humans find challenging.Footvolley follows beach volleyball rules but with a lower net and no use of hands or arms, similar to soccer.Floki uses his mouth to hit the ball, impressing onlookers with his skill. His owner, Gustavo Rodrigues, a footvolley coach, discovered Floki’s potential early on when the dog began jumping after balloons at just 2 months old.Rodrigues introduced Floki to “altinha,” a game where participants juggle a soccer ball in a circle. Floki transitioned to footvolley last year, a sport popular among retired Brazilian soccer stars like Ronaldinho and Romário. Floki quickly excelled in this demanding game.“He does things that even some professionals don’t — like positioning on the court,” Rodrigues said, explaining how Floki always faces the ball to hit it straight on.Floki’s performances have garnered hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and TikTok. With growing fame, they also participate in marketing events and social media content creation. Floki and Rodrigues often travel from their home in Brasilia to Rio and other locations for appearances.On a recent Sunday, Floki played with former footvolley champion Natalia Guitler. They filmed for social media, and Floki took breaks for water and to cool off. Guitler, with almost 3 million Instagram followers, later posted their rally.Despite a busy schedule, Floki remains focused and energetic. His weekend ended with a marketing shoot for a fashion designer and promoting dog popsicles on Instagram.Rodrigues and Floki’s competitive matches are intense, with opponents determined to avoid losing to a dog. “It generates talk, and people make fun,” Rodrigues said. “No one likes to lose a point to him, so people play their hearts out against us.”Rodrigues and Floki will continue their unique journey, balancing influencer activities with playing competitive matches.","Floki, a 3-year-old border collie, has become a sensation on Rio de Janeiro’s beaches by playing footvolley.

Los Angeles Rams Receiver Puka Nacua Sidelined Due to Knee Injury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/los-angeles-rams-receiver-puka-nacua-sidelined-due-to-knee-injury/articleshow/113191599.cms,"What Happened To Puka Nacua?

Puka Nacua is a star wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams who burst onto the scene in his rookie season with Pro Bowl recognition. He suffered a knee injury on Sunday against the Detroit Lions. Unfortunately, it took him out early in the game, making fans and coaches concerned about the extent of his condition.Puka Nacua hopped off the field, clutching his knee, after an awkward landing while finishing a catch in the second quarter.He immediately went into the blue sideline tent with the medical staff as he hobbled off. He had briefly returned for a couple of plays, but his pain was clear, and he was benched once more. His place on the field was taken by Tyler Johnson. One report had it that ""Nacua was carted off the field to the locker room, a scene captured on the NBC broadcast. He had four receptions for 35 yards at the time of his removal.Nacua's knee problem is not exactly new. He also missed a good chunk of the preseason and even parts of training camp due to a knee problem he had aggravated in a joint practice with the Los Angeles Chargers. Rams head coach Sean McVay had previously mentioned that Nacua had fallen onto a bursa sac in his knee, which accounted for his earlier absence.Picked by the Rams in 2023 with the 77th overall pick, Nacua wasted no time distinguishing himself from the rest of the NFL rookie crop in terms of reception and yard accumulation. His first season brought in 105 receptions for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns, catapulting him into a primary asset with the Rams and one of the main targets for quarterback Matthew Stafford. His rise to prominence had come as a direct result of the absence ofCooper Kupp , who had been the team's WR1 before suffering an injury.With Nacua out once more, this is Kupp's opportunity to return to center stage and take the reins of the Rams' receiving corps. No official diagnosis has been given for the current injury to Nacua, and it has raised concerns about the severity thereof, as non-contact injuries rarely tend to be good. The Rams await further word, but all eyes will now be on Kupp to capitalize on this opportunity with Nacua out.","Puka Nacua is a star wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams who burst onto the scene in his rookie season with Pro Bowl recognition.
