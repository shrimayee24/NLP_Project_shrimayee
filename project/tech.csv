Many players reported problems logging in and using PlayStation Network’s social features during the downtime.Expressing frustration, one user wrote in the comment section of Downdetector: “Is it even worth it?

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined. The future, he says, will favour those who combine technical understanding with creativity, critical thinking, and leadership qualities that remain uniquely human.","Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti outlines four strategies on how employees can succeed in the AI-driven workplace.

How did the accused react?



What role does Trump play here?







A cluster of leaked Telegram messages has revealed a disturbing side of Young Republicans.The chats exposed racist, antisemitic, and violent exchanges among several state-level leaders who frequently invoked Nazi references, racial slurs, and threats to political rivals.The chats were obtained by POLITICO and span more than seven months and involve leaders from Young Republican groups across New York, Kansas, Arizona, and Vermont.Over 2,900 pages of messages were reviewed, containing more than 28,000 posts filled with slurs such as “fa---t,” “re----d,” and “n--ga,” which appeared more than 250 times in total.In the group, named “RESTOREYR WAR ROOM,” members frequently used racial slurs, glorified violence, and joked about Nazi gas chambers.Peter Giunta, then chair of the New York State Young Republicans, was among the most vocal ones, sending messages such as “I love Hitler” and “everyone that votes no is going to the gas chamber.”Another member, Kansas Young Republicans’ vice chair William Hendrix, repeatedly used racial slurs like “n--ga” and “n--guh,” while Bobby Walker, the New York State Young Republicans’ vice chair at the time, referred to rape as “epic.”The chat often made fun of minorities. In one exchange, Giunta dismissed Black athletes by saying, “I’d go to the zoo if I wanted to watch monkey play ball.” He also called Black people “the watermelon people.” In another instance, Hendrix joked about “watermelon and kool aid.”The chat also included a message from Alex Dwyer, Kansas Young Republicans chair, claiming that “Missouri doesn’t like f--s,” and making light of Nazi imagery.The group frequently invoked white supremacist symbols. Dwyer once replied “1488” when asked to guess a hotel room number — a code widely used by neo-Nazis that refers to “14 words” and “Heil Hitler.”After POLITICO began making inquiries, several members faced repercussions. Hendrix was removed from his role in Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach’s office, while another member had a job offer rescinded.Giunta later apologised, saying, “I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language found within the more than 28,000 messages of a private group chat that I created during my campaign to lead the Young Republicans.” He also claimed the chats might have been “deceptively doctored.”Walker, now the chair of the New York State Young Republicans, also issued an apology, saying, “There is no excuse for the language and tone in messages attributed to me. The language is wrong and hurtful, and I sincerely apologise.”The chat’s members often discussed Trump’s influence as the MAGA chief. “Trumps too busy burning the Epstein files,” Dwyer wrote, referencing the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Surprisingly, some members appeared aware of the potential fallout. “If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr,” Walker wrote in one message.Their fears have now come true. The revelations have triggered outrage across the GOP, with calls for resignations and disciplinary action.","Leaked Telegram messages reveal racist, antisemitic, and violent exchanges among several state-level leaders.

Get married online via video call from anywhere: Abu Dhabi launches Dh800 virtual wedding service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/marry-over-video-call-from-anywhere-abu-dhabi-launches-dh800-virtual-wedding-service/articleshow/124577665.cms,"Abu Dhabi launches online wedding service via TAMM app. Image: File

TAMM App’s process for fast, legal online marriages

UAE leads the Gulf with remote weddings





Couples in Abu Dhabi can now get legally married with just a few taps on their phones, thanks to the innovative marriage service launched on the government’s TAMM app - all for Dh800 (approximately $217). The all-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony, marking a new milestone in the emirate’s drive for smart government services.The TAMM app, which consolidates over 1,100 government and private sector services onto a single platform, now offers this seamless marriage solution under the supervision of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department. Through a WebEx video link, the couple, two witnesses, and a licensed officiant join the wedding ceremony virtually. Even guests can participate remotely, eliminating the need for physical presence anywhere in the UAE. For couples residing abroad, a power of attorney can represent them locally during the ceremony.Describing the feature as a matter of convenience, Hammad Alhammadi, executive director of customer care and happiness sector at TAMM, said, “Even if you visit Abu Dhabi, you are able to log into and transact on services through Tamm, and one of them will be the marriage contract,” and added, “It's getting a lot of momentum right now.Maybe [it loses the romance] if you're getting married, but can also be very helpful. ”Couples seeking attested marriage certificates can pay an additional Dh300 for the app to automatically attest the document through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and deliver a secure digital version. Instead of traditional physical stamps, the marriage certificate now carries a UAE Pass digital signature. The entire streamlined process from document submission to ceremony scheduling can be completed within 24 hours if couples book an appointment in advance and have all necessary paperwork.To safeguard legal compliance and prevent underage or forced marriages, the marriage service is integrated with the UAE Pass and Emirates ID systems, verifying applicant identities and eligibility.Mohamed Al Askar, who heads the Abu Dhabi government TAMM application, told AFP at the Dubai-based Gitex Global 2025 tech fair: ""It's open to everyone. Whoever wants to get married in Abu Dhabi, regardless of their nationality, can get the service online. People can go online, they can do the whole transaction without the need to go to any physical place. We are among the first to do that.""The UAE stands out as the only Gulf nation allowing foreigners to enter into non-religious marriages, and this latest initiative reaffirms Abu Dhabi’s leadership in digital public services. Inspired by preliminary online marriage services introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic and modeled on innovations from countries like Ukraine, Abu Dhabi’s digital wedding experience is among the world’s first to facilitate fully remote, cross-border civil marriages.Lauding the transformative nature of TAMM AutoGov, His Excellency Ahmed Tamim Hisham Al Kuttab, Chairman of the Department of Government Enablement - Abu Dhabi, told Timeout: “The launch of TAMM AutoGov is truly transformative, redefining what government means in people’s lives. Here, government is no longer reactive. It’s a partner that is intelligent, human-centered, and present at the moments that matter most. With the world’s first transactional AI public servant, Abu Dhabi is showing the world what anticipatory government looks like.”In essence, Abu Dhabi’s new online marriage service through the TAMM app offers couples a modern, convenient, and legally recognized way to wed quickly—whether they’re residents, citizens, or overseas—with full government backing and digital certification that embraces the future of smart governance.",Abu Dhabi launches online wedding service via TAMM app. All-digital service enables couples anywhere in the world to complete their marriage legally through a secure online ceremony.

UAE: Too good to be true? Sharjah Police warn of ‘dream car’ scams targeting buyers and sellers online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-too-good-to-be-true-sharjah-police-warn-of-dream-car-scams-targeting-buyers-and-sellers-online/articleshow/124573542.cms,"Scammers use professional car photos and ultra-low prices, along with pressure tactics like “many are interested,” to trick buyers into paying deposits before vanishing/ Representative Image

How the scam works: A ""dream car"" that disappears after the deposit

A Tempting Dream – A product that feels out of reach is suddenly available at an irresistible price;



A Symbolic Price – So low it suspends disbelief and encourages rapid action;



Flashy Photos – Professional visuals add legitimacy to the fake listing.





Sellers also targeted: Fake payments and forged documents used to steal vehicles

The real defence: Verification, caution, and critical thinking

For buyers:





View the vehicle in person before making any financial commitment;



Request and inspect ownership documents;



Verify the identity of the seller, including matching ID to vehicle registration;



Be cautious of suspiciously low prices, especially those paired with pressure tactics.





For sellers:





Do not release the vehicle until payment is confirmed and cleared in your bank account;



Treat all payment confirmations and receipts as suspect until verified with your bank;



Be wary of buyers using urgency or false documentation to push early handovers.





For all users:





Sharjah Police encourage anyone who encounters a suspicious listing or request to report it immediately by calling 80040, the designated hotline for such fraud cases.





Authorities take action: Public warnings and swift arrests





In a sharp warning to the public, Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers. The frauds, which prey on emotions and override logical decision-making, have led to significant financial losses across the UAE. As part of their response, Sharjah Police released an official awareness video cautioning residents to verify every step and report suspicious activity without delay.The fraudulent scheme typically begins on popular classified platforms or social media, where visually polished ads present luxury or desirable vehicles at prices far below market value. The low price point is not accidental—it is designed to sidestep skepticism and provoke emotional decisions.Victims report being lured by high-quality car images, quick responses from the ""seller,"" and urgent messaging claiming other buyers are interested. This pressure, often phrased as ""first to pay gets the car,"" manipulates urgency, pushing the buyer to act without verifying the offer.Once a deposit is transferred, communication ceases. Calls and messages go unanswered, and the advertisement vanishes. In nearly all cases, the car is non-existent, and the fraudster is unreachable.According to Sharjah Police, the scam is structured around a pattern of psychological triggers:Police stress that this tactic isn’t random—it’s a deliberate attempt to bypass logic and exploit emotional vulnerability. Victims aren’t just deceived; they’re manipulated into self-convincing belief.In a separate but connected criminal scheme, sellers of vehicles have also become victims. A criminal gang, recently apprehended by Sharjah Police, targeted private sellers through platforms where vehicles are listed for sale.The perpetrators would express interest, make an attractive offer, and follow up with a falsified payment receipt claiming that funds had been transferred and were awaiting deposit. Using forged identification and persuasive communication, the scammers would convince the seller to hand over the car, believing the payment was in progress.In reality, no money was ever transferred, and by the time the scam is uncovered, the vehicle is gone.This variation of the scam highlights how both buyers and sellers are vulnerable in digital transactions—particularly in unregulated online environments where identity and payment verification are minimal or entirely absent.To combat this rising threat, Sharjah Police are calling on the public to remain alert and follow essential verification steps before engaging in any online vehicle transactions.In response to the increasing frequency of these crimes, Sharjah Police have intensified public awareness campaigns, including the release of an official video outlining the key tactics scammers use. These efforts aim to educate the public about how modern frauds rely more on emotional manipulation than obvious deception.A senior police officer explained that many victims “failed to verify and didn’t ask”, emphasizing that excessive trust and lack of due diligence are the two main vulnerabilities exploited.Police have also acted swiftly in high-profile cases. In one instance, a criminal group running an online car scam was arrested within just 12 hours. This shows the authorities’ strong commitment to curbing economic crimes in the digital space.","Sharjah Police have exposed a rising wave of highly orchestrated online vehicle scams targeting both buyers and sellers. The frauds, which prey on emotions and override logical decision-making, have led to significant financial losses across the UAE. Sharjah Police released an official awareness video cautioning residents to verify every step and report suspicious activity without delay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124574645,imgsize-724869,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-online-car-scams.jpg"

Riyadh, get ready to sashay! The city’s biggest fashion week is about to turn up the heat with Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, two style legends are set to headline the event, promising jaw-dropping designs, cultural fusion, and sustainable glamour like never before.Riyadh Fashion Week 2025 is not just another event on the fashion calendar; it's a bold statement. From October 16 to 21, the Saudi capital transforms into a sartorial playground, featuring over 30 runway shows, designer presentations, and citywide activations. This year's edition marks a significant milestone as it welcomes international fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney to the Kingdom's fashion stage for the first time.The style revolution kicks off on October 16 with a show that's pure, electric fusion: the Middle Eastern runway debut of Vivienne Westwood. But this isn't just a transplant of a London catwalk. In a move that brilliantly honors local artistry, the house is collaborating with Art of Heritage by Princess Noura Al Faisal.Imagine: iconic British punk aesthetics, the rebellious cuts, the historical references, the sheer attitude—set against the serene backdrop of a Riyadh palm grove.The collection will feature specially created embroidered gowns, a direct result of mixing Westwood's couture team's expertise with the exquisite craftsmanship of local Saudi artisans. It's a ""global-local"" philosophy brought to life, a powerful cultural exchange that doesn't just showcase fashion, but actively fosters and empowers Saudi heritage and craftsmanship for a global audience. Get ready for a breathtaking blend of anarchy and elegance.Dame Vivienne Isabel Westwood (1941–2022) was not born into high society; she came from a modest working-class family in Tintwistle, Derbyshire, England. Her father worked as a storekeeper and her mother was a skilled weaver. Westwood's achievements are marked by a unique blend of anarchy, historical reference, and fierce activism. She defined the look of punk, introducing anti-establishment imagery, bondage gear, safety pins, and provocative slogans to fashion. After punk was widely co-opted, Westwood turned to history for bold inspiration. Her first official runway collection,(1981), launched the influential ""New Romantic"" movement. Subsequent collections revived historical cuts like the bustle and the mini-crini, cementing her global reputation as an innovator who fused history with contemporary rebellion.Bringing the spectacular week to a thoughtful and luxurious close on October 21 is the regional debut of Stella McCartney. As a pioneer of sustainable luxury, McCartney's presence underscores Saudi Arabia's bold step toward conscious creativity and an eco-friendly future in fashion.Her show will be a curated presentation of her recent and archival collections, a masterclass in fashion that proves you don't need to sacrifice animals or the planet for show-stopping style.

Her debut cements Riyadh Fashion Week as a platform not only for style but for substance, emphasizing the Kingdom's commitment to building a modern fashion ecosystem rooted in ethical and future-facing values.Stella Nina McCartney CBE (born 1971) was born into a world of both celebrity and conscious living. She is the daughter of The Beatles' legendary singer-songwriter Sir Paul McCartney and the late American photographer and devoted animal rights activist, Linda McCartney. McCartney's career is defined by her unwavering commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainable innovation.While the international icons are drawing the global gaze, Riyadh Fashion Week remains fiercely dedicated to shining a brilliant light on the incredible talent thriving within the region. Over 30 runway shows and presentations will celebrate a diverse lineup that spans high couture, contemporary ready-to-wear, and street-smart menswear. Prepare to be wowed by established Saudi brands like the elegant couturiers Tima Abid and Atelier Hekayat, the sustainable chic of Abadia, the modern design of Hindamme, and the experimental streetwear of 1886.

AI takes office: Abu Dhabi unveils world’s first AI-powered public servant at GITEX Global 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ai-takes-office-abu-dhabi-unveils-worlds-first-ai-powered-public-servant-at-gitex-global-2025/articleshow/124556927.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s TAMM AutoGov is world’s first AI public servant / AI-generated illustrative image

TAMM AutoGov: Abu Dhabi unveils the world’s first AI public servant

What TAMM AutoGov will do for citizens

Less paperwork and fewer missed deadlines for residents.

Faster processing of basic services (licences, permits, renewals).

More personalised notifications for example, reminders timed to your preferences.

How it’s built and who’s behind it

Ethics, privacy and the practical checks citizens should watch for

How and where their data is stored and who can access it.

What “automation levels” mean in practice (which actions are fully automatic vs. prompted).

How to correct mistakes if the AI completes a service incorrectly.

Why this is different and what to expect next





Imagine your driving licence renewing itself, or bills getting paid before deadlines that’s what Abu Dhabi’s new AI-powered public servant TAMM AutoGov promises, marking a new era of proactive governance unveiled at GITEX 2025.At GITEX Global 2025, Abu Dhabi rolled out TAMM AutoGov, described by authorities as the world’s first transactional AI public servant a major upgrade to the TAMM super-app that lets government services act proactively on behalf of people. The launch is part of Abu Dhabi’s broader plan to become an “AI-native” government by 2027 and is presented as a move from reactive service delivery to “anticipatory governance. ”TAMM AutoGov is built to reduce routine friction by automating recurring tasks and offering proactive service prompts. Examples given by officials include renewing licenses, managing scheduled payments and completing multi-step transactions with user consent. Users can set personal preferences and choose automation levels — meaning the system could, with permission, complete some services for you before you ask.The aim is to make government touchpoints faster, personalised and less dependent on repeated manual requests.Why this matters in plain terms:Abu Dhabi’s rollout doesn’t stand alone — it’s backed by major industry partners and a bold strategic technology push. The Department of Government Enablement (DGE) is working with global vendors and trusted local partners to embed AI and cloud infrastructure that meet sovereign security needs. Key industry collaborations announced around the same time (including work with NVIDIA and Oracle on sovereign AI infrastructure) point to high-performance computing and resilient cloud platforms powering these services. This powerful combination aims to deliver scalable, secure AI services that handle sensitive public data while running complex models fast enough to enable real-time automation.An AI that acts for you raises immediate questions, consent, data use, transparency and error handling. Officials stress that TAMM will allow users to set automation levels and personal preferences, but citizens should still check:Because the initiative handles transactional public services, independent audits, clear opt-in flows, and human-in-the-loop safeguards will be crucial to trust and legal compliance. Abu Dhabi frames this program as secure and sovereign, but observers and residents should watch the published privacy policies, service-level commitments and any third-party audits.Abu Dhabi isn’t just adding a chatbot, it’s attempting systemic change: move public services from “respond when asked” to “anticipate and act.” If successful, the model could cut friction for routine tasks, improve uptake of entitlements, and reduce backlog in public services. Expect a staged rollout, early pilots for low-risk services, and growing visibility of the technology stack and governance safeguards as it expands. Keep an eye on future announcements about scope, third-party audits and how citizens can control or opt out of automation.","TAMM AutoGov is the world’s first transactional AI public servant.

“Proudly Indian” products you’ll never find in India

Taj Mahal Noodles - “Taste of the Heritage”: Instant noodles with a picture of the Taj Mahal and a promise of “authentic Indian spices.” Tastes suspiciously like chicken ramen with coriander dreams.

Bollywood Pickle - Jar label: a dancing couple, tagline: “Spicy Like Cinema!” It’s mango achar that smells like a film set and tastes like drama.

Royal India Biscuits: Manufactured in Ajman, “imported from India” (questionable), these biscuits come in tins showing tigers and temples. The flavor? Vanilla-ish nostalgia.

Mysore Rose Body Lotion (Made in Oman) : Because nothing says “India” like an Omani lotion that smells like grandma’s wedding perfume.

Desi Detox Drink: Tulsi-Lemon-Chia Fusion, a modern miracle drink that no Indian has ever heard of, but every wellness influencer in Dubai swears is “ayurvedic.”

Indian Frozen foods that defy expectation

.

The Unlikely Suspects: You walk past the frozen Okra (Bhindi) and Drumsticks (because who has time to chop that ?), and then you see them: trays of Frozen Gajar ka Halwa (carrot pudding). Yes. A dessert that takes four hours of slow simmering is now a pop-it-in-the-microwave affair. Who buys this? Everyone.

The Tiffin Box Time Warp: Another unexpected hero is the individually packed, frozen 'Mini-Meals' or thalis . These aren't fancy; they're the food equivalent of a comfort blanket, containing exactly two rotis , a dollop of dal , and a generic vegetable curry. They exist because the alternative is spending your one weekend day cooking seven meals.

The Frozen Samosa Pyramid Scheme: The sheer volume of frozen samosas and kebabs sold in the UAE is a phenomenon in itself. They're sold in colossal, family-sized packs, often manufactured in a nearby country just to keep up with the overwhelming, year-round demand for instant, deep-fried comfort.

The unseen force: Why are people eating this?

The 9-to-5 Compromise: The biggest force is the Relentless Work Schedule. When you're working 9-to-5 (or 9-to-9) in Dubai, convenience trumps authenticity. It’s a choice between a 5-minute frozen thali and ordering another pricey takeaway. The freezer wins.

and ordering another pricey takeaway. The freezer wins. The Nostalgia Shortcut: These products are shortcuts to memory. The texture might be slightly off, but the Masala Magic is still there. These are culinary emotional support animals.

The UAE Logistics Mastermind: This is the ultimate comedy of the UAE market. If someone, somewhere, in the two million-strong Indian community, demands a frozen item, the market will find a way to import it, manufacture it, and stock it even if it's the most time-consuming dessert ever conceived. The demand is so high, it's a guaranteed profit. The market is literally bending to the will of nostalgia.

Weird demands from non-desi shoppers

The ""Mild Curry Powder"" Mission: Foreigners walk in demanding the ""safest, least spicy curry powder."" The staff, who measure chili heat on a scale that goes up to ""Volcanic Eruption,"" will hand them a bag labeled ""Daily Mild Masala,"" which is still spicy enough to activate a smoke alarm. The hilarious reality is that even the mildest option is a culinary challenge, reinforcing the idea that Indian food simply refuses to be truly bland.

The Search for 'The Sauce' : After eating pani puri on the street, tourists often return searching for the ""green liquid that tasted like mint and heaven."" They aren't looking for pudina chutney; they are looking for The Elixir of Life, and they can't quite describe the exact combination of herbs, tamarind, and chili required. The staff often just hand them a generic, slightly sweetened coriander sauce, knowing they'll never quite replicate the street vendor magic.

They often leave with rice intended for gruel or thickening, convinced they've found the secret to affordable Asian cuisine.

The Dettol Dilemma: Non-Desi shoppers are constantly mystified by the huge stock of original, powerful Dettol bottles.

They often buy it out of pure curiosity, wondering why the cleaning aisle smells like a hospital.





Walk into any “Indian grocery” in the UAE, and you’ll instantly feel two things: nostalgia and mild cultural whiplash. The smell of cardamom and detergent hits you, Bollywood songs play from a small Bluetooth speaker, and you spot a pack labelled “Taj Mahal Pasta – Real Indian Taste. ”Wait… pasta? Taj Mahal ? Real Indian taste?Congratulations, you’ve entered the world of UAE’s Desi Grocery Oddities, where nostalgia meets marketing gone rogue, and half the shelves are stocked with items that would make your Indian relatives blink twice and whisper,There’s an entire aisle of “Made for expats” brands that existin the Gulf.

Here are some all-time classics you’ll find stacked neatly beside the Maggi packets:The frozen food aisle isn't just about ready-made butter chicken; it's a silent, brightly-lit gallery of culinary compromises and logistics marvels.

"Dubai to become first city outside US with Elon Musk’s Boring Company Loop system, 17 km phase 1 by 2026",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-to-become-first-city-outside-us-with-elon-musks-boring-company-loop-system-17-km-phase-1-by2026/articleshow/124545152.cms,"Dubai’s 17 km underground Loop by Elon Musk’s Boring Company promises fast, cool, futuristic rides, launch expected in 2026 / Images courtesy of official X posts from @rta_dubai and @boringcompany

What exactly is the Dubai loop?

Builder: The Boring Company (founded by Elon Musk in 2016)

(founded by Elon in 2016) Length (phase 1): ~17 km (10.6 miles)

Stations: ~11, including major commercial and residential hubs

Capacity: 20,000 pph initially

Speed: Up to 160 km/h (100 mph)

Expected opening: 2026

The big reveal: Who announced the Dubai loop and when

What is the Boring Company and Elon Musk’s role in the Dubai loop?

Founder & Visionary: Musk drives the concept, pushing for rapid innovation and testing unconventional transport methods.

Track Record: The company’s first major project, the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, operates a short route using Tesla pods. It serves as a prototype for larger city networks.

Dubai Loop Role: The Boring Company will construct and operate the initial 17 km network, design pods and stations, and integrate technology for safety and speed. Musk’s personal vision shapes ambitious timelines and futuristic features, like high-speed electric pods and minimal surface impact.

Why Dubai wants the loop: Solving heat, traffic, and time





Fast Commutes: Trips that take 30–60 minutes could drop to minutes.

Weather-Proof Transit: Underground tunnels mean no sun, no sand, no sweating.

Zero Emissions: Electric vehicles mean no pollution or noise.

Smart Integration: RTA plans to sync the Loop with Metro, tram, and bus systems for seamless connectivity.

Timeline and progress: How real is the 2026 goal?





Dubai’s daily traffic jams could soon be history. Elon Musk ’s Boring Company is digging deep to build the Dubai Loop, a 17-kilometre underground electric transit system slated for 2026. Announced by UAE’s AI Minister Omar Sultan Al Olama at GITEX 2025, the project aims to whisk commuters across the city in minutes, combining speed, sustainability, and sci-fi flair.Think of the Dubai Loop as a series of underground tunnels where small electric vehicles — Teslas or custom pods zip passengers through tubes at speeds up to 160 km/h (100 mph).Instead of heavy metro trains, these vehicles run continuously, aiming to transport about 20,000 passengers per hour in the first phase. Future expansions could scale that up to 100,000 passengers/hour as more tunnels are added.This system isn’t a metro replacement but a new layer of rapid micro-transit, designed to beat congestion, heat, and long commutes with zero emissions.The story broke when UAE’s Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Sultan Al Olama, revealed that Elon Musk’s The Boring Company is set to open the Dubai Loop in 2026. The announcement came during GITEX 2025, Dubai’s massive annual tech expo, where innovation headlines are the norm but this one stole the show.The minister highlighted that Dubai would be the first international city outside the United States to roll out The Boring Company’s Loop system, following its pilot in Las Vegas.Bloomberg first reported the statement on October 13, 2025, followed by Reuters, The National, and Gulf News confirming details through the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). According to the RTA, the initial route will span around 17 km and include 11 stations, forming the foundation for a wider city network.The Boring Company is a US-based infrastructure and tunnel construction firm founded by Elon Musk in 2016. Its mission is to reduce surface traffic congestion by building underground transportation tunnels for electric vehicles.Musk, known for Tesla and SpaceX, envisioned tunnels as a high-speed, climate-controlled alternative to traditional roads and metros, with smaller vehicles moving continuously instead of waiting for large trains.Key points about the company and Musk’s involvement:In short, Musk is the ideal driver, The Boring Company is the builder, and Dubai provides the bold canvas for the project’s international debut.Dubai’s roads are famously efficient but also famously busy. With rapid population growth, tourism influx, and scorching summers, the city faces three transport challenges: congestion, sustainability, and comfort.The Loop answers all three:It’s also an image play: Dubai wants to cement itself as the global capital of future mobility, joining flying taxis, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven public transport already in trials across the emirates.The official statement from the UAE minister sparked excitement but also skepticism. While The Boring Company has proven technology in Las Vegas’ Convention Center Loop, Dubai’s version is much larger and more complex. Still, the optimism from UAE officials signals strong government backing; a key success factor in Dubai’s mega projects.The Dubai Loop fits neatly into the UAE’s ambitious National Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 and Smart Mobility Vision 2040, aiming to automate 25% of all trips through autonomous or AI-assisted transport. If successful, the Loop could dramatically slash surface congestion, create thousands of jobs in tunneling, AI, and operations, set a bold precedent for other GCC cities, and make Dubai a global living laboratory for next-gen infrastructure. Behind it all is Elon Musk’s Boring Company, the visionary tech firm turning this futuristic concept into reality. Musk’s personal drive and the company’s deep tunneling expertise are central to making Dubai’s bold underground transit dream — what they call “transport at the speed of thought” — a tangible reality.","The Dubai Loop is a 17-kilometre underground electric transit system slated for 2026.

"UAE: Abu Dhabi unveils AI tools for early detection of diabetes, cancer and other chronic diseases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-abu-dhabi-unveils-ai-tools-for-early-detection-of-diabetes-cancer-and-other-chronic-diseases/articleshow/124534304.cms,"A diverse team of UAE healthcare professionals showcases advanced AI and holographic technology in a modern hospital.

AI language models: From 5th-Gen Warfare to Next-Gen Medicare.



Abu Dhabi’s three-pillar healthcare strategy

Malaffi: The next-gen healthcare ecosystem





Abu Dhabi is making significant strides in healthcare innovation with the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at predicting and preventing chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer. The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi (DoH) recently unveiled new AI-powered initiatives at GITEX Global 2025, as part of its vision to help residents live longer, healthier lives.One of the standout projects is the Next-Gen Wellness program, which combines wearable technology, AI-driven health analysis, and physician-led care to detect health risks early and promote personalized wellness plans. This program marks a shift from traditional reactive healthcare to a proactive model, where monitoring and intervention happen continuously. Complementing this is the Smart Healthcare Platform, a cloud-based digital system that facilitates real-time health interventions for better patient outcomes and better system efficiency.These innovations build on the foundation laid by Abu Dhabi’s widely acclaimed AI patient risk profiling system, which is now fully operational across all hospitals and clinics in the emirate and covers the entire population.This tool scrutinizes a person’s health records from birth and assesses the risk of developing 14 different diseases, including diabetes and various cancers. What sets this system apart is its ability to clearly explain the reasons behind risk scores, helping doctors make informed decisions and begin treatment early. Large language models embedded in the system assist physicians by quickly retrieving the most relevant patient information and even support patients through interactive AI-enabled tools available on the Sahatna app.Abu Dhabi’s healthcare transformation is guided by a three-pillar strategy focusing on longevity, best-in-class care, and system resilience. Ibrahim Al Jallaf, Executive Director of Digital Health at DoH Abu Dhabi, emphasized the importance of this approach at GITEX: “In Abu Dhabi we have something we call a patient risk profile. This looks for 14 different diseases, such as the probability of somebody getting diabetes or different types of cancers, and it tells the physician, based on the patient that's right in front of you, what is their probability of getting this disease… it informs the physician, and it also gives the physician more information — what lab tests, what recent visits gave the indication to the AI use case that this person has a medium probability of diabetes. ”He also highlighted the supportive role of AI, stating, “Artificial intelligence is there to support the physician. It's very important that we have explainability in the model... It doesn't act on behalf of the physician - instead, it allows the physician to use their knowledge and understanding.”Earlier efforts in the UAE focused heavily on AI-driven disease detection and risk management. Dubai’s EJADA AI platform, for instance, successfully analyzed millions of health records to identify people at high risk of diabetes, leading to a substantial reduction in treatment costs. Meanwhile, university-led research collaborations have deployed AI to discover new immunotherapy targets for diabetes and cancer by studying genes related to blood vessel cells, opening avenues for faster and more cost-effective treatments.The seamless sharing of data through Malaffi, the emirate’s health information exchange, ensures that medical professionals have access to a patient’s full medical history at every visit, supporting more precise and timely interventions. The emirate is also nurturing a truly collaborative innovation ecosystem, welcoming dynamic partnerships with global tech leaders and research institutes to pilot and scale impactful AI solutions. This strategically positions Abu Dhabi as a leading global testbed for smart healthcare technologies, set to benefit both local communities and broader global populations.The latest AI advancements in Abu Dhabi represent a major leap forward from earlier initiatives, moving beyond basic risk prediction to continuous wellness support and highly personalized treatment. This transformative approach is rapidly transforming healthcare delivery, enhancing physician capabilities, and steadily advancing Abu Dhabi’s mission to improve the health and longevity of its residents through groundbreaking innovation and technology.","The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi recently unveiled new AI-powered initiatives at GITEX Global 2025.

"""Yalla,"" ""Habibi,"" ""Inshallah"" and more: The hilarious Arabic mistakes almost every Indian expat makes in the gulf",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/yalla-habibi-inshallah-and-more-the-hilarious-arabic-mistakes-almost-every-indian-expat-makesinthegulf/articleshow/124526300.cms,"From “yalla” to “habibi,” explore the history, fun uses, and classes to learn Arabic for Indians in the Gulf / Image generated by AI for illustrative purposes only

Arabic words Indians have given their own twist

Yalla: While it means ""let's go"" in Arabic, in the Gulf-Indian context, it’s often used to urge someone to hurry up or get moving. For instance, ""Yalla, we’re going to be late!""

Habibi/Habibti: Translating to ""my dear"" or ""my beloved,"" this term is used affectionately among friends and family. ""Habibi, how are you today?""

Inshallah: Meaning ""God willing,"" it's used to express hope for the future. ""Inshallah, we will meet tomorrow.""

Mashallah: Used to express appreciation or admiration, often in response to something good. ""Mashallah, you’ve done a great job!""

Khalas: This means ""enough"" or ""finished."" It's commonly used to indicate that something is done or to stop an action. ""Khalas, I’ve had enough.""

Quick tip: Don't accidentally call your boss a dog!

The Word You WANT to Say What Indians Often Say Why It Can Cause Trouble The Quick Fix! Qalb (Heart) Kalb (Sounds like 'K'ite) In Arabic, your Qalb (with a deep, guttural 'Q') is your heart. But if you say it with a soft 'K,' you've just said Kalb—which means Dog! Say the 'Q' from the very back of your throat. Think of it as a deep, rough 'K'. Khubz (Bread) Kubz (Skipping the 'kh') Khubz is the delicious local flatbread. If you drop the throat sound ('kh'), native speakers might not understand you. The 'kh' sound is like gently clearing your throat. Practice saying 'Kha-liji' (for the Gulf) to get the sound right! Ḥāl (Condition/State) Haal (Too much breath) You use this word for the universal greeting: Kayfa Ḥalak? (How are you?). The Arabic Ḥā’ (ح) is a soft, compressed 'h' sound. Keep your 'h' quiet and smooth. It's not a big, loud English 'H.' Marḥaba (Hello) Mar-HAA-baaa! (Too stressed) We tend to over-emphasize the middle or end of words. Marhaba is a smooth, flowing word. Don't shout! Say it smoothly and evenly. Keep the rhythm flat and friendly, not dramatic.

How trade, culture, and Islam shaped Arabic words in India

From Hal to Waqt: The twin words that bind the dialects

Crossover Word (Hindi/Urdu) Arabic Origin Meaning How it Influences the GCC Dialect Waqt (वक़्त) Waqt (وقت) Time When an Indian asks, ""Kitna waqt?"" (How much time?), an Arab often understands the concept instantly, even if the phrasing isn't Modern Standard Arabic. It’s a shared time-teller. Hal (हाल) Hāl (حال) Condition/State Both languages use this word to ask about well-being. The classic Arabic greeting Kayfa Halak? (How are you?) sounds familiar because of the Hindi/Urdu word for 'condition'. Sahi (सही) Sahīh (صحيح) Correct/Right A simple, powerful affirmative. When an Indian says, ""Sahi baat"" (Correct point), the word itself is instantly recognized by an Arab speaker as meaning ""true"" or ""right."" Qalam (क़लम) Qalam (قلم) Pen Whether you're in a Dubai office or a Mumbai school, the object used for writing is often called qalam. This shared administrative vocabulary is a direct historical link. Amir (अमीर) Amīr (أمير) Rich/Wealthy (or Prince) In Arabic, it means ""prince"" or ""commander."" In Hindi/Urdu, it evolved to mean ""rich."" The shared root confirms a concept of power and status familiar to both cultures.





When you live and work in the Gulf, a few Arabic words sneak into your vocabulary even if you don’t speak Arabic fluently. Words like yalla, inshallah, habibi, khalas and mashallah turn up in shops, on construction sites, in offices and family chats. These words are so common that they become part of everyday speech for many Indians living in the GCC.Let's explore some Arabic words that have become an integral part of the daily conversations of Indians in the Gulf:These words not only enrich the language but also reflect the deep cultural integration between Arabs and Indians in the Gulf.If you're an Indian expat, you've probably nailed the everyday Arabic phrases. But sometimes, those deep Arabic sounds don't exist in Hindi, and our desi pronunciation can land us in hilarious, or awkward, trouble.Here are a few quick tips to save you from mixing up your greetings, your heart, and the nearest canine:The linguistic connection between India and the Arab world stretches back over a millennium, shaped by centuries of trade, cultural exchange, and religious interaction. Arab traders frequented India’s coastal regions, especially Kerala, Gujarat, and the Konkan coast, drawn by spices, textiles, and other valuable goods.Over time, these interactions introduced Arabic vocabulary into Indian languages, while the establishment of communities like the Mappilas in Kerala reflected deeper cultural and linguistic blending. The spread of Islam further cemented Arabic’s influence, as it became the liturgical language and contributed words and expressions to Hindi, Urdu, Malayalam, and Gujarati.In the modern era, particularly after the 1970s Gulf oil boom, large-scale migration of Indian workers to countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman strengthened these linguistic ties. Daily life in the Gulf exposed Indians to Arabic phrases, which gradually merged with their native languages. Today, words like “yalla” (let’s go), “habibi” (my dear), and “inshallah” (God willing) are part of everyday conversations, reflecting centuries of cultural interaction and the ongoing evolution of language in a shared, multicultural space.The most mind-boggling part of the Arabic-Indian linguistic crossover isn't the phrases learned in the Gulf, but the common words that Indians have unknowingly carried from the subcontinent. These ""twin words"" sound almost identical in Hindi/Urdu and Arabic, effortlessly bridging the communication gap and showing how deep the roots of their shared vocabulary go.This linguistic comfort zone means Indian expats often don't need a translator for core concepts, as these words have been an integral part of Indian languages for centuries, mainly filtered through Persian.When in doubt, remember that the Arabic language uses the back of the throat far more than Hindi. A little guttural effort can sometimes save your heart from accidentally becoming a dog! The linguistic and cultural ties between India and the Arab world are both profound and multifaceted. From ancient trade routes to ongoing modern migration, these deep-rooted connections have continually enriched both cultures. For Indians in the Gulf, casually incorporating Arabic words into daily conversations is a testament to this enduring relationship. Fully embracing the Arabic language can further enhance these connections, fostering greater understanding and appreciation of the shared history and culture.","From “yalla” to “habibi,” explore the history, fun uses, and classes to learn Arabic for Indians in the Gulf. In Arabic, your Qalb (with a deep, guttural 'Q') is your heart. Practice saying 'Kha-liji' (for the Gulf) to get the sound right!","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124526617,imgsize-1323080,width-400,resizemode-4/arabic.jpg"

It was meant to be a celebratory day for Eric Trump, but it turned into an awkward moment on social media.US President Donald Trump proudly announced the release of his son’s new memoir, ""Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,"" on Truth Social, urging his followers to “get a copy” of what he called a “phenomenal book. ” He wrote, “Don’t forget to get a copy of my son Eric’s book, ‘UNDER SIEGE,’ which is breaking records everywhere. It’s a phenomenal book, that’s a must read for everyone—Congratulations Eric, you deserve it!!!”However, while the POTUS promoted the memoir online, his son’s in-person book signing told a different story. Eric posted a video from a bookstore in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, inviting people to pick up signed copies of his book. “Bunch of signed books here, first come first serve,” he said. “Come over to Barnes and Noble, Palm Beach Gardens, a bunch of signed books.”Social media users were quick to notice that the store appeared empty.Netizens started mocking the turnout, with one user commenting, “Looks empty,” and another saying, “No one has been waiting for you.” One quipped, “You couldn’t write a postcard, buddy,” while another added, “Your family had Gaza under siege and now you have our rights and freedoms under siege. That what this is about?”Eric Trump’s book retails for $22 and claims to offer “an unfiltered look at the highs and lows of life in the Trump world,” featuring stories from the campaign trail, The Celebrity Apprentice boardroom, and the Trump Organization.It also includes a foreword written by his father.However, Under Siege climbed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller chart on Tuesday, sharing the spotlight with 107 Days, a memoir by former US vice president Kamala Harris.Earlier in the month, Eric had faced backlash during his press tour when he appeared to promote the book while paying tribute to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.","US President Donald Trump announced the release of his son's new memoir, ""Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation,"" on Truth Social.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Global impact, swift recovery







Alphabet-owned YouTube has resolved a brief but widespread outage which disrupted the streaming services for thousands of users around the globe. According to Downdetector, the service outage started on Wednesday evening (October 15) and affected YouTube’s main platform as well as YouTube Music and YouTube TV. As per the outage tracking website, more than 3,66,000 users in the US reported issues accessing YouTube. Similar disruptions were logged in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, with users experiencing playback errors, app crashes, and login issues.YouTube acknowledged the service outage and also shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), ““We’ve resolved the issue impacting video playback. Thanks for your patience.”However, the company did not disclose the root cause of the outage, leaving users and analysts speculating whether it was due to a technical glitch, server overload, or a broader infrastructure hiccup.The YouTube outage started at around 7:55 PM ET and it lasted for several hours. While YouTube has faced occasional disruptions in the past, the scale of this incident—affecting multiple platforms and regions simultaneously—was notable.

China is planning to ban 'design feature' that has been the 'hallmark' of Tesla cars since many years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-is-planning-to-ban-design-feature-that-has-been-the-hallmark-of-tesla-cars-since-many-years/articleshow/124588339.cms,"Xiaomi SUV crash raised fears





China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly unveiled a draft national standard that could spell the end for hidden door handles, a popular feature in new energy vehicles (NEVs) and some gasoline models, citing safety concerns. According to a report in South China Post, the proposed regulation, released this week, mandates that all passenger car doors, except tailgates, must have exterior handles with a minimum hand-operable space of 60mm x 20mm x 25mm and a mechanical release function.The proposal, if implemented, will effectively ban fully flush, electronically actuated door handles — a design Tesla helped popularize and that has since become a hallmark of NEVs. These handles sit flush with the body and extend only when activated. They were designed to cut air drag to extend NEVs' mileage and also give cars a futuristic look.The move aims to enhance vehicle safety, improve passive safety technologies, and protect lives, the ministry stated. Hidden door handles have raised concerns about emergency access. Reports, including an incident involving a Xiaomi SU7, highlight difficulties rescuers face in opening doors during accidents, particularly if sensors fail or power is lost.“Hidden handles can jam in collisions or fires, complicating rescues,” an engineer from a domestic carmaker told National Business Daily. Great Wall Motor Chairman Wei Jianjun has also criticized the design’s reliability. Public data shows about 60% of China’s top 100 NEVs in April featured these handles, seen in models like the Nio ES8, Li Auto i8, Xiaomi YU7, and XPeng P7.The draft requires doors to be openable without tools, even if the vehicle’s locking system or battery fails. While hidden handles improve range by 5-10 kilometers, according to an Aion engineer, their futuristic appeal may not outweigh safety risks. Some buyers, particularly older consumers, prefer conventional handles, dealers note.Automakers are bracing for costly redesigns but are ready to comply. Toyota is developing mechanical backups for hidden handles, while Geely, involved in drafting the standard, and Leapmotor have pledged adherence. The proposal includes a transition period: new models must comply within seven months of adoption, and existing models within 19 months.The Chinese ministry is seeking public feedback before finalizing the rule, which analysts say balances urgent safety needs with automakers’ development timelines. If implemented, the standard could reshape vehicle design in China’s booming NEV market, prioritizing safety over style.","China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly unveiled a draft national standard that could spell the end for hidden door handles.

"ChatGPT to soon generate erotica content for verified users, as OpenAI’s ‘treat adults like adults’ policy goes live",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-to-soon-generate-erotica-content-for-verified-users-as-openais-treat-adults-like-adults-policy-goes-live/articleshow/124583634.cms,"ChatGPT’s new erotica feature for verified users

Public reactions and implications





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced that from December 2025, ChatGPT will allow verified adult users to access and generate erotica content. The change comes under a new “treat adults like adults” policy and marks a shift from previous restrictions, which focused on mental health safeguards but limited the chatbot’s usability and experience for many users. With improved safety tools and mitigation strategies, OpenAI plans to relax restrictions for adults while continuing to block harmful, illegal, or exploitative content. Verified adults will also have more control over ChatGPT’s tone, style, and personality, creating what the company claims will be a more personalised and engaging experience.According to OpenAI, verified adult users will now be able to generate erotica and other mature content safely. The company emphasises that age verification is mandatory to ensure only users over 18 can access these features. Robust age-gating measures will combine verification methods with behaviour-based checks, which may analyse interaction patterns to confirm adult status. This approach, OpenAI says, is designed to prevent minors from accessing sensitive content while allowing adults to explore creative and sexual material responsibly.OpenAI stated that in addition to erotica, verified users will be able to customise ChatGPT’s personality and conversation style. Options include more human-like responses, friendly interactions, and emoji-rich chats. Explicit adult modes will only activate if users specifically request them, giving adults complete control over the content they encounter.The announcement has generated mixed responses. Many adult users have welcomed the opportunity to access erotica and enjoy a more personalised ChatGPT experience. Others, however, have raised concerns about potential misuse and the importance of keeping safeguards effective. OpenAI maintains that this update aims to balance user creativity, freedom, and safety, aligning with what it describes as responsible and mature digital content standards.However, some critics have voiced significant concerns about the effectiveness of age verification measures, fearing that minors might still gain access to adult content despite protections. Ethical questions have been raised about the normalisation of AI-generated erotica and its potential impact on vulnerable users and broader societal norms. There are also doubts about whether safety mechanisms can fully prevent the creation or distribution of harmful, exploitative, or non-consensual material.Mental health experts have cautioned that exposure to erotic content could trigger psychological distress or addictive behaviours in certain individuals. Meanwhile, legal and regulatory scrutiny is intensifying, with growing calls for stricter oversight of AI platforms that produce adult content.Critics further argue that the introduction of erotica could prioritise commercial interests over responsible AI use, with concerns about unpredictable chatbot behaviour linked to content personalisation. High-profile figures such as billionaire Mark Cuban and politician Vivek Ramaswamy have issued warnings about potential risks to minors, social isolation, and increased addiction, urging a cautious approach and stronger safeguards. This complex mix of enthusiasm and apprehension highlights the challenge OpenAI faces in balancing creative freedom with user safety and ethical responsibility.As OpenAI moves forward with this bold update, its ability to maintain trust while managing moral and regulatory scrutiny will define how society views AI’s role in adult digital spaces.","ChatGPT will allow verified adult users to access and generate erotica content.

American software giant Atlassian CEO says company is hiring more new engineers this year compared to previous years because…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-software-giant-atlassian-ceo-says-company-is-hiring-more-new-engineers-this-year-compared-to-previous-years-because/articleshow/124580847.cms,"Growing tech demands drive need for more human engineers

Vibe coding complements rather than replaces core engineers





Atlassian is bucking the trend of tech industry uncertainty by ramping up its engineering workforce, with CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes revealing the company is hiring more new graduates in 2025 than in the previous two years combined. Speaking on the ""20VC"" podcast this week, Cannon-Brookes projected that his company will employ more engineers five years from now than it does today, despite the efficiency gains from AI-assisted coding tools. The Australian-American software giant, best known for its project management platform Jira, currently employs 13,813 full-time workers—a 14% increase from last year.The CEO's optimism stems from his belief that technology creation isn't output-bound. As more and better technology gets developed, demand for software developers will continue growing, he explained. Cannon-Brookes emphasised that while engineers will become more efficient with AI tools, people will keep generating new ideas requiring human expertise to build.""Maybe crap ideas, maybe good ideas,"" he said. ""I like to be an optimist and think we will end up with far more technology, firstly, and secondly, far better technology.”The hiring push targets Atlassian's research, development, and engineering teams specifically. Cannon-Brookes sees fresh graduates bringing valuable new perspectives on software development that could positively disrupt existing talent approaches.The Atlassian chief joins other tech leaders downplaying fears that AI-assisted ""vibe coding"" will eliminate engineering positions. He argued that finance or marketing professionals using these tools to build simple applications doesn't reduce work for core technologists.This stance aligns with recent comments from Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai , who both characterise AI as an accelerator rather than a replacement for human workers. Pichai noted Google saw 10% productivity gains from AI while still planning to expand engineering headcount.Atlassian, founded by Cannon-Brookes in 2002, did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment on its hiring plans.","Atlassian is hiring more engineers in 2025 than in the previous two years combined.

“We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.

Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.

In a few weeks, we plan to put out a new version of ChatGPT that allows people to have a personality that behaves more like what people liked about 4o (we hope it will be better!). If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it (but only if you want it, not because we are usage-maxxing).

In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our “treat adult users like adults” principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”

Cuban’s concern: Trust and safety

“This is going to backfire.Hard.No parent is going to trust that their kids can’t get through your age gating.They will just push their kids to every other LLM.

Why take the risk ?

Same for schools.Why take the risk ? A few seniors in HS are 18 and decide it would be fun to show the hard core erotica they created to the 14 yr olds.

What could go wrong ?”





Billionaire entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now criticised OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the company’s decision to relax safety restrictions in ChatGPT which also includes the permission to generate adult-oriented content verified users. Cuban has now warned that this move by the company could alienate families and also damage the trust in the platform. “This is going to backfire,” Cuban posted on X. “No parent is going to want their kids using ChatGPT if they think erotica is part of the experience.”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has earlier announced that the ChatGPT creatorwill soon release a new version of ChatGPT with fewer guardrails and more personality flexibility, saying the chatbot had been “pretty restrictive” to protect mental health but was now ready to “safely relax the restrictions in most cases.” “We want ChatGPT to feel more alive, more human,” Altman wrote. “That includes allowing verified users to explore adult themes responsibly. ”In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Altman wrote,Responding to this new change, Cuban also shared a post on X and wrote,Cuban’s response reflects growing concern among parents, educators, and tech leaders about the implications of introducing erotica—even in limited, verified contexts—into a widely used AI platform.
