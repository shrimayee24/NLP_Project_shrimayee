How to start the Nerd Challenge in BitLife?



Note:

Pro tip:

Join Nerd clubs to get the character’s focus on Science



Note:

After BitLife’s scandalous Bad Teacher Challenge from last week, the game has now introduced the Nerd Challenge. It demands players to embrace their specs and science while they plan their strategic career. Success here is hinged on balancing academic interests, making strategic choices and having a passion for coding and science. There are a total of five steps to complete the challenge and earn the reward.Here is all you need to know about how to complete Nerd Challenge in BitLife.Success in the new BitLife Nerd Challenge remains hinged on making some precise life choices, right from the beginning. The first and non-negotiable Nerd Challenge steps is to ensure that your character is born in Texas, Austin. The gender of the character is not important. So, choose either.You can even choose Houston or Dallas.As part of the next step, your character needs to wear glasses. You can get it early, possibly by visiting the Activities tab. Once the step is completed, focus on the character’s school and college years. As better grades are needed for later career choices, make sure to focus on them. But this doesn’t mean the character must not focus on extra curricular activities in BitLife.As you age, your character’s parents would show concern over eyesight. So, go ahead and request an eye exam. Then, get the glasses by failing your eye test.Stats do not matter here, but higher smarts would make tasks easy later on.With the option being available, make the character join the Science Club in BitLife during school days, from the Activities tab. It demonstrates the character's budding interest in science. Next, join the Dungeons & Dragons Club from the activity list of the school. It will fulfill the fourth critical step of this challenge.The Science club appears with the DNA symbol. If you do not find it (or Dungeons & Dragons Club), recheck the Activities tab..While both the above choices would reinforce the nerd’s persona, which is needed for the challenge, make sure to keep grades high. Avoid distractions and be on track, as the last step of this challenge demands your character to pursue Computer Science career in BitLife or any related field. Good grades in BitLife will help you secure a job in a highly competitive field.Once you graduate from school, focus on graduating as a Computer Engineer in BitLife. Once you have the degree, it is time to apply for the role of Computer Engineer. If you do not find it, restart the app and refresh the list. It is the last step within the challenge. Completing it will complete the challenge, rewarding you with the BitLife Cutesy Bow Cloche Hat ""It"" Girl Indigo. It will be your digital trophy for the nerdy triumph.","Nerd Challenge in BitLife demands players to embrace their specs and science while they plan their strategic career.

AI in product experience and customer support: Benefits and cautions



Role of AI in creativity and coding: assisting, not replacing humans



Sridhar Vembu’s balanced AI: Experiment, enhance, and ensure human oversight



Also Read |

Sridhar Vembu , the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation , has provided valuable insights into the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern workplaces and business processes. He acknowledges AI’s immense potential to accelerate learning, streamline workflows, and enhance overall product and service experiences, making operations more efficient and data-driven. However, Vembu cautions that over-reliance on AI, misuse, or unmonitored implementation can reduce, or even reverse, the expected productivity gains, creating unforeseen challenges.His perspective underscores the critical importance of responsible AI adoption , emphasising human oversight, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation of AI systems. By balancing technology with careful management, businesses can harness AI’s advantages while mitigating risks and ensuring sustainable growth.Vembu revealed his personal AI habits in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2025, describing himself as a “moderate to heavy” user.A unique approach he follows is having multiple AI systems debate and critique each other’s outputs, which he believes enhances understanding and critical thinking.Vembu highlighted that AI can significantly enhance product experiences and improve customer service efficiency:Tools like Grok in X show how AI can streamline user interaction and provide quicker solutions.AI can support customer service agents, enabling faster responses and more efficient handling of queries.However, he warns against allowing AI to fully replace human agents. Passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure is unethical and risks damaging trust.Vembu emphasised that AI should assist rather than replace human creativity:He advises against using AI to create original content independently.Copying and pasting AI-generated responses without human review or disclosure is considered unprofessional.AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not a substitute for critical thinking, creativity, or decision-making.Vembu also discussed AI in software development, pointing out potential risks and limitations:AI-generated code must undergo comprehensive compliance, privacy, and security reviews. Skipping these processes can undermine software quality, compromise security, and violate professional standards.In some instances, these verification steps may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage, and improper use could even slow development.Zoho programmers are encouraged to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a complete replacement for human coding judgement.Vembu’s philosophy focuses on moderation, experimentation, and evaluation:Use AI to enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving, not as a full substitute for human expertise.Conduct experiments, gather real-world data, and refine AI practices based on outcomes.Ensure human oversight and ethical responsibility in all AI-driven processes.This approach ensures AI serves as a complement to human skill, fostering innovation while maintaining accountability.","Sridhar Vembu is the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation.

A British Airways pilot was reportedly suspended after he left the aircraft’s cockpit door open while operating a Heathrow (LHR) to New York, John F. Kennedy (JFK) flight, reported the Sun.The pilot allegedly wanted his family, who were travelling as passengers, to watch him at the controls, an incident that alarmed some travellers and led crew members to file a report with the airline.As a result, the return flight BA174, scheduled to arrive in London last Friday, was cancelled, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of passengers aboard the twin-engine Boeing 777-300.Since the September 2001 9/11 attacks, when terrorists hijacked US passenger planes and crashed them into skyscrapers in New York City, security measures have tightened, requiring pilots to keep cockpit doors locked. This is done to prevent unauthorised access.“Crew and passengers immediately noticed the cockpit door was open and wanted to know what was happening. It made passengers incredibly uneasy,” a source was quoted as saying by the Sun.“The door was wide open for a significant time, enough for people to worry and comment,” the source said, adding that ""BA colleagues were so alarmed that the pilot was reported in the US and bosses had to suspend him.”Sources at British Airways stated that the pilot’s suspension was consistent with company policy.After a formal investigation, the airline determined there was no security risk, and the pilot has since resumed active duty, as per Aviation A2Z.A British Airways spokesperson emphasised that safety and security are the airline’s top priorities and that all such claims are thoroughly examined.","Pilot allegedly wanted his family, who were travelling as passengers, to watch him at the controls.

UAEU and IIT Madras Zanzibar create AI system to track and forecast malaria outbreaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uaeu-and-iit-madras-zanzibar-create-ai-system-to-track-and-forecast-malaria-outbreaks/articleshow/123332937.cms,"Image: File





A new approach to malaria modelling

Scientific Reports

“Analysis of a Mathematical Model for Malaria Using a Data-Driven Approach”

Technologies at the core: AI and dynamic systems

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)



Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)



Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)





Implications for global health

This research demonstrates the power of AI when combined with classical epidemiological models,” said Prof. Abdessamad Tridane of UAEU. “By embedding environmental dependencies directly into the transmission functions, our model captures the complex, real-world behaviour of malaria spread, providing a more accurate and timely method for disease tracking.”

Institutional collaboration and background

United Arab Emirates University (UAEU), established in 1976 in Al Ain, is the UAE’s oldest public research university. Founded by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, it offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs across multiple disciplines.





IIT Madras Zanzibar Campus, inaugurated in November 2023, is the first international campus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Located in the Bweleo district of Zanzibar, Tanzania, the campus currently offers programs in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It aims to cater to a diverse student population from India, Tanzania, and other African nations, with plans to broaden its academic scope in the coming years.





In a significant step forward for global public health, researchers from United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras’ Zanzibar campus have introduced a cutting-edge, data-driven framework that accurately models and forecasts malaria transmission. By integrating artificial intelligence with mathematical modelling, this new approach aims to support early intervention and improve disease control strategies in malaria-prone regions.A collaborative research team led by Adithya Rajnarayanan, Manoj Kumar, and Professor Abdessamad Tridane has introduced a novel methodology that enhances how malaria outbreaks can be forecasted. Their work, published inby Nature, presents a comprehensive model that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with classical epidemiological frameworks to simulate malaria dynamics with higher precision.The study, titled, brings a fresh perspective to disease modelling. It incorporates temperature- and altitude-dependent variables into compartmental disease models, a method that makes the simulations more realistic and region-specific. This is particularly crucial for climate-sensitive and vulnerable areas where environmental factors heavily influence malaria transmission patterns.To boost the predictive capability of their model, the researchers employed a suite of advanced AI tools. These included:Each of these tools was used to improve the accuracy of disease forecasting, enabling the model to detect patterns in the complex interplay between environmental conditions and malaria spread.Additionally, the study introduced Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a mathematical technique that helps break down complex systems into simpler, understandable components. This was used to create a real-time infection risk metric, offering public health officials a powerful resource for early detection and targeted response.Professor Abdessamad Tridane of UAEU emphasized the importance of this integration of AI with epidemiological modelling, stating:The implications of this research are especially relevant for regions like sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 94% of global malaria cases. With over half a million malaria-related deaths each year, the need for accurate forecasting models is critical. This work offers a valuable step towards improved surveillance, early warning systems, and data-driven policymaking in the fight against malaria.This study represents a collaboration between two institutions that are expanding their global health research footprint:","Researchers from United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras’ Zanzibar campus have introduced a cutting-edge, data- driven framework that accurately models and forecasts malaria transmission.

Ajman’s ban, what it covers







Violations leading to the crackdown





Riding without helmets or safety gear

Entering roads through exits

Riding against traffic on one-way streets

Using pedestrian crossings improperly

Weaving through traffic in an unsafe manner



A broader UAE concern





What riders should know now





Electric scooters are not permitted on any public road or street in Ajman.

The ban includes all types — private, shared, or rental.

Riders are urged to follow official channels for updates on where these vehicles may be used in future.

Compliance is mandatory, and violations may result in vehicle confiscation or fines.





In a decisive move to curb traffic violations and ensure public safety, Ajman has enforced a complete ban on the use of electric scooters on public roads. This follows repeated violations and growing concerns over unsafe riding practices observed across the UAE.Ajman Police has officially prohibited the use of all types of electric scooters — both privately owned and rented — on all public roads and streets within the emirate. The decision, which is effective immediately, is aimed at addressing the increasing number of traffic violations and potential hazards involving e-scooter riders.The police emphasized that the measure is not just regulatory but a public safety initiative, urging residents to avoid riding in unauthorised areas. Riders found violating the ban may face fines or have their vehicles confiscated, although specific penalties have not yet been disclosed.This step comes shortly after Ajman Police issued a public advisory in the previous month, warning riders to comply with road safety regulations and avoid using unauthorised electric bicycles and scooters.The ban follows the release of video footage that captured a number of dangerous and illegal riding behaviours, prompting swift action by authorities. Among the most common violations:These actions not only endanger the riders themselves but also pose serious risks to pedestrians and motorists.Ajman Police highlighted that such reckless conduct is incompatible with safe road usage and undermines efforts to maintain order on the streets.Ajman’s move is part of a wider UAE-wide effort to rein in unsafe e-scooter practices. Across the country, police and transport authorities have repeatedly called on users of two-wheelers to adhere to safety guidelines and restrict usage to designated zones.In Abu Dhabi, a video recently released by the police showed three men in Kanduras riding e-scooters in unsafe, unauthorised areas, drawing public attention and fueling calls for stricter enforcement and better regulations.Similarly, in Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) and Dubai Police have launched a special unit focused on monitoring e-scooter and bicycle violations. The joint effort aims to improve compliance, reduce accidents, and make the streets safer for all.With Ajman’s full ban in place, residents and visitors should be aware of the following:Authorities across the UAE continue to stress the importance of responsible riding and adherence to safety laws, as part of a broader initiative to prevent accidents and ensure road discipline.","Ajman Police has banned the use of all electric scooters on all public roads and streets within the emirate.

When an emergency declaration is made, it is often a precautionary measure to ensure that any potential issue can be addressed on the ground, where engineers have full access to the aircraft. British Airways has not yet confirmed the exact reason for the emergency, and a detailed inspection will be carried out before the plane is returned to service.Flight BA198 departed Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport slightly behind schedule on August 11, 2025, bound for London Heathrow. The long-haul route typically takes around nine hours, passing over the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, and Persian Gulf before entering European airspace.While cruising near Dubai over the Persian Gulf, the cockpit crew declared an emergency by broadcasting transponder code 7700, a universal signal for an in-flight emergency. Air traffic controllers immediately cleared airspace and coordinated the diversion.The aircraft diverted to Hamad International Airport (DOH) in Doha, Qatar, where it landed safely at approximately 14:00 local time. Emergency ground crews were on standby.After arrival in Doha, the Airbus remained on the ground for about four hours while technical checks were carried out. The nature of the problem, whether mechanical, technical, or health-related, was not disclosed by British Airways. Once cleared, BA198 departed Doha and continued onward to London Heathrow, arriving several hours later than scheduled, at around 22:30 BST.Squawk 7700 is used by pilots to indicate any serious in-flight emergency that requires immediate assistance or priority from air traffic control. Once activated, the transponder alert is visible to control centres and nearby aircraft, triggering safety measures such as route clearance, emergency service standby, and expedited landing proceduresAll aircraft are equipped with transponders that broadcast a four-digit squawk code assigned by controllers. Generally, three codes are universally reserved for emergencies: 7500 for a hijacking, 7600 for a communications failure, and 7700 for a general emergency. Pilots may use 7700 in several situations, including engine problems, medical emergencies, fire onboard, and loss of cabin pressure.When a 7700 code is transmitted, controllers can clear airspace, prioritize the approach, and have emergency services on standby. While it does not necessarily mean the aircraft is in imminent danger, it signals that the crew is managing a situation requiring immediate attention.The safe diversion of British Airways flight BA198 to Doha reinforces the aviation industry’s strong safety-first culture and procedural readiness. While the cause of the emergency remains undisclosed, the coordinated actions of the flight crew, air traffic controllers, and ground teams ensured the wellbeing of all onboard. For passengers, the incident was a reminder of the meticulous safety mechanisms and international teamwork that help keep long-haul flights secure, even in unexpected situations.","BA198 from Mumbai to London issued a 7700 emergency signal while cruising near Dubai over the Persian Gulf. Airbus A350-1000 landed safely at Hamad International Airport, where it remained for around four hours before resuming its journey.

Enforcement trends







Government and authority messages:





The United Arab Emirates has recently intensified its enforcement of laws against negative, abusive, and defamatory comments on social media platforms, signaling a strict legal environment for online speech. Authorities across the UAE, including police in Sharjah and Dubai, have issued stern warnings that not only posts but even comments or replies, whether written, audio, video, or live can lead to criminal charges, imprisonment, and hefty fines under the country’s cybercrime and defamation laws.Under Federal Decree Law No. 34 of 2021, amended in 2024, online insults, defamation, and spreading of false or misleading information are criminal offenses. These laws protect individuals, businesses, and public officials from reputational harm caused by defamatory digital content. Authorities emphasize that users often underestimate that even short comment replies or live session remarks are recorded, traceable, and prosecutable.In recent years, the UAE has witnessed a growing number of enforcement actions against individuals who post negative reviews, comments, or defamatory content on social media.Several high-profile cases illustrate the seriousness of these laws in practice. In one instance, a woman was fined after posting a viral Instagram video criticizing a hospital. In another, a man was ordered to pay AED 70,000 in damages for defamatory remarks that harmed a business’s reputation. Legal experts warn that even emotional outbursts or venting personal grievances online can have legal repercussions, as the country’s cybercrime and defamation laws cover a wide range of digital expressions.Authorities have consistently urged residents and visitors to exercise caution in their online behaviour by avoiding personal attacks, abusive language, or insulting remarks, and to instead use official reporting channels when raising complaints. Senior law enforcement officials emphasize that all forms of digital communication, from written posts to comments, replies, live streams, and even private messages are monitored and recorded. Users are reminded to uphold values of respect, tolerance, and coexistence in line with the UAE’s cultural and social norms. The UAE’s National Media Office has further stressed that every social media user acts as an ambassador for the country’s reputation, carrying a responsibility to engage respectfully online. Under existing media regulations, breaches can result in severe administrative measures, including fines of up to AED 1 million or, in the case of media outlets, the closure of the establishment for violations.The UAE’s updated and strictly enforced cybercrime and defamation laws create a robust environment where online negative comments or defamatory remarks are treated as serious offenses.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control.

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing. Heaven forbid someone speaks more than one language if they work in a major international airport.”","Lucy White shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
