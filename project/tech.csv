To ensure stability and create a safe access point, rescuers constructed a hardwood frame and carefully removed several heavy boulders.

A specialized winch was also employed to move a massive 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) boulder out of the way.Throughout the ordeal, Campbell remained calm and cooperative, assisting the rescuers in their efforts to free her. ""Anything we asked her to do, she was able to do to help us get her out,"" Watts noted. Fortunately, Campbell was freed with only minor scratches and bruises, although her phone was unfortunately left behind in the crevice.Following the incident, Campbell took to Facebook to share a light-hearted post, featuring a photo taken during her rescue that showed her soles wedged between the boulders. She humorously captioned the image, ""Not my feet on display like that,"" accompanied by a laughing emoji. In another post, she jokingly reflected on her accident-prone nature and said, ""No more rock exploration for me for a while.""","Matilda Campbell, 23, was trapped upside down in a crevice between two boulders.

Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108805388,imgsize-32690,width-400,resizemode-4/108805388.jpg"
Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Open system design to offer flexibility of choice in accelerators

Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) has announced the industry’s first 100% fanless direct liquid cooling systems architecture. The company claimed that this architecture will improve the energy and cost efficiency of large-scale AI deployments . The company introduced these systems at its AI Day which is held for members of the financial community at one of its AI systems manufacturing facilities.During the event, the company showcased its position in AI across enterprises, sovereign governments, service providers and model builders.While efficiency has improved in later accelerators, power consumption is continuing to intensify with AI adoption, overtaking traditional cooling techniques. Organisations running large AI workloads will need to do so more efficiently.The most effective way to cool next-generation AI systems is through direct liquid cooling, which HPE already offers. This cooling technology has enabled HPE’s systems to deliver 7 of the top 10 supercomputers on the Green500 list, which ranks the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers.Based on this expertise, HPE’s 100% fanless direct-liquid-cooling architecture brings the cost and energy efficiency benefits that sovereign AI deployments are already enjoying to a broader set of organisations building large-scale generative AI .The system architecture is built on four pillars: An 8-element cooling design that includes liquid cooling for the GPU, CPU, full server blade, local storage, network fabric, rack/cabinet, pod/cluster and coolant distribution unit (CDU).The 100% fanless direct liquid cooling architecture delivers unique benefits – including a 37% reduction in cooling power required per server blade when compared to hybrid direct liquid cooling alone.

Leaked iPhone SE 4 images hint at iPhone 14-like design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/leaked-iphone-se-4-images-hint-at-iphone-14-like-design/articleshow/114411596.cms,"Image courtesy: Macotakara

Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online, sparking speculation about the upcoming budget phone 's design and potential for a larger size option.The images, shared by Japanese tech blog Macotakara, showcase dummy units resembling the recently released iPhone 14 . This suggests the iPhone SE 4 could ditch the older design language in favour of a more modern look, featuring flat edges, a smaller notch for the Face ID system, and a single rear camera.The dummy units reportedly have the same dimensions as the current iPhone SE (146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.8mm), hinting at a familiar form factor. However, the report also mentions the existence of a larger dummy unit, potentially hinting at an "" iPhone SE 4 Plus "" variant with a size similar to the iPhone 14 Plus (6.7-inch display).While Macotakara acknowledges that the existence of a Plus size option is unconfirmed, the possibility has piqued the interest of fans who may favour a larger display on a budget-friendly iPhone.It's important to note that these are leaks based on dummy units, not official confirmation from Apple. While the iPhone 14-inspired design seems likely, the existence of a Plus size model remains unverified.Apple is typically tight-lipped about upcoming products, so fans will need to wait for an official announcement to know for sure what the iPhone SE 4 will look like and what features it will offer.","Images of alleged iPhone SE 4 dummy units have surfaced online.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

Built on TSMC's 3nm process, the chip features two prime cores running at 4.32 GHz and six performance cores at 3.53 GHz, which the chipmaker says is the ""world's fastest mobile CPU.""In benchmark comparisons, Qualcomm claims the Snapdragon 8 Elite outperforms Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 2 ""Lunar Lake"" processors, delivering 45% faster single and multi-core performance while using 27% less power.Graphics performance sees a 40% improvement through a redesigned Adreno GPU with a new sliced architecture running at 1.10GHz. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is also the first mobile chip to fully support Unreal Engine 5.3 and its Nanite geometry system promises for an enhanced gaming experience.The chip's AI processing capabilities have been upgraded with a new Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU) that operates 45% faster than previous versions. This enables on-device support for multimodal AI assistants that can process text, images, and video simultaneously.The Snapdragon 8 Elite brings support for photo captures of up to 320MP and enhances low-light photography capability while also introducing AI-powered features including a video object eraser tool and enhanced HDR processing. The platform also integrates Qualcomm's X80 5G modem , offering theoretical peak download speeds of 10 Gbps.Major smartphone manufacturers including Asus, Honor, OnePlus, Oppo, and Xiaomi are expected to launch devices featuring the Snapdragon 8 Elite within weeks.

South Korea team showcases drone that serves as 'flying shopping cart',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/south-korea-team-showcases-drone-that-serves-as-flying-shopping-cart/articleshow/114448774.cms,"South Korean researchers have developed a transport drone flying on multiple flexible rotors that self-correct to stay level in flight and can be used as a "" flying shopping cart "" to carry goods over uneven terrain such as stairs.The prototype developed by a Seoul National University of Science and Technology team has a cargo platform mounted on top of a multi-rotor drone and is handled by a person using gentle force to guide the hovering aircraft.Members of the team demonstrated the hovering platform with a handle bar much like one on a push shopping cart moving objects up and down stairs and loading boxes on top as it hovered mid-air and maintained its balance by using a centre of mass estimation algorithm.To move objects over uneven terrain or stairs when a wheeled cart cannot, the drone responds to human control with what the developers call a physical human-robot interaction technique that anticipates human intentions for smooth flight, said Lee Seung-jae, professor of mechanical system design engineering.But the broader focus of Lee's team is not on developing a shopping cart to be used over steps, but instead on applications that would use a drone with reliable horizontal stability without pitching and rolling.""The Palletrone can be more than a flying shopping cart,"" he said, referring to the name the team gave the prototype by joining the words pallet, which is the platform for cargo on top, and drone.Lee's team has tested a platform to carry objects up to 3 kg (6.6 lbs), and concedes commercial applications for cargo transportation at such a small weight easily carried by humans is limited.Still, the mechanism that allows the drone to change directions in flight without banking and to maintain level attitude has applications for delivering sensitive or fragile payloads, Lee said.But Lee's team is looking further ahead for the technology's potential use for uncrewed "" flying taxis "" carrying humans and for drones to be ""refuelled"" mid-air, by changing batteries so the aircraft do not need to return to base for a fresh charge.Multi-rotor drones are inherently limited in speed and range compared to fixed-wing drones but have better control and manoeuvrability, including the ability to hover in flight.They have been used to deliver cargo, food and medical supplies, but commercial applications have been limited largely because it is impractical to increase the size of the battery enough to transport a heavier payload over a longer distance.Seoul Tech's work was published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters this year, the publication of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers based in New York.","South Korean researchers develop a transport drone flying on multiple flexible rotors that self-correct to stay level in flight.

Logan Paul's Lunchly Faces Backlash Over Moldy Cheese Controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/logan-pauls-lunchly-faces-backlash-over-moldy-cheese-controversy/articleshow/114468939.cms,"Image via YouTube/ Logan Paul

""This is disgusting. The expiration date was still 2 months away!""

“I was shooting a video comparing Lunchly to Lunchables and I opened the first package, which was meant to be good till December 8th, 2024, and we just got this one, it was fresh from the store this morning and there is a ton of mold in there.”

I Tried Lunchly... It was MOLDY!

“I honestly wasn’t expecting that, I was thinking that, you know, they would taste pretty similar, just, you know, would not have the best, or better for you, ingredients. And I was going to go over nutritional facts and things but this is really concerning so I am just pausing from filming this to take a little break to show this.”

""This is not safe, especially for kids who may not know what mold looks like.""

In a recent controversy surrounding Logan Paul’s Lunchly , a lunch kit marketed as a healthier alternative to Lunchables, concerns have surfaced over mold found in several meal packs. Lunchly, a product launched by two other YouTube celebrities besides Logan Paul - MrBeast, and KSI - in September 2024, combines their existing brands like Prime Hydration and Feastables chocolate.However, since its release, consumers have reported alarming issues with the product.Popular YouTuber Rosanna Pansino highlighted the issue on October 16, 2024, when she found mold in one of the pizza kits from Lunchly. Despite the product’s expiration date being two months away, Pansino encountered mold in the cheese and shared her discovery in a video on social media. She stated,and explained that she had been planning to compare Lunchly with traditional Lunchables but was forced to stop filming due to the contamination. She said,She further stated,This shows that Rosanna was optimistic about Lunchly but Logan Paul along with his business associates failed to live up to her expectations.Other consumers have echoed similar experiences. Multiple reports surfaced online, showing photos and videos of moldy cheese in Lunchly packs, particularly in the pizza kit. Pansino noted that, in some cases, the adhesive seals on the boxes seemed compromised, potentially allowing air inside and causing the mold. In her review, she said,Lunchly representatives responded to the claims, stating that the product undergoes strict quality control, including USDA inspections, before being shipped to retailers. However, these reassurances have done little to alleviate consumer concerns about food safety. With public pressure mounting, it remains to be seen if Logan Paul and his business partners will address the mold issue and ensure higher quality standards for their products.For now, many are awaiting further updates on this growing issue, with consumers hoping for a quick resolution to prevent more incidents of moldy Lunchly kits being sold to families across the country.Also read: WWE faces backlash over racially insensitive segment involving Carlito on Monday Night RAW","Logan Paul launched Lunchly in September 2024, a healthier alternative to Lunchables.

Trade Rumors Erupt on Bryce Young

Young's Response to Trade Rumors



That stuff, I can’t control,"" Young said. ""I’m grateful for where I’m at, I’m grateful to be a part of the Panthers, to be here in the Carolinas—I’m grateful for that. So, that’s how I feel and, obviously, that stuff’s out of my control.

Chosen by the Carolina Panthers as the No. 1 overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, Bryce Young has had a very tough start to his NFL career. A little over half a year into the season, the rise of trade rumors puts this promising young quarterback at the top of talking points that question whether or not he'll remain in Carolina.Also read - Locker Room Drama: Tom Brady Accuses Aaron Rodgers of Sabotaging Jets Amid Mike Williams Trade Talk The young quarterback was the same as so many others in their first year as a league starting quarterback - a work in progress.Ending 2-14 as the starter for the Panthers, he worked his way to a 59.8% completion percentage with 2,877 yards thrown through the air for 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. With all this hope going into the 2024 season, however, the Panthers started 0-2, which prompted head coach Dave Canales to make the switch to veteran Andy Dalton after two games.With the NFL trade deadline arriving soon, Young finds himself at the forefront of trade discussions. The number one pick in 2023 walked into speculation on Tuesday after NFL insider Dianna Russini brought up the possibility that Carolina might consider some sort of trade involving the number one pick. After all, the Panthers continue to flounder, and Young is being shopped accordingly.'"" Russini said, hinting at the growing interest in Young's largely untapped talent.For this season, Young has attempted 65 of 37 passes with 299 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions. Andy Dalton, who replaced him as the starter, carried a 1-4 record, completing 66.3% of his passes for 989 yards, seven touchdowns, and six interceptions.The Panthers had just been thrashed 40-7 by the Washington Commanders. Although Young didn't see a lot of time during the game, having played for only one series at that point, he still will not lose his backup quarterback position for the team, head coach Dave Canales announced.He was pretty diplomatic in answering the reporters about whether or not he would like a fresh start with another squad before the trade deadline, saying ""With the trade deadline expiring in less than an hour to Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, it remains to be seen whether Young will still be a Panther or if he will be traded to another franchise looking to develop the former No. 1 pick.Also read - See Which Hollywood Star Defends Taylor Swift Against NFL Fan Hate as Kayla Nicole Faces Swiftie Backlash","Bryce Young was chosen by the Carolina Panthers as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.
