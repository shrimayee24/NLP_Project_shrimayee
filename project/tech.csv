Caitlin Clark

“I noticed here that coaches here are giving her – not pushing her – but giving her some physicality.”

“That is something that a lot of people have also been talking about online with Caitlin Clark. It seems like she has already gotten a little bit bulkier since the end of the season,”

“Obviously she’s a one-of-a-kind basketball player, but the thing is, she’s not a one-of-a-kind person in the weight room. She has this very high skill set in basketball, but her physical development could really be improved.”

“I think it’s going to be very hard to guard her if she masters her touch at the basket. Her floater game, her mid-range game, and also the long threes that everyone knows and loves,”

“Now I don’t know if that’s because she has been straight in the weight room getting her reps in or it’s the fact that she played an entire NBA season with college and her first WNBA season and she pretty much played like 40 minutes a game,”

“Her floater game, her mid-range game, and also the long threes that everyone knows and loves.”

’s numerous achievement is mostly based on her performance on the court. It looks like her rise to stardom is back to where it belongs — on the basketball court. After months of attention centered on accolades like her TIME magazine honor and debates about her impact on the WNBA , the focus has returned to her game.The shift in Clark’s approach is clear. A recent training video shared by the Indiana Fever’s social media accounts showcased Clark practicing her skills while coaches incorporated more physicality into her drills. This approach is no accident. Analyst Rachel DeMita noted in her YouTube video,Physicality has become a key talking point for Caitlin Clark’s development, and it’s not just about what’s happening in practice. Fans and analysts alike have observed a noticeable change in her physique.DeMita remarked.This evolution in Clark’s approach isn’t new. During her senior year at Iowa, Clark gained 8 pounds and this was because her opponents were physically targeting her. Iowa’s associate strength and conditioning coach, Lindsay Alexander, reflected on her progress, saying,Clark’s offseason training isn’t limited to physical gains. Reports suggest she’s sharpening critical elements of her game, including ball handling, off-balance finishing, mid-range shots, screen navigation, and, of course, her long-distance three-pointers.DeMita emphasized that this enhanced version of Clark will be a nightmare for opposing defenses.she stated.There’s also speculation about the source of Clark’s bulkier frame. DeMita posed an interesting theory, suggesting that her grueling schedule since her senior year at Iowa — playing college basketball, Olympic games, and her first WNBA season — might have contributed to the change.she explained.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 The WNBA’s 12 teams and 144 players will have to adjust to Caitlin Clark’s new training and transformation.

A sudden water leak in the cabin had flyers fearing they might ""drown"" at 30,000 feet above ground.The unexpected flooding began when a leak in a rear restroom sent water streaming down the aisle toward the front of the plane, as per the New York Post. Hilary Stewart Blazevic, a passenger, told Storyful that a woman alerted a flight attendant about the leak after using the restroom. The crew failed to stop the leakage despite their best efforts.“It was utter disbelief and a little panic,” Blazevic recounted, explaining how passengers scrambled to lift their feet and belongings out of the “disgusting” water pooling on the floor.A viral TikTok video, which has now garnered over 7.2 million views, captured the chaos onboard. The clip, humorously set to Céline Dion’s My heart will go on, the theme song from the 1997 Titanic film — showed panicked passengers trying to escape the gush.

Rapper Bow Wow Slams Travis Hunter’s Fiancee Leanna Lenee



Leanna Lenee Has Received Extreme Hate In The Last Few Days



Travis Hunter and his would-be wife Leanna Lenee have again found themselves in the middle of a controversy. Bow Wow, a famous rapper has taken to his social media to advise Travis about his future with Leanna. It seems like Bow is not that fond of Leanna and has asked Travis to be careful. Bow mentioned he had once been of Travis’ age and had a lavish lifestyle, so he “knows how this sh*t go.” As per Yahoo, Bow said, “I was once young, about to make a lot of money, and I know how this shit go. So I need you to hear me out. No. 1: I don’t want you feeling as though everybody’s jumping down your back or cats is hating. That’s that young (expletive) mentality. I want you to look at this like (expletive) care about you.""Bow also added that all he is doing is “waking Travis up.” He continued to tell Travis that he would not be telling him what his next moves should be but he should be careful. Fans quickly decoded that this sudden reaction of Bow is regarding Leanna and he is asking Travis to be careful of Leanna’s “intentions.”But as luck would have it, instead of Leanna it was Bow who got trolled. Apparently, Bow fell for a fake screenshot which was posted by a page called @NBACentel. The screenshot showed Leanna dropping a comment on Anthony Edwards, a professional NBA player. Bow thought it was a real screenshot and went on to advise Travis about how it was wrong of his would-be wife to comment on another man’s picture like that on a public platform.Bow added, “There’s no reason why she’s commenting on another (expletive) page… with heart eyes and the (expletive) money tongue out. That’s your fiancée. Wake up, young brother. Fiancées don’t move like that… It’s like you’re so caught up in being in love. I don’t think this woman even loves you like that.

Charles Barkley is full-on Christmas spirit



NBA legend turned sports analyst Charles Barkley has been an avid entertainer in the studio. During a Christmas special broadcast by TNT, Barkley made his fans laugh through a hilarious on-air outburst. Of course, Barkley has never hesitated to make his voice heard, be it his bold statement or hilarious banter. As he enjoys the fruits of his whopping $210 million contract with the network, Barkley made sure to throw a little spice in a funny Christmas special. The moment became an instant sensation among the NBA community.As Christmas approaches, the air in the TNT studio has been sparkled with humor. NBA legend Charles Barkley joined his fellow hosts Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal in an awkward Christmas photoshoot— something special for fans. However, the moment became the funhouse as the Hall of Famer went on with his full humorous banter.The Inside Guys brought out their best (or worst) holiday looks, complete with ugly sweaters and awkward poses, to surprise fans. While Sir Charles initially played the part of the grumpy holdout, he managed to channel his inner holiday hero, much like the Grinch turning into an unlikely Santa. In the end, Barkley delivered his own unique charm to the celebration.The social media handle of The NBA on TNT sent out their Christmas greetings in a lighthearted way, sharing an ""awkward Christmas photoshoot"" featuring the Inside Guys. “The Fellas REALLY got into the Christmas spirit with this one,” the page posted on X. Fans were also treated to a behind-the-scenes look at how the quirky shoot came together. Judging by the final product, the photoshoot was planned well in advance. Notably, Ernie Johnson, a familiar face on the show, was absent this Thursday following the sudden loss of his sister. In his place, Adam Lefkoe stepped in to keep the show rolling during this bittersweet holiday broadcast.Barkley walked into the studio, took one look at the wrinkled brown backdrop, the oversized Shaq-a-Claus gift bag, and the pile of fake presents, and let out a weary sigh. “Oh, this can’t be good,” he muttered. The Inside Guys donned their ugly Christmas sweaters, with Chuck picking the infamous one that makes him look like a giant gift wrapped with a bow. “They don’t pay me enough to look this ridiculous,” he quipped.Also Read: Charles Barkley makes bold prediction for Orlando Magic’s forward Paolo Banchero They do, TNT signed the NBA legend with a massive $210 million contract in 2022. Shaquille O’Neal, another NBA legend on the show, responded with a hint of pride in their fanbase, “If we come up with a sweater line, the public would buy it.” Barkley was surprised by O’Neal’s response to the sweater line as he revealed that the legend already had a retail price in his mind, it would be $20 apiece. It would be interesting to see if fans propel him to open the line flooding with responses on social media. Regardless, the post-card-like photoshoot was hilarious which sparked laughter among fans while lifting the Christmas spirit in the studio.","NBA legend turned sports analyst Charles Barkley has been an avid entertainer in the studio.

Is Netflix over Harry and Meghan?

Polo flops and “box office poison” drama

Cookery show under pressure

The Sussex struggle: From Hollywood darlings to “colossal bombs”

Crisis control or end of the road?

It seems like the honeymoon phase between Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Netflix is officially over. Once hailed as the streaming platform’s dream duo, the Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits.The latest debacle? Their five-part documentary about polo, which critics have torched as a “tedious inside look” and a “dull indulgence.” One reviewer even joked it felt like a spoof designed to play in the background of Succession.As per the sources quoted by the Daily Mail, Netflix executives are “exhausted” from working with Markle. The fallout is apparently so bad that her upcoming cookery show—still without a premiere date—is being labeled as her “make or break” moment. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.Adding fuel to the fire, there’s been zero buzz around the polo series. No press tours, no promotional events, no hype. Even Nacho Figueras, Harry’s polo pal and a star of the series, has barely mentioned it on social media. Hollywood veteran Sean McNulty told The Daily Beast: “The lack of a proper press campaign for a Harry and Meghan project is eyebrow-raising, to say the least.”According to reports, Meghan’s cookery show is now the Sussexes’ last hope at staying in Netflix’s good graces. One entertainment exec was quotes by the Daily Mail as saying, “Her show will have to be an enormous hit to turn around their deal and their reputations in this town.”The show is expected to drop in early 2024, coinciding with Harry’s appearance at the Winter Invictus Games in Canada and the launch of Meghan’s homeware brand, American Riviera Orchard . Talk about multitasking under pressure.Critics are having a field day with Harry and Meghan’s current reputation—or lack thereof. Marketing expert Tony Case didn’t mince words, was quoted by the Daily Beast as saying, “Harry and Meghan are box office poison. Everyone is running away from this colossal bomb.”He added, “They set out to conquer America, but no one here found them—or what they’re selling—to be particularly compelling.”Even their highly-publicized project Meet Me at the Lake, based on a best-selling novel, remains in limbo. With no production in sight, it’s unlikely to materialize before their Netflix deal is up for renewal next year.Friends who once hyped their projects are unusually quiet, fueling speculation that Hollywood may be losing patience with the couple. A source quoted in Closer Magazine tried to defend the Sussexes, blaming Netflix for pushing a “reality TV angle” that was out of their control.","The Sussexes’ partnership with Netflix has hit a rough patch, with insiders whispering about mounting frustration and dwindling faith in their ability to deliver hits. “It’s so much work with her, and, bluntly, the ‘deliverable’ does not seem to be worth it,” one insider said.

How the

Cultural Instincts

That Divide Us Can Help Bring Us Together by Michael Morris

Tribalism , defined as primal hatred for out-groups, is tearing the world apart, say pundits. Butshows tribal instincts are a superpower. These must be recognised, to remedy tendencies when they go out of range.We survived by pooling knowledge, coalescing in clans, feeling solidarity within small groups, nested in larger communities. This has wired us in three ways: the peer code, the hero code and the ancestor code, each triggered by situational and inner needs.We learn from social inferences, including the idea of what’s ‘normal’ behaviour. Americans smile for the camera, Russians look serious. Peer codes vary by community, so we perform different mannerisms in a gym or at a corporate event. Dress and language policies can trigger peer codes, often those of an organisational culture, say the military or medical settings. Lee Kuan Yew shifted bicultural Singapore’s norms to a British rules-based one by changing uniform and language. High-pressure settings, or uncertainty, heightens conformity.The pull of heroism, of prestige and reputation, is another powerful tribal code. Society pays tribute to those of high status and contributions, we emulate their actions. It’s why tech founders wear black turtlenecks like Steve Jobs. Hero codes are evoked by a tribe’s symbols and icons, whether it’s the national flag or totem animals. Leaders like Martin Luther King or Zelenskyy have adeptly employed language and symbol rather than rational argument to trigger group ideals.Another tribal instinct is tradition. We are driven to maintain and defend our ancestors’ ways. They often encode critical lessons about the environment, like the seafaring Moken people who knew to retreat from a tsunami. Tribal ceremonies, whether it’s a Catholic mass, a Greek wedding or a party’s electoral convention, or the New Zealand football team’s haka ritual, reference the collective past, and spur volunteering and commitment.But all these codes can be spotted and shifted. Prevalence signals can change peer codes and habits. If you want to encourage a particular behaviour, say voting, ‘everyone is doing it’ appeals work better than ‘don’t be part of the problem’. For most people, the inner conformist is stronger than the inner activist. Latin American soap operas spurred women to limit family size, contrary to what priests and politicians had told them. Celebrities and influencers gain prestige from fame itself. People are wired to soak up social signals. A reconciliation drama between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda worked, not because it changed hearts, but because it changed the perception of the cultural ideal, of what society approves of.Changing a toxic culture involves bringing in new prestige signals. Satya Nadella refreshed Microsoft by modelling humility and listening through example, changing a know-it-all culture to a learn-it-all one. Some schools fought bullying by co-opting high-status students, rather than official admonishments. In-group messengers deliver more effectively.Precedence signals, signs of long lineage can also be used. Tribal lines can be redrawn when a leader uses the power of myth, as Nelson Mandela reconciled apartheid-torn South Africa through rugby symbols. Ripples of change can be created by exploiting tribal psychology, as Gandhi did for India.We are not just rational seekers of self-interest: we imitate peers, emulate heroes and perpetuate traditions. Understanding our interactions as communities can take us towards the common good.","We learn from social inferences, including the idea of what’s ‘normal’ behaviour.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

“Brooding and Sexy” or Just Overkill?



Mayor Adams Joins the Circus



Romanticising the “CEO Assassin”



A Case of Public Perception



Move over, Hollywood—there’s a new heartthrob in town, and he’s not starring in the next blockbuster. Luigi Mangione , a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate turned accused murderer , has become the internet’s latest obsession after an NYPD perp walk so dramatic it could have been choreographed by Scorsese himself.Dressed in an orange jumpsuit that screamed main character energy, Mangione was marched into Manhattan federal court flanked by a security detail so excessive it looked like an Avengers reunion. Helicopters hovered. Cameras flashed. And, for reasons no one can quite figure out, New York City Mayor Eric Adams himself tagged along like an over-eager extra.The scene was more “GQ cover shoot” than grim judicial process, and social media had thoughts.The internet wasted no time turning the moment into meme fodder. One X (formerly Twitter) user joked, “Did they stage this? Dude looks like a better-looking Jesus on his way to trial.” Another chimed in, “We’re really pretending this is the villain in a Christopher Nolan film, huh?”Joyce Carol Oates, never one to miss a cultural flashpoint, weighed in with her usual flair: “What bad boy wouldn’t be thrilled to require 25 armed men to escort him even while shackled? Flattering, really.”But the pièce de résistance? The fan edits. Within hours, Luigi Mangione was reimagined as a misunderstood antihero, complete with black-and-white slow-mo clips and Lana Del Rey soundtracks. If his legal team were half as efficient as his internet stans, he’d probably be out on bail already.And then there was Eric Adams. The mayor’s inexplicable presence in Mangione’s escort squad raised eyebrows—and plenty of snark. One commenter quipped, “Eric Adams getting his practice run for when it’s his turn,” a cheeky nod to the mayor’s ongoing corruption investigation.Others questioned his motivations. “Is this about Mangione, or is this about Adams looking tough?” mused legal analyst Robert Weisberg. Spoiler: It’s probably both.Critics have slammed the NYPD for turning Mangione into an unlikely sex symbol. Yale’s Jorge Camacho warned about the prejudicial nature of perp walks, while another expert called the whole spectacle “particularly staged.”But let’s face it—if the goal was to make Mangione look like a dangerous mastermind, it kind of backfired. One X user summed it up perfectly: “He’s tall, brooding, and handsome. Thanks for the free press, NYPD. Can’t wait for the Dateline special.”As the legal saga unfolds, it’s clear that Mangione’s case is as much about optics as it is about justice. Is he a cold-blooded killer or a misunderstood man pushed to his limits? Depends on who you ask—and what filter they’re using.In the end, the NYPD may have transported a criminal, but social media transported him straight to Tumblr heartthrob status. Somewhere, his PR team (assuming he has one) is furiously taking notes.Stay tuned.

Vivek Ramaswamy's controversial take on transgenderism resurfaces: ‘Mental health disorder’ remarks spark debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamys-controversial-take-on-transgenderism-resurfaces-mental-health-disorder-remarks-spark-debate/articleshow/116495299.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy (File image)

An old video of Indian-American biotech entrepreneur and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy has resurfaced on social media, reigniting the debate on transgenderism and LGBTQ+ issues. The video, shared by @DefiantWorld on X (formerly Twitter), features Ramaswamy describing transgenderism as a ""mental health disorder"" and opposing gender-affirming surgeries for minors, particularly those under the age of 18.In the video, Ramaswamy explains his controversial stance, asserting that “transgenderism is a mental health disorder” and that practices like gender-affirming surgeries for minors should be banned. He argued that this approach is actually “the compassionate thing to do for children,” explaining that minors should not be allowed to make irreversible changes to their bodies that they may later regret.Ramaswamy went on to share a personal anecdote from his visit to New Hampshire, where he met two young women who underwent significant medical procedures at a young age. ""One of them was just 13 years old when she had a double mastectomy, and the other had a hysterectomy. Both of them were on puberty blockers, and the sad part is, they regret it,” Ramaswamy said. “It’s actually the compassionate thing to do for children.”Further, Ramaswamy compared gender-affirming surgeries to tattooing, emphasizing that just as minors are prohibited from getting tattoos, they should also be protected from irreversible body changes. “We don’t allow kids to make permanent changes to their bodies, and for good reason—because they could regret it later. Why should we treat something as serious as this any differently?”Despite the backlash his remarks have received, Ramaswamy defended his position, emphasizing the need for compassionate care. “It’s not that I condemn any kid for going through confusion,"" he stated. “But we need to help them address what's going wrong in their life. Affirming their confusion is cruelty.”The video, which has gone viral once again, has led to intense discussion online, with many asking, “Do you agree with Vivek’s answer?” As the clip makes rounds, opinions remain sharply divided—some argue that Ramaswamy’s stance is harmful and dismissive of transgender individuals, while others support his call for more caution and regulation regarding medical interventions for minors .","An old video of Indian-American biotech entrepreneur and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy has resurfaced on social media.

A flashback to a different moment

Melania’s limited public role

A love story spanning decades

A photo of US President-elect Donald Trump sharing a kiss with his wife, Melania , at a baseball game is going viral, with social media buzzing with mixed reactions.In the image, Trump, dressed in a suit with a peach-colored tie, is seen kissing Melania, who is wearing a black dress. The couple is seated in the stadium, surrounded by spectators—some smiling at the affectionate moment, while others continue to focus on the game. The candid image has captured the attention of many, fueling a variety of reactions online.Social media users are divided, with many expressing affection for the couple’s public display of love. One user commented, ""Mom and Dad are so adorable!"" while another quipped, ""Let the woman breathe."" Others shared their admiration, saying things like, ""Now THAT is how to handle the kiss cam kiss!"" Some fans even joked about wishing they could be in Melania's place.This viral moment comes on the heels of a less affectionate public appearance earlier this year. In July, a video surfaced showing Melania Trump avoiding a kiss from her husband during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. As Trump leaned in to kiss Melania after securing the Republican nomination for 2024, she appeared to subtly sidestep the gesture, sparking widespread commentary and speculation across social media.Since the start of Trump’s second presidential campaign, Melania has kept a relatively low public profile. She has appeared at select events, such as the Republican National Convention and the Al Smith dinner in New York, but has remained mostly out of the spotlight. Much of her time has been focused on supporting her son Barron as he transitions to college life at New York University. Balancing her life between New York and Palm Beach, Melania’s decision to prioritize family has contributed to her quieter role during the campaign.Trump has shared that his wife will participate in his second term as First Lady as needed, assuring her supporters that she will be involved at appropriate moments.The couple's love story began in 2004 when Trump proposed to Melania at the Met Gala. They married in 2005 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, and in 2006, welcomed their son Barron. Over the years, they’ve shared many significant moments together, and this latest viral kiss is just another chapter in their public life as a married couple.While social media continues to react to the photo, one thing is clear: Donald and Melania Trump’s relationship remains a focal point of public interest as they continue their journey in the political spotlight.","A photo of US President-elect Donald Trump sharing a kiss with his wife, Melania, at a baseball game is going viral.

Hawk Tuah Girl: Where is Hailey Welch?

Hailey Welch , the viral sensation behind the "" Hawk Tuah "" catchphrase, has disappeared from the public eye—leaving her millions of fans wondering what happened.The last episode of her hit podcast Talk Tuah aired on Dec. 3, and since then, Welch has gone silent. No updates on her social media, no new episodes of her popular podcast, and no word on her whereabouts. Her fans, who had been riding high on her meteoric rise, are now left puzzled and frustrated.Welch’s sudden rise to fame seemed like a fairy tale. After her viral ""Hawk Tuah"" video exploded across the internet, Welch turned the catchphrase into a full-fledged brand. She launched merchandise and then, in September, a weekly podcast that soared to the top of the Spotify charts. Everything seemed to be falling into place for the influencer-turned-entrepreneur.But things took a turn when Welch launched her own cryptocurrency—$HAWK, the Hawk Tuah memecoin—on Dec. 4. Initially, the coin soared in value, briefly reaching a market cap of hundreds of millions of dollars. However, within minutes, it collapsed, wiping out the investments of countless fans. Many speculated that insiders had dumped their tokens, profiting off the crash while leaving regular buyers to bear the losses.Welch's attempt to address the controversy only deepened the mystery. During a live audio stream on X (formerly Twitter) with her partners at OverHere , who helped launch the memecoin, Welch appeared to brush off the criticisms. ""Hey guys! I hate to interrupt you, Nick, but hello there. Anywho, I'm gonna go to bed and I'll see you guys tomorrow,"" she casually remarked, before abruptly leaving the conversation. That was the last anyone heard from Welch.Her sudden exit has sparked a mix of reactions online. Some are calling it a “career-ending move,” while others seem more sympathetic, jokingly referring to her as “Sleeping Beauty.” One user remarked, ""Her career ended in the same year it started.""But the saga of the $HAWK coin is far from over. While Welch remains silent, her crypto partners have made public statements, attempting to shift blame onto Alex Larson Schultz, known as ""Doc Hollywood."" OverHere alleges that Schultz was in charge of key decisions related to the coin, including token distribution and financial management. Schultz, who is a music producer and the son-in-law of comedian Howie Mandel, has not yet commented on these accusations.As Welch remains unreachable, the controversy continues to grow. On Dec. 7, investors who lost money in the $HAWK collapse filed a lawsuit, accusing the creators of selling unregistered securities.For now, the public is left waiting—both for Welch’s next move and for the next chapter in the $HAWK memecoin disaster .","Hailey Welch, the viral sensation behind the "" Hawk Tuah "" catchphrase, has disappeared from the public eye.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
