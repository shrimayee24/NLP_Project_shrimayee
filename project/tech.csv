Patna Headlines Today — Key Stories You Shouldn’t Miss.







Sonepur division of the East Central Railway (ECR), which recently introduced an innovative system called Q-Mitra at Begusarai station under pilot project, has evoked good response from passengers so far.This new system is designed to allow passengers to procure Tatkal tickets quickly and seamlessly, leveraging cutting-edge technology for a hassle-free experience.Under the system, passengers can now obtain a token before the opening of the Tatkal ticket booking window at 10am for both AC and sleeper class. The token will be generated through an AI-based face recognition system integrated with Aadhaar-based authentication. The process ensures complete transparency and eliminates the need for passengers to stand in queues, said Sonepur divisional railway manager (DRM) Amit Saran.Once the token is issued, passengers can proceed to book their Tatkal tickets smoothly, while maintaining full transparency throughout the process. The system captures the last four digits of the passenger’s Aadhaar number, which is cross-referenced with the face recognition data, adding an additional layer of security to prevent fraudulent activities, the DRM said.According to the DRM, the new system ensures that each passenger can book a Tatkal ticket only once per day. This rule effectively blocks any attempt to book multiple tickets within a short time frame, ensuring fairness and equitable access to the Tatkal ticket window, he said, adding Q-Mitra marks a major step towards modernising the ticket booking process and addressing long-standing challenges faced by train passengers in the region.According to Sonepur senior divisional commercial manager (senior DCM) Raushan Kumar, utilising AI and Aadhaar-based identification, the Q-Mitra initiative promises to streamline operations and improve the overall travel experience. “The Q-Mitra not only reduces waiting time, but also ensures greater transparency in the ticket booking process,” Kumar said.He said the system that will be gradually rolled out across various stations in the Sonepur division is expected to serve as a model for other railway divisions in the days to come.","East Central Railway's Sonepur division has launched Q-Mitra at Begusarai station, a pilot project using AI and Aadhaar for swift Tatkal ticket booking.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture

India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention. This geological defiance has influenced settlement patterns, pilgrimage routes, dam construction, ecological debates, and identities for centuries across western India.The Narmada is the river that flows west instead of east. It is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres. The Narmada River does not empty into the Bay of Bengal like the Ganga or Godavari do. It travels steadily westward from its source until it eventually reaches the Arabian Sea.The Tapi is another prominent example of the few big Indian rivers that follow this path. The idea that the Narmada runs ""backwards"" originates from the fact that the majority of the region's rivers flow in the opposite direction, eastward.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled. Along its course, dams, towns, temples, agriculture, and monsoon patterns shape livelihoods, ecosystems, and cultural rhythms for millions of people.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. While the upper areas are hilly and forested, with less people living nearby, the land becomes flatter and more open when you go further west. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

"‘Purpose of task vs. job’: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explains why AI will change jobs, not eliminate them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/purpose-of-task-vs-job-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-explains-why-ai-will-change-jobs-not-eliminate-them/articleshow/127138253.cms,"Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

AI helps Jensen Huang type less, but think more

Software engineering and hiring growth

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs.

Gym syndicate targeted Hindu women for religious conversion in UP; GRP head constable among 6 arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/gym-syndicate-targeted-30-hindus-women-for-religious-conversion/articleshow/127324194.cms,"Lucknow Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







LUCKNOW: Police investigation into the gym syndicate that ran an illegal religious conversion and AI-backed blackmail racket in Mirzapur has revealed that the gang targeted as many as 30 women. The gang was busted after two victims blew the lid off.Most of the victims were Hindu women who had joined the chain of five gyms for physical training. The gang targeted women by creating their AI-generated obscene videos and used them to blackmail and pressure them for religious conversion. The racket had been running since 2021, said police.Six accused, including a GRP head constable Irshad Khan, 40, have been arrested.The other five accused include gym owners and trainers — Mohammad Sheikh Ali Alam, 31, Faizal Khan, 34, Zaheer, 32, Shadab, 36, and Farid Ahmed, 28.Obscene AI-edited videos and photos recovered from the mobiles of the accused are a key evidence in the case, said police. The prime accused, gym owner Farid Ahmed, was arrested in an encounter after allegedly opening fire on a police team during a raid.SP/DIG Mirzapur, Somen Barma, told TOI that the racket came to light after two young women lodged separate complaints earlier this month, alleging that they were trapped, blackmailed, and pressured to change their religion using AI-generated obscene videos.Barma said the accused used to befriend women who joined their gyms and gradually gained access to their personal photographs and videos.""These were then morphed using AI tools to create explicit and obscene content. The victims were subsequently threatened with circulation of these AI-edited videos on social media unless they complied with the gang's demands, which included sexual exploitation and coercion to convert religion,"" Barma added.""Recovered mobiles contain dozens of AI-generated obscene videos and chats,"" said another senior officer, adding that most of the accused are Class dropouts.GRP head constable Irshad Khan, posted in Bhadohi, allegedly provided logistical support and protection to the syndicate.Investigators said that 4 of the 5 gyms — KGN-1.0, KGN-2.0, KGN-3.0, B-Fit, and Iron Fire — were run by 3 brothers and their brother-in-law.Mirzapur DM Pawan Kumar Gangwar has sealed all five gyms under the scanner till Feb 27.Police are trying to trace more and find whether the racket had links beyond Mirzapur. Digital forensics teams are analysing data to determine how widely the AI-generated content was shared and whether similar methods were used in other districts.""This was not just a blackmail case.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Wordle rarely announces itself loudly, yet it still manages to interrupt routines. A few minutes with five letters can stretch longer than expected, especially when early guesses refuse to settle. Today’s puzzle, listed as Wordle #1679 for January 23, 2026, follows that familiar pattern of quiet resistance. Nothing looks unusual at first glance, but the answer tends to stay just out of reach. Some players will feel close almost immediately; others not at all. The grid fills, colours appear, and confidence shifts with every line. For anyone stuck midway through, a small nudge can help without giving the game away.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.Today’s Wordle AnswerThe answer to Wordle #1679 on January 23, 2026, is:Meaning: A low-ranking male member of the nobilityor an extremely powerful person in a particular area of businessWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Coastal & Island Areas: Expect pleasant highs between 20°C and 24°C.

Internal Regions: Slightly warmer but still cool, ranging from 22°C to 26°C.

Mountainous Peaks: If you are heading to Jebel Jais, bundle up! Temperatures are hovering between a crisp 12°C and 18°C, with recent lows previously hitting near-freezing points.

The Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has advised drivers to slow down, ensure headlights and wipers are working, and allow extra travel time during rain and wind.

(RTA) has advised drivers to slow down, ensure headlights and wipers are working, and allow extra travel time during rain and wind. With wind gusts predicted to pick up at times and occasional blowing dust expected, visibility could drop suddenly, especially on highways and open stretches.

Sea conditions are forecast to be moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea, potentially disrupting small boats and beach activities.

What to expect next





While the UAE is known for its golden sun, residents woke up to a very different scene this Monday morning. A powerful low-pressure system has officially moved in, bringing with it a rare and dramatic display of nature: hail.As dawn broke, social media was flooded with videos from Al Rams and northern areas of Ras Al Khaimah, showing streets covered in small hailstones. This icy start wasn't just limited to the north; overnight rainfall has been soaking parts of Fujairah and Al Ain, turning the desert landscape into a cool, misty escape. For many, it’s a much-needed relief, but for those on the morning commute, it’s a signal to slow down and stay alert.According to the National Center of Meteorology (NCM), the current weather ""unsettledness"" is caused by an extension of a surface low-pressure system from the Red Sea, paired with an upper-air low. In simpler terms: cold air from the north is meeting moisture, creating perfect conditions for rain and hail.The temperature drop is noticeable across the board:As the unsettled weather continues, authorities are urging motorists and residents to take precautions:These advisories come amid a broader trend of weather system impacts on travel, daily life and coastal activities, with authorities emphasising caution near flood-prone or exposed areas.If you’re wondering whether to keep your umbrella handy, the answer is yes, but only for a little longer. The NCM predicts that while the rain may persist in northern and eastern regions throughout the day, the system will gradually weaken.However, a new challenge awaits early-morning commuters: fog. As the humidity rises and the winds calm down, thick mist is expected to blanket internal and coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Visibility could drop significantly, so if you have an early flight or a long drive, plan for extra time.","Temperatures are hovering between a crisp 12°C and 18°C, with recent lows previously hitting near-freezing points.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

Explained: The SNL joke about Usha Vance being JD Vance's 'beard',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-the-snl-joke-about-usha-vance-being-jd-vances-beard/articleshow/127493951.cms,"‘Missile Fired At US’: Vance Drops New Greenland Bombshell | Why Trump Needs Control Of Arctic





This week’s Saturday Night Live cold open began with a parody awards ceremony called The Trumps, a familiar SNL device that reimagines the Oscars through the narcissistic logic of Donald Trump. The premise itself was broad and accessible: Trump hosting an awards night celebrating himself, his administration, and the institutions he claims to have bent to his will. As with most SNL cold opens, the sketch was designed to function on multiple frequencies at once, mixing easy political satire with sharper, culturally specific jokes aimed at audiences fluent in online discourse.One of those sharper moments arrived via a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo by J. D. Vance, played by Mikey Day. In the sketch, Vance jokes that if he becomes president in 2028, he would be the first US president with a beard in a hundred years. Trump immediately snaps back: “Speaking of your ‘beard’, how is your wife Usha?”On the surface, the line registers as a typical Trump-style insult, a crude pivot from facial hair to marriage delivered for a quick laugh. But that surface reading misses what the joke is actually doing. The word “beard” is not accidental. It is a piece of queer terminology smuggled into a network television sketch, and its meaning is precise. In queer slang, a “beard” refers not to facial hair, but to a partner used as a heterosexual cover, historically by queer individuals who felt pressure to conceal their sexuality in hostile social or professional environments.That particular joke has circulated for years in online spaces, forming part of the same rumour ecosystem as the infamous JD Vance couch joke. The SNL line riffs on a long-circulating internet innuendo suggesting that Vance is queer and that Usha Vance functions as his “beard”. The show is not making a factual claim. Instead, it is exploiting a piece of subcultural vocabulary that many casual viewers will not recognise, while others will immediately understand the implication.This kind of layered humour is central to how SNL has survived in the social media era. The cold open has become less about telling a single joke clearly, and more about stacking references that travel well online. A line like this generates clips, screenshots, and explainers precisely because it splits the audience. If you do not know the slang, the joke passes as crude banter. If you do, it lands as a deliberately provocative wink, one that feels far more transgressive than the sketch otherwise suggests.The reason the joke works at all is because JD Vance’s personal life has already been folded into internet speculation in a way few mainstream politicians experience. JD and Usha Vance’s relationship has been the subject of unusually persistent gossip, much of it incubated in MAGA-adjacent online spaces where personal narratives are treated as ideological battlegrounds. While Usha Vance recently announced her fourth child, the internet briefly went into overdrive when she was spotted without her wedding ring, an absence her publicist dismissed as innocuous.That moment fed into a broader rumour cycle that has little regard for evidence but enormous appetite for symbolism. Around the same time, many online commentators, and even mainstream figures such as Joy Reid, amplified claims that JD Vance was preparing to “divorce” Usha Vance and instead marry a so-called “white queen”, Erika Kirk. The rumour drew on racial, ideological, and aesthetic anxieties within Trumpworld, casting Usha Vance as an inconvenient mismatch in a movement increasingly obsessed with cultural homogeneity.None of these claims have been substantiated. But in contemporary political culture, truth is often secondary to circulation. By the time SNL referenced the joke, it had already become part of the ambient background noise surrounding Vance’s public image, familiar enough to be recognisable, even if only to a niche audience.That is the ecosystem SNL now operates in. The show does not originate these narratives. It harvests them, compresses them, and refracts them through satire. In this case, a single word, “beard”, operates as a cultural dog whistle, quietly importing years of online rumour, queer slang, and political gossip into a five-second exchange. Most viewers will miss it. Some will laugh without knowing why. And a smaller group will recognise exactly what the joke is doing, and why it feels sharper, and crueller, than it first appears.","Saturday Night Live's The Trumps opened with Donald Trump hosting an awards ceremony.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working. Such observations also guide conservation planning, policy decisions, habitat restoration priorities, and long-term monitoring strategies across regions facing climate variability.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place is a sign of ecological vigour.

"Sweden unearths a 5,000-year-old dog buried with a dagger, hints at elite treatment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/sweden-unearths-a-5000-year-old-dog-buried-with-a-dagger-hints-at-elite-treatment/articleshow/127505466.cms,"The ‘ dog burial ’ that stopped archaeologists in their tracks

What the dagger reveals about the burial

What archaeologists hope to learn next





Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: The well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago alongside a carefully crafted dagger made from bone. The burial was found in a wetland that was once a lake, a setting that helped protect fragile remains for millennia. What makes the find so fascinating is how deliberate it appears. This was not a random deposit or scattered bones. The placement suggests intention, meaning, and possibly even ceremony. To researchers, the message is clear: This dog may have been valued far beyond an ordinary animal.The dog’s skeleton was found in remarkably good condition, especially for something this old. It was uncovered by archaeologists from Arkeologerna, a unit within Sweden’s National Historical Museums, during an excavation at Logsjomossen near Jarna linked to construction work for the Ostlanken railway project. Because the burial lay in waterlogged sediments from what was once a lake, the wetland environment helped preserve fragile organic remains far better than normal soil would. What struck researchers immediately was how intentional it looked, as if someone had carefully placed the dog there rather than leaving it behind as simple waste.Alongside the dog was a polished bone dagger, described as long and finely made. In prehistoric societies, objects like this were not casual possessions. A blade tool could represent skill, status, or even symbolic meaning, depending on the culture and context.The fact that it was placed with the dog suggests the animal had significance. The dagger may have been a grave gift, a sign of honour, or something meant to accompany the dog in death.Dogs in the Stone Age were not only companions. They could be protectors, hunting partners, trackers, and vital members of daily survival. A strong, reliable dog might have been seen as part of the group’s success, especially in harsh environments where every advantage mattered.A careful burial could reflect gratitude, respect, or an emotional bond. It may also indicate that this dog held a special role, possibly linked to hunting, guarding, or ritual significance in the community.The burial was found in sediments that once sat at the bottom of a shallow lake. That detail matters because water and wetlands have long been associated with ritual deposits in ancient Europe. People often placed valued objects into lakes, bogs, and rivers as offerings or ceremonial acts.If this was a ritual burial, it adds a deeper layer to the story. It suggests the dog was not only important in life, but still held meaning after death.Discoveries like this rarely give up their secrets immediately. Researchers will likely study the remains through dating and lab analysis to understand details such as the dog’s life, diet, health, and age at death.Over time, the burial could help answer bigger questions about how Stone Age people in Scandinavia lived, what role dogs played in their societies, and how early humans expressed loyalty, care, and respect for animals that shared their world.","Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: the well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago.

A travel reset worth the road trip from UAE to Khasab







If you are in the UAE and craving a break from the city buzz but don't want to hop on a long flight, there is a serene, breathtaking corner of the Arabian Peninsula that is quietly becoming one of the Middle East ’s most rewarding nature getaways: Khasab in Oman. Often called the “Norway of Arabia”, this fjord-lined coastal town on the Musandam Peninsula delivers dramatic scenery, calm turquoise waters, playful marine life and a slower pace that feels like another world entirely, all just a short road trip away.Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE. It is roughly a 2.5-hour drive from Dubai but once you cross the border, the striking landscape of steep mountains, fjord-like inlets and clear sea instantly wipes away any sense of city stress. The drive itself sets the tone, winding along coastal cliffs that plunge into deep, brilliant blue waters. There is little traffic and plenty of photo stops and by the time you reach Khasab, the transition from urban rush to nature’s calm is complete.What really sets Khasab apart is its dramatic fjords. These towering rock formations rising directly from glassy sea create a landscape that feels more like Scandinavia than the Arabian Peninsula. Taking a traditional Omani dhow cruise through these waterways is one of the quintessential ways to experience the region, with gentle breezes, calm seas and panoramic viewpoints in every direction.On these dhow boats you will often spot dolphins swimming alongside, a crowd-delighting feature of many cruises, especially in calmer morning waters.Local tour companies emphasise the high chances of dolphin sightings and immersive experiences that include swimming and snorkelling in sheltered coves.One of Khasab’s most magical moments is how effortlessly dolphins appear, gliding alongside boats as if they have always belonged there. Traditional dhow cruises also drift past isolated fishing villages accessible only by water, where life unfolds slowly and simply, far removed from the gloss and rush of city living.The turquoise waters around Musandam are not just beautiful; they are invitingly calm, making snorkelling and even beginner-friendly aquatic adventures very accessible. The sheltered fjords, like Khor Shem, offer crystal-clear conditions to float above vibrant coral and fish life, while kayaks let you explore hidden coves at your own pace.Meanwhile, traditional fishing villages dot the coastline, where life moves at its own rhythm. Some are accessible only by boat, offering a rare glimpse into coastal Omani culture untouched by the tourist trappings seen elsewhere.For travellers who want to linger, overnight dhow cruises offer an even richer perspective. These trips combine dolphin watching, kayaking, fishing and guided hikes and often include multi-course meals and gentle evenings anchored under starry skies. The experience lets visitors feel fully immersed in Musandam’s natural majesty — not just passing through it.With border crossings streamlined and travel buzz returning in early 2026, Khasab has emerged as a practical, scenic escape for UAE motorists and weekend adventurers. It is the kind of landscape that is easy to contactless book through tour operators that run day cruises and overnight stays, yet still rewarding for independent travellers who drive themselves across the border.Importantly, safety and tourism infrastructure, from boats to guides, means that even first-time visitors can enjoy this rugged beauty without stress. However, it is not just the dramatic fjords and dolphins. The peaceful natural environment and slower pace of life are big draws for anyone feeling the strain of urban living.Here’s how travellers are enhancing their Khasab trips -Khasab is not just another scenic destination, it is becoming a symbol of accessible adventure for Gulf residents. Just a few hours from the UAE’s glitzy cities, this calm and dramatic corner of Oman delivers fjord landscapes, wildlife encounters and a sense of peace that’s rare and memorable. Whether you are planning a weekend reset, a family outing or a deeper tropical exploration, Khasab brings nature and a touch of magic right to your doorstep.For UAE residents without a visa hassle, remember that Oman often allows UAE residents a visa-free entry if your residency card is valid, making spontaneous Khasab road trips even easier.","Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE.

Why expats can face rental trouble and legal visa issues without it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-ejari-in-dubai-why-expats-can-face-rental-trouble-and-legal-visa-issues-without-it/articleshow/127372648.cms,"New expats in Dubai face major hurdles if their rent isn’t Ejari-registered / AI Image

What is Ejari in Dubai?

What can go wrong without Ejari?

You cannot activate electricity or water through DEWA without an Ejari number.

Immigration authorities require it for your residency visa and for sponsoring family members.

and for sponsoring family members. Telecom providers like Etisalat and Du use it to verify your home address.

If your landlord tries to raise the rent illegally or evict you without notice, the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre (RDSC) will only hear your case if you have a registered Ejari.

Common mistakes among expats

If the landlord doesn’t register Ejari promptly, tenants can be stuck without utilities.

In shared homes or co-living setups, all occupants must be declared on Ejari; failure to do so can cause service issues or legal complications.

Some rentals are wrongly uploaded as “rented” in the system, blocking new Ejari registrations until previous records are cleared.





For thousands of expats arriving in Dubai this month, the hunt for the perfect home is the first major hurdle. However, a wave of sophisticated rental scams emerged in early 2026, targeting newcomers who are eager to secure housing quickly. Fraudsters are increasingly posing as legitimate agents or owners, offering luxury apartments at below-market rates to lure in unsuspecting tenants.These ""phantom landlords"" often present official-looking contracts but intentionally skip the most crucial step: Ejari registration. Without this government-verified document, a tenant has no legal standing, making them vulnerable to ""double-leasing"" (where the same unit is rented to multiple people) or vanishing ""agents"" who pocket the deposit and disappear.Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), designed to digitally record every tenancy contract. Until that registration is complete, a lease is effectively invisible to authorities and vendors.Ejari transforms a private agreement into a legally binding document recognized by the state. Beyond just proving you live there, this certificate is the ""master key"" required to unlock almost every essential service in the city.Without a valid Ejari, new expats find themselves stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, unable to complete basic tasks that are vital for settling into their new lives.George (not his real name) arrived in Dubai, found an apartment, signed a lease, paid his deposit, but skipped Ejari registration. Almost immediately, he ran into problems: DEWA (electricity/water authority) blocked his applications. Telecom companies wouldn’t connect broadband. Visa-related processes stalled. Verification of his address couldn’t proceed. Without the Ejari certificate, nothing worked.This isn’t rare, dozens of renters share similar experiences online where utilities, government services and official procedures are halted without Ejari. Registration isn’t just bureaucratic formality; it’s a legal gateway for life in Dubai.Key issues when Ejari is missing:One major confusion stems from the belief that a signed tenancy contract alone is enough. In fact, it’s not, only once a contract is uploaded and approved in Ejari is it formally recognised by authorities, courts, and service providers.Another frequent issue is who handles registration. By law, landlords are responsible, but in practice many tenants end up doing it themselves or paying agents or typing centres to process the paperwork. Without clarity on who manages Ejari, delays often occur.Here’s why that matters:The impact of following these regulations is peace of mind. By insisting on an Ejari-registered contract, expats ensure they are part of a regulated, transparent ecosystem. It prevents the heartbreak of ""rental ghosting"" and ensures that the thousands of dirhams spent on deposits and rent are protected by UAE law.As Dubai continues to grow, these digital safeguards are designed to make the city one of the most secure rental markets in the world, provided that tenants take that final, 30-minute step to make their contract official.","Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency. It is designed to digitally record every tenancy contract. Without Ejari, a tenant has no legal standing, making them vulnerable to ""double-leasing"" or vanishing ""agents""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127372944,imgsize-17620,width-400,resizemode-4/ejari-uae.jpg"
Did Russia really witness two suns? Inside the rare Sundog phenomenon that stunned Sakhalin residents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/did-russia-really-witness-two-suns-inside-the-rare-sundog-phenomenon-that-stunned-sakhalin-residents/articleshow/127460292.cms,"Source: Sakhalin News

Understanding Sundogs: When ‘two suns’ appeared in the sky over Russia



How Sundogs form : Science behind the illusion



Colours, shapes, and the physics behind sundogs



Origins of the term “Sundog”



Ideal conditions for observing sundogs



Historical and scientific significance







Residents of Russia's Sakhalin region were treated to a surreal sight recently: what looked like two suns rising side by side in the morning sky. The breathtaking view quickly went viral on social media, but it's not some sort of celestial aberration-it's an atmospheric optical phenomenon known as a sundog. Sundogs, also referred to as mock suns or parhelia, form when sunlight intersects with hexagonal ice crystals that hang suspended in the atmosphere, most commonly in high cirrus clouds or as diamond dust under extremely cold conditions. When the sun's rays pass through and are refracted by such crystals, they create bright, often colorful spots flanking the real Sun. Though unusual and striking for the ordinary observer, sundogs are well-known to scientists, offering a stunning demonstration of the ways in which light and ice can transform the sky for a time.Sundogs, which can also be called mock suns or parhelia, can be perceived as a series of colorful light phenomena appearing adjacent to the Sun. They can form at either side, or in some cases, at both, which is why sundogs can appear as though there is more than one Sun. The literal translation of “parhelia” is beside the Sun, which is a fitting description of sundogs. This is due to the two words from which this term is composed: the prefix ‘para’, which means beside, and ‘helios’, which means Sun.Sundogs, in fact, are associated with other optical effects such as the Sun halo and the Moon halo. In fact, all of these are associated with the refraction and diffraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere, which often align horizontally, producing a stunning and sometimes rare visual spectacle for observers.At the core of every sundog are always ice crystals in flat, hexagonal forms lofted high in the atmosphere, in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds at an altitude of anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 feet. However, in very cold climates, ice crystals also occur in ""diamond dust"" forms at lower altitudes when the temperature plummets below minus 30 degrees Celsius.Generally, the flat, plate-like crystals are aligned horizontally as they fall, with a little wobbling because of the currents of air. If the rays of sunlight enter the crystal at one face and then exit at the other at an angle of 60 degrees, then the rays are subject to refraction twice. This bends the rays at an angle of at least 22 degrees, accounting for the fact that sundogs are at the same height above the horizon as the Sun.Usually, if there is a concentration of light within a bright spot as opposed to a full circle, this is referred to as two sundogs, which can even take on the demeanor and allure referred to as “false suns” accompanying the true sun itself, as a result of this geometric wonder.The sundogs are not typically bright white, though often tinted with a pretty color that occurs as a result of a phenomenon involving the diffused light of the sun. The area closest to the sun often displays shades of red, which deepen to orange and then yellow, graduating into blue around the edges. There are different refractions of light with different wavelengths, with red light, having a larger wavelength, bending less than blue light to create a sideways rainbow effect of ROY G.BIV.The size and shape of sundogs can differ depending on their crystal size and wobbles. The size of crystals can be substantial, which causes them to wobble while they are in a fall, extending sundogs during this time. On other occasions, they can combine in parts of a complete 22° halo, which makes them less prominent but ethereal.The name 'sundog' for this phenomenon seems to have mythological, rather than scientific, origins. The old world viewed this as the brilliant spots being followed by the sun, as a dog is supposed to follow its owner. In Greek mythology, the sky god Zeus was said to travel across the sky with two dogs, and they were referred to as 'false suns,' signifying their glow.The technical term, ""parhelia,"" consists of ""para"" which means ""with"" and ""helio"" which means ""Sun,"" which literally describes a parhelion ""with the Sun."" The attractive and colorful term ""sundog"" eventually became a popular term to describe a parhelion.While sundogs can happen anywhere in the world at any time when the Sun is above the horizon, their visibility depends on specific conditions. A low Sun-almost during sunrise or sunset-is enhancing because light passes through ice crystals at a shallower angle, resulting in more pronounced bright spots.Cold weather also plays a significant role. In sub-zero temperatures, especially during winters at higher latitudes, there is a greater possibility of the atmosphere containing the hexagonal ice crystals required for producing sundogs. Thus, Sakhalin hosts ideal weather for watching this rare optical illusion in cold winters.Before the scientific theories of the refraction and dispersion of light, sundogs gave birth to several myths and legends. Sundogs have also been viewed as omens, the signs of the divine, or the companions of the Sun. But with experiments conducted by the pioneer, Sir Isaac Newton, to show us the exact reasons behind sundogs, we have an in-depth scientific knowledge.The recent display from Sakhalin serves as a noteworthy reminder that even ""ordinary"" sunlight, in its encounter with nature in certain forms, often results in ""extraordinary"" optical phenomena. One appreciates here the beauty in optical phenomena in nature in connection with their interrelation with light in its various forms.","Residents of Russia's Sakhalin region were treated to a surreal sight recently: what looked like two suns rising side by side in the morning sky.

The return of Pa’ashi as Tulare Lake floods California farmland again after 130 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-return-of-paashi-as-tulare-lake-floods-california-farmland-again-after-130-years/articleshow/127398539.cms,"The return of Pa’ashi as Tulare Lake floods California farmland again after 130 years (AI-generated)

Tulare Lake reappears after more than a century of drainage

The lake was drained and forgotten

The lake returned in 2023

What returned with the water

Why farming remains tied to the lakebed

How Indigenous knowledge frames the event

What Tulare Lake’s return leaves behind

.





In the spring of 2023, water spread across parts of California’s San Joaquin Valley, where crops and roads had stood for decades. Snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and repeated heavy storms pushed rivers beyond their channels. Fields disappeared under shallow waves. What appeared to many as sudden flooding was something older and less surprising to those familiar with the land. Tulare Lake, long treated as erased, was filling again. Known to the Yokuts people as Pa’ashi, meaning big water, the lake once dominated the valley floor. Its return covered roughly 94,000 acres, disrupting farming and infrastructure. It also reopened deeper questions about memory, land use, and how California manages water in a changing climate.Before large-scale water engineering, Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. At times it stretched close to 100 miles in length and 30 miles in width. Fed mainly by the Kern, Kings, Tule and Kaweah rivers, the lake expanded and shrank with seasonal flows.For the Yokuts people, Pa’ashi was not a fixed body of water but a living system. Its edges moved. Fish, birds and wetland plants followed the rhythms of wet and dry years.Settlers arriving in the nineteenth century struggled with this variability, often mistaking dry periods for permanence.By the late 1800s, canals, levees and dams redirected the rivers that fed Tulare Lake. The goal was agricultural expansion. Cotton, alfalfa and later almonds replaced wetlands. By 1898, the lakebed appeared dry, and many settlers declared the lake gone.That confidence proved fragile. Tulare Lake refilled several times in the early twentieth century. Major floods occurred in 1906, 1916, 1921 and again in the late 1930s. Each time, farms planted on the lakebed were inundated. Each time the water eventually receded, and memory faded again.The winter of 2022 and 2023 brought record snowfall to the Sierra Nevada. Spring warming released that water quickly. At the same time, a series of atmospheric river storms added rain across the valley. Levees and diversion systems designed for farming could not fully contain the flow. Water moved toward its lowest point, the historic lakebed. Over weeks, Tulare Lake reformed, reaching a size comparable to Lake Tahoe. Roads, dairies and orchards were left surrounded by shallow water.The lake brought more than flooding. Birds arrived in large numbers. Wading species spread across the new shoreline. Fish appeared in channels and pools. Local residents reported cooler breezes and higher humidity near the water.These changes echoed historical accounts. Early settlers wrote of winds driven by the open lake surface and of wildlife returning as soon as water settled. The reappearance of these patterns suggests that the valley floor still responds quickly when water is allowed to spread.Much of the land now underwater has been farmed intensively for generations. The soil is fertile. Infrastructure is already in place. From an economic view, abandoning the area feels impossible. Yet the repeated flooding history shows a pattern. When wet years arrive, the lake returns. When dry years follow, planting resumes. Each cycle brings losses. Climate change adds uncertainty, increasing the chances of extreme swings between drought and flood.For the Yokuts, Pa’ashi was never erased. The lake’s name and stories preserved its presence even when maps did not. From this view, the 2023 flooding was not a disaster alone but a reminder of an older truth about the land. This perspective challenges the idea that control over water is complete or permanent. It also raises questions about whose knowledge shaped California’s development and whose was ignored.As waters slowly recede, some fields may be replanted. Others may remain too damaged. Legal and political debates continue over responsibility, compensation and future planning. The lake does not offer a conclusion. It leaves behind wet soil, altered air, and a visible outline of something that was meant to be forgotten. Pa’ashi returned without ceremony. It may not stay. History suggests it will not be the last time.This article is based on the feature of OPEN RIVERS","Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.

Turkey’s Cappadocia region contains dozens of fully developed underground cities

Why people chose to live beneath the surface

Discovered beneath Nevşehir Castle

How researchers are estimating its true size

What daily life looked like below ground

Cappadocia became a refuge zone

What the future holds for these underground cities





Beneath familiar landscapes, traces of everyday life sometimes survive in places few expect to find them. Across parts of the world, tunnels, chambers and stairways cut into rock show that living underground was once a practical choice, not a novelty. These spaces were not temporary shelters or isolated caves. They were planned environments where people cooked, stored food, worshipped and waited out danger. Many underground passages promoted today as lost cities are little more than mines or short refuges. A smaller number, however, were full habitations used over generations. In central Turkey, one This discovery is reshaping our understanding of how entire communities adapted to conflict and climate. Communities adapted to conflict and climate. The remains lie beneath modern streets, largely unseen, yet carefully organised for life below ground.The most extensive underground settlements known today are found in the Cappadocia region of central Turkey. The area is shaped by thick layers of volcanic ash rock, known as tuff, which is soft enough to carve but strong enough to hold its form. Over centuries, local communities cut rooms, corridors and shafts deep into this material.According to National Geographic , archaeologists have documented at least 36 underground cities across Cappadocia. Some were small refuges. Others expanded into multi-level complexes. The best known, Derinkuyu, reaches around 85 metres below the surface and includes living quarters, kitchens, storage rooms, chapels and ventilation shafts.Life underground offered protection. Cappadocia sat at the crossroads of empires, religions and trade routes. Invasions were frequent. When danger approached, residents could retreat below ground, seal entrances with heavy stone doors and survive for weeks or months.The underground cities were designed for this purpose. Narrow tunnels limited movement. Air shafts supplied fresh oxygen. Water channels connected to wells. Livestock were sometimes kept inside, adding warmth and food but also requiring careful ventilation.In 2013, a housing development near a Byzantine-era castle in Nevşehir revealed hidden entrances to a previously unknown underground settlement. Construction stopped, and archaeologists were called in. What they found was far larger than expected.Beneath the hilltop castle lay a network of rooms and tunnels stretching across several kilometres. Early surveys suggest the complex may rival or even exceed Derinkuyu in size. Artefacts, including ceramics, stone crosses and grinding tools, point to long-term use from Byzantine times through the Ottoman period.Geophysicists from Nevşehir University conducted detailed surveys using resistivity and seismic imaging. These methods allow scientists to map voids in rock without excavation. According to dozens of measurements, the underground city covers nearly five million square feet. Some corridors may reach depths of more than 110 metres. If confirmed, this would make the site one of the deepest known underground habitations. Researchers caution that much remains unexplored, and fragile rock conditions slow progress.The layout suggests a self-sustaining community. There are signs of kitchens, wineries and linseed presses used to produce oil for lamps. Chapels indicate regular religious practice. Storage rooms would have held grain and dried foods.Living underground was likely dark and crowded. Yet these spaces were carefully planned, not improvised. Over time, residents refined the design, expanding rooms and improving airflow. The cities were not hidden forever. People returned to the surface when threats passed.Cappadocia adopted Christianity early. By the fourth century, its bishops held influence within the Byzantine Empire. This religious identity made the region a target during centuries of conflict over Anatolia. Muslim forces arrived in the late eighth century. Later came the Seljuk Turks, followed by Ottoman rule. Through each shift, underground cities provided continuity. They allowed communities to endure without constant rebuilding or flight.Local authorities see cultural and economic potential. Plans include opening sections of the Nevşehir site to the public and developing museums and walking routes. There are also proposals for above-ground tourism facilities. Archaeologists remain cautious. Excavation carries risks, as the soft tuff can collapse. Work continues slowly, clearing rubble and documenting spaces as they emerge. Each chamber adds another detail to a long, quiet record of people who once lived beneath the earth, not as legend, but as routine.","Turkey’s Cappadocia region contains dozens of fully developed underground cities.

Evidence of ancient microbial activity found in Namibian Desert rock formations

Erosion alone does not fit

Signs pointing toward biological activity

What kind of organisms could do this

Deserts hide unexpected histories

This matters for Earth and beyond





In some of the driest parts of southern Africa, rock faces hold quiet records of much older worlds. Marble and limestone formations, shaped long before today’s deserts formed, often preserve signs of shifting climates and slow geological stress. Most markings fit within known patterns of erosion or mineral change. But in scattered outcrops across Namibia and parts of the Arabian Peninsula, researchers have noticed something that sits uneasily with those explanations. Fine, repeated tunnels run through the stone in tight, parallel lines. They follow fractures but extend beyond them, cutting into solid rock. Their shape is controlled, their spacing consistent. These features appear old, inactive, and difficult to explain. They point to processes that do not operate in these environments today.The structures have been identified in desert regions of Namibia, Oman and Saudi Arabia. In Namibia, they are found in Neoproterozoic marble exposed along river valleys and plateaus far from the coast. Similar features occur in limestone formations across the Arabian Peninsula.The common factor is geological stability. These rocks have not been heavily deformed for hundreds of millions of years.The tunnels appear as bands rather than isolated holes. Each band can extend for metres, sometimes following a fracture before fading back into intact stone. Individual tunnels are small, less than a millimetre wide and only a few centimetres long. They are always aligned. They do not cross or branch randomly. This regularity is one of the details that drew attention in the field.At first glance, weathering seems an obvious explanation. Desert rocks often show pitting, flaking and chemical alteration. But these tunnels behave differently. They cut across mineral layers without disturbing them. In many cases, the original colour banding of the marble remains visible along the tunnel walls, suggesting material was removed rather than replaced.Typical karst processes produce irregular cavities and widened fractures. Crystallisation leaves angular patterns. Tectonic stress creates breaks, not fine parallel tubes. None of these processes produce tightly packed, evenly spaced borings that stop at similar depths. The geometry looks controlled, not accidental.Researchers of the article “Subfossil Fracture-Related Euendolithic Micro-burrows in Marble and Limestone” did a closer analysis that adds weight to a biological explanation. The tunnels are often filled with fine white calcite that contrasts with the host rock. Chemical testing shows that this infill is depleted in several elements compared to the surrounding stone. Along the tunnel edges, researchers have detected thin rims enriched in phosphorus and sulphur.Microscopy and spectroscopy reveal traces of degraded biological material. Carbon isotope values also fall within ranges associated with life. DNA and proteins are no longer present, which is not surprising given the age. But the chemical fingerprints remain. Together, they suggest that microorganisms once bored into the rock while alive, then left behind altered mineral chemistry when conditions changed.Endolithic microbes are known to live inside rocks in extreme environments. Some occupy cracks. Others actively dissolve minerals to create space. These organisms are found in places such as Antarctica and the Atacama Desert, where surface conditions are harsh but rock interiors offer protection.The newly described tunnels resemble endolithic activity, where microbes bore directly into carbonate rock. What's unusual is the scale and organisation. The tunnels form long bands with consistent orientation, suggesting a shared growth direction or environmental trigger. No known modern organism produces exactly this pattern. It remains unclear whether the responsible microbes still exist or are extinct.Today, the regions where these tunnels occur are hyperarid. Rain is rare. Biological activity is limited. Yet the tunnels imply conditions that once allowed sustained microbial life within the rock. That does not require lush landscapes, but it does suggest a different balance of moisture and chemistry.Because deserts preserve surfaces with little disturbance, they can lock in evidence that would be erased elsewhere. Features formed deep inside rock masses can later be exposed by erosion, appearing almost out of place in the modern climate.Carbonate rocks hold most of Earth’s carbon. Understanding how life interacts with them matters for models of the global carbon cycle. Even small biological effects, repeated over large areas and long times, can shift carbon between solid rock and the environment.These findings also matter beyond Earth. Similar carbonate rocks exist on Mars. If microbes once lived inside them, their traces might look subtle and unfamiliar. The tunnels in Namibia and Arabia show that life can leave marks that do not resemble fossils in the usual sense.The bands end quietly in fractures. There is no clear start or finish. Just traces, cut into stone, waiting to be noticed.","Mysterious ancient life found in tunnels of Africa and Arabia leave scientists searching for answers.

Evidence of reuse under later rulers

What the discovery adds to Egyptian history





Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years, offering a detailed look at daily life during one of ancient Egypt’s most powerful periods. The settlement was built under Pharaoh Amenhotep III and later inherited by his son Akhenaten, whose radical religious reforms reshaped Egyptian history. Found within the ancient capital of Thebes, the site includes homes, workshops, administrative buildings and burial areas, many preserved to an unusual degree. Officials described it in 2021 as the “lost golden city of Luxor”, pointing to its scale and condition rather than any single monument. The discovery adds context to a period marked by wealth, upheaval and a sudden break with long-held tradition. Artefacts, streets, ovens, seals, and walls reveal economic organisation, craft production, family routines, and governance structures fragmented across Egypt’s record. National Geographic mentions excavation revealed a dense urban area enclosed by mudbrick walls that in places rise to around nine feet. Inside, rooms were filled with everyday objects left where they were last used.Pottery vessels, tools and food remains suggested the city was active and organised, rather than ceremonial alone. Some buildings appeared domestic, while others showed signs of planning and record keeping. Archaeologists also identified streets and defined neighbourhoods, hinting at a carefully managed royal settlement rather than a temporary camp.Amenhotep III ruled during the 18th dynasty, a time associated with strong diplomacy, vast resources and ambitious building projects. His court oversaw temples, statues and palaces across Egypt. The newly uncovered city appears to have supported this activity, functioning as an industrial and administrative centre linked to the wider capital at Thebes. Items related to metal and glass production were found, alongside evidence of large scale food preparation. This supports long-held views of Amenhotep III’s reign as one of stability and excess, built on a complex labour system.After Amenhotep III’s death, his son Akhenaten took a sharply different path. He rejected Egypt’s traditional gods in favour of a single sun deity, Aten, and moved the royal court to a new city called Akhetaten, now known as Amarna. The discovery near Luxor suggests Akhenaten inherited a functioning and productive city, raising questions about why he chose to abandon Thebes altogether. Archaeologists believe the settlement was active during the early years of his rule, before being partially left behind as power shifted north.One of the most striking aspects of the site was the amount of material linked to ordinary labour. A bakery and kitchen complex was identified, with large ovens and storage jars. Other areas showed traces of workshops used for jewellery, metal tools and decorative objects. These findings help balance the historical record, which often focuses on kings and temples rather than workers and craftspeople. The layout suggests people lived close to where they worked, within a tightly organised royal economy.The city did not vanish immediately after Akhenaten’s reign. Archaeologists found signs that it was reused during the time of Tutankhamun, who restored traditional religion and ruled from Memphis rather than Thebes or Amarna. Objects from later periods suggested continued, though reduced, activity. Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamun, may also have made use of the site. Layers of occupation showed that parts of the settlement remained in use well into the Coptic Byzantine era before finally being covered by sand.The importance of the site lies less in spectacle and more in detail. Its preservation allows archaeologists to study how a royal city functioned at ground level. It also provides context for one of Egypt’s most dramatic political and religious shifts. Rather than viewing Akhenaten’s reforms in isolation, researchers can now place them against the backdrop of a thriving urban centre he chose to leave behind. The city near Luxor does not answer every question, but it quietly fills gaps in a long and complicated story.","Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years.

On-stream Notepad mistake leads to swift Twitch and Kick platform action





Popular streamer Lacari is in hot water as he has been suspended by Twitch and permanently banned on Kick after his disturbing on-stream incident shocked viewers and sparked an outpouring of outrage online. The fiasco came about when, during a live stream, he opened Microsoft Notepad, not realizing that today's version opens previous sessions and what came up on screen was, basically, links in relation to illegal and highly sensitive material, including CSAM, bestiality, and incest-related content.The clips of his stream ended up circulating on social media platforms, leading to strong opinions from people both on his side and those against him. While trying to downplay criticism for his actions during his stream, Lacari continued with his stream. Twitch subsequently confirmed a suspension for seven days and Kick immediately banned him permanently for violating its rules on illegal material.That incident revealed a very controversial feature in modern versions of Microsoft Notepad that saves previous sessions by default. When Lacari opened the app live, the saved file appeared instantly.Viewers also noticed that some of the text in the file appeared highlighted, which many claimed was proof the links recently received interaction. The detail furthered skepticism from many regarding Lacari's initial explanation, the links auto-downloaded without his knowledge.As criticism grew, Lacari issued a public apology on X, acknowledging that his response during the stream was wrong. He admitted that trying to minimize the seriousness of the situation was deceptive and said he deeply regretted his actions. In his statement, Lacari stressed that he has never consumed CSAM and does not support it in any form, while also admitting to long-term struggles with porn addiction.In an effort to take accountability, Lacari announced that he had entered a 30-day porn addiction recovery program that includes professional therapy and treatment. He also confirmed an indefinite hiatus from live streaming to focus fully on recovery and personal improvement. According to him, this break is meant to help ensure he can return as a more responsible and positive presence online, if at all.The difference in punishment between platforms has also raised questions. While Kick opted for a permanent ban, Twitch’s seven-day suspension sparked debate about how streaming platforms handle cases involving extremely serious content.

Is it really going to rain?

Road safety alerts

Stay Updated: Monitor the NCM’s ""Red"" and ""Yellow"" alerts before heading out on long drives.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter. For many, the arrival of clouds and light drizzle is a celebrated event, signaling the peak of ""Karak tea season"" and outdoor gatherings.While the seas remain generally calm to moderate in the Arabian Gulf, the refreshing winds, reaching up to 35 km/h, add a crisp feel to the air.Whether the rain hits your neighborhood or just teases from the clouds, it’s a time to wrap up warm and enjoy the rarest of desert sights: a rainy day in the Emirates.","The UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.

UAE child digital safety law 2026

Ensuring children only use apps and games suited for their specific age group.



Utilizing parental control tools to block access to adult or harmful materials.



Preventing children from sharing sensitive personal data or the private information of others.



Reporting any digital threats or grooming attempts to the relevant UAE authorities immediately.

Fines for neglect



Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences.

Reality behind the snow





Imagine waking up, looking out your window in Dubai, and seeing the Burj Khalifa draped in a blanket of fresh, powdery snow. That was the dream His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza), shared with his millions of followers this Thursday.His Highness, who is basically Dubai’s unofficial ""Chief Storyteller,"" posted a viral image that looked like a scene straight out of a Disney movie, except the ""Castle"" was a world-famous skyscraper.While the photo was a creative ""what if,"" it perfectly captured the mood of a city currently obsessed with the cold. The caption by His Highness, “how the weather will feel tomorrow,” was a cheeky nod to the freezing winds currently whistling through the city's glass towers.While we aren't exactly skiing down Sheikh Zayed Road just yet, the ""Real Feel"" temperature in the UAE is getting pretty close to the vision shared by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan. This week, the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) reported that the mercury hit a bone-chilling 0.2°C on Jebel Jais.For a city built for 45°C summers, this cold snap has changed the way we live:The viral image itself is a masterclass in digital art, likely utilizing AI or high-level editing to show the world what Dubai would look like as a Nordic capital.It’s part of a larger trend where His Highness Sheikh Hamdan uses his platform to highlight the beauty and seasonal shifts of the city in a fun, relatable way.However, the weather scientists at the NCM remind us that while the photo is a fantasy, the Siberian High Pressure system is very real. These winds are pushing clouds across the country and keeping the sun from heating up the desert floor, making this one of the most sustained cold periods the UAE has seen in years. The NCM has even issued warnings about fierce winds, reminding everyone that this winter ""nip"" has some real power behind it.There is something about a cold morning that brings a community together. Whether it’s sharing a viral post from His Highness Sheikh Hamdan or huddling together at a weekend desert camp, the ""Fazza Snow"" photo has become a cultural moment. It reminds us that even in a city of sand and sun, there’s always room for a little winter magic. So, go ahead, wear that heavy coat you bought for your last trip to London. This week, you actually need it.","His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza) posted a photo of the Burj Khalifa covered in snow.

"Abu Dhabi Dar​b toll scam alert: Fraudsters sending fake pending fees messages, what UAE residents must know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-darb-toll-scam-alert-fraudsters-sending-fake-pending-fees-messages-what-uae-residents-must-know/articleshow/126978446.cms,"UAE Darb Toll Scam Alert: Drivers Warned of Fake SMS Messages

What are UAE drivers seeing? Fake “DARB alerts”



A supposed payment link with a web URL that looks official at first glance

A prompt to “Reply Y” to open a payment portal

A claimed overdue toll amount

The sender phone number was not from a UAE mobile network

The links did not use official government or Q Mobility domains

Recipients often reported they had no actual pending tolls

Official advice: Trust only Q Mobility’s approved channels



The official DARB App

The Darb website: darb.qmobility.ae

Approved government platforms such as TAMM

Any message that arrives from a random phone number, especially from an international code, should be treated as suspicious.

Why this UAE toll scam is on the rise



كن حذراً من رسائل الاحتيال التي تدّعي أنها من كيو موبيليتي

تأكد دائماً من أن الرابط في الرسالة النصية صحيح وأن الرسالة مرسلة من الحساب الرسمي ""كيو موبيليتي"".

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts.

Special medical considerations for Ramadan 2026



Bottom line: Opt for a balanced, informed approach this Ramadan 2026







As Ramadan 2026 nears, millions around the world are preparing not only spiritually but physically for a month of dawn-to-sunset fasting. While fasting is a beloved religious observance, health experts emphasise that preparation and smart nutrition are crucial to maintaining wellbeing throughout the month. Combining insights from local doctors and reputable global health organisations, here is a trusted guide to help you fast safely and comfortably.Adequate hydration is one of the most important components of a successful fast. The World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office specifically recommends drinking plenty of water (at least around 10 glasses) and eating hydrating foods such as soups and fresh fruits like watermelon and salads during non-fasting hours to compensate for fluids lost during the day. They also advise avoiding caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola because caffeine increases urination and can lead to dehydration.Cornell Health, the health and wellbeing service of Cornell University, echoes this and adds that one should drink fluids at regular intervals through the night and avoid consuming too much at once, as over-hydration in one go can dilute electrolytes.Skipping the pre-dawn meal (suhoor) can make fasting significantly harder.Nutrition experts from Cornell Health advise that suhoor should include a mix of whole grains, protein, healthy fats and fruits or vegetables to help sustain energy and keep blood sugar stable throughout the long fast. Examples include whole-grain cereals or toast with eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or brown rice with vegetables.The WHO also recommends that suhoor be light but nutritious, particularly for groups who may be more vulnerable during fasting such as elderly adults, adolescents, pregnant or nursing women.Both WHO and international dietary guides emphasise the benefits of starting iftar (the evening meal that breaks the fast) with water and dates, a longstanding tradition rooted in health as well as faith. Dates provide natural sugars and a small energy boost while water immediately begins rehydrating the body after prolonged abstinence.This approach is supported by general Ramadan nutrition advice from organisations such as Fraser Health in Canada, which notes that dates and low-fat milk are a healthy way to break the fast and can help prevent abrupt blood sugar fluctuations that contribute to fatigue.Healthline, a respected medical and nutrition information site, recommends leaning into whole foods rich in fiber, lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates during iftar to replenish nutrients lost during the day and provide lasting energy through the night and into the next fast. Examples include vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, legumes and dairy.Their registered dietitians also emphasise moderation, eating mindfully at iftar and avoiding heavy, sugary, or high-fat foods that can cause indigestion and fatigue. Starting with water and a small date or fruit before main dishes helps control appetite and prevent overeating.Several health authorities recommend reducing caffeine intake in the week leading up to Ramadan. Research and expert advice from wellness organisations suggest that sudden withdrawal from habitual caffeine can lead to headaches and fatigue, symptoms many people misattribute to fasting itself. Gradually tapering coffee and tea before Ramadan can help your body avoid these issues once fasting begins.Moreover, WHO guidance clearly states avoiding caffeine during suhoor and non-fasting periods because it increases urine output and can exacerbate dehydration, something you want to minimise before long fasting hours.WHO and other health organisations encourage a balanced diet throughout Ramadan, composed of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and sufficient fluids, while limiting deep-fried, processed or high-sugar foods that contribute little nutrition and can lead to discomfort or weight gain.This aligns with Cornell Health’s advice on maintaining good nutrition: including vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins at both suhoor and iftar to help manage hunger, energy levels, and overall health during the fast.While Ramadan is not usually a time for intense workouts during fasting hours, light movement and gentle exercise in the evening, such as walking or stretching, can support digestion and circulation, according to health advisors. Framing this within a balanced lifestyle helps preserve energy without risking dehydration or exhaustion.Sleep hygiene is also important because altered timetables can disrupt normal sleep cycles during Ramadan. Experts advise aiming for adequate rest (7–8 hours if possible) by incorporating naps and consistent sleeping schedules into your routine, which supports physical recovery throughout the fasting month.International health bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and dietetics professionals often emphasise that people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or those on specific medications should consult a healthcare provider before fasting. Adjustments to meal timing, medication schedules and monitoring plans ensure safety and prevent complications.This is particularly relevant for individuals whose medical treatments require food or water intake at specific times and cannot be adjusted without professional supervision.Preparing your body for Ramadan fasting is not just about abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours. It is about planning smartly, hydrating fully, eating nutrient-dense meals and respecting your body’s needs. Strategies backed by the World Health Organization, Cornell Health and other recognised health authorities affirm that with proper preparation, most people can experience a safe, comfortable and fulfilling Ramadan.By following these evidence-based tips, from hydration and meal composition to rest and medical consultation, you can approach the holy month with both spiritual intention and physical wellbeing.",Ramadan 2026: Are You Ready to Fast Safely?

— Dubai Media Office (@DXBMediaOffice) January 18, 2026

In January 2026, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) unveiled a milestone in sustainable transport: the arrival and imminent deployment of Zhongtong electric buses capable of operating up to 280 kilometres on a single charge on urban routes. This development, part of a 735-bus procurement plan that includes 40 electric units, marks one of the largest and most advanced electric public-bus deployments in the UAE to date. It reflects Dubai’s accelerating commitment to zero-emission mobility and its broader climate strategy for 2050.At the heart of this initiative is the Zhongtong electric bus, a 12-metre, custom-designed vehicle tailored to Dubai’s climate and operational conditions. Powered by a 434 kWh battery and supported by 360 kW ABB fast chargers, the buses can cover daily routes without having to return to depots for recharging. That 280 km range on a single charge is a major leap for electric public buses in the region, where high temperatures and intensive daily service patterns have previously limited operational efficiency.This deployment makes Dubai one of the first Gulf cities to run electric buses at this scale, with enhanced range and performance that can sustain an entire day’s worth of urban service before needing replenishment.The Zhongtong buses are not a standalone effort. They form a part of the RTA’s Zero-Emission Public Transport Strategy 2050, which aims to transform Dubai’s transit network into a fully zero-emission system by mid-century. Under this strategy, the goal is for all public buses, taxis and limousine services to run on electric or hydrogen power by 2050, supporting wider national climate objectives, including climate neutrality and carbon-footprint reduction.","The Zhongtong electric bus is the first of its type to be operated on Dubai’s urban routes.
