New Austrian tunnelling method achieves milestone breakthrough in BKC-Shillphata undersea tunnel project,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-austrian-tunnelling-method-achieves-milestone-breakthrough-in-bkc-shillphata-undersea-tunnel-project/articleshow/124015027.cms,"New Austrian tunnelling method achieves milestone breakthrough in BKC-Shillphata undersea tunnel project

In a significant milestone for the ambitious undersea tunnel project between BKC and Shillphata, the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) has successfully achieved a breakthrough for its 5 km tunnel stretch.This critical section, which runs 4.881 km, notably includes a challenging 7 km segment beneath the Thane Creek. Tunneling commenced in May 2024, and on July 9, engineers celebrated the first breakthrough for a continuous 2.7 km section, connecting the ADIT to the Savali shaft.With this achievement, excavation is now complete between the Savali shaft and the tunnel portal at Shillphata, paving the way for the tunnel's integration with the viaduct segment of the Mega Airport High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) project. To accelerate the process, an Additional Driven Intermediate Tunnel (ADIT) was constructed, enabling simultaneous excavation from both Ghansoli and Shilphata sides.The remaining 16 km of tunnelling will be executed using Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs). The tunnel will be a single tube tunnel of 13.1 meters in diameter to accommodate twin track for both up and down lines.Comprehensive safety measures have been implemented at the site, including ground settlement markers, piezometers, inclinometers, and strain gauges to ensure safe and controlled tunnelling activities without disturbing nearby structures.Proper arrangements were made to restrict access to the tunnel construction sites, preventing unauthorised entry and ensuring the safety of workers within the sensitive and complex construction environment. Provisions were made for pumping fresh air inside the tunnel for the construction workers.India's first 508 km long Bullet Train corridor, connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad, is making significant progress. Out of the total length of 508 km, 321 km of viaduct and 398 km of pier work have already been completed.Additionally, all 17 river bridges and 9 steel bridges have been finished. To enhance noise control, more than 400,000 noise barriers have been installed along a 206 km stretch. The construction of 206 km of track bed has also been completed, alongside the installation of over 2,000 OHE masts, which cover approximately 48 km of the mainline viaduct.Currently, excavation work is ongoing for 7 mountain tunnels located in Palghar district.Meanwhile, the superstructure work on all stations in Gujarat is at an advanced stage, and construction has commenced on all three elevated stations, with base slab casting in progress at the Mumbai underground station in Maharashtra.","Austrian tunnelling method achieves milestone breakthrough in BKC-Shillphata undersea tunnel project.

This groundbreaking vehicle, designed from the ground up for autonomy and privacy, represents a major leap in personal mobility, combining advanced AI, industry-leading safety, and innovative features to empower individual ownership in a way no other autonomous car has before. Customer deliveries are projected in H2 2026.Tensor, a Silicon Valley-based AI company, is introducing its Robocar publicly in the Middle East for the first time at the Dubai World Congress for Self-Driving Transport, held on September 24–25, 2025, at the Dubai World Trade Centre. The event, organized by the Roads & Transport Authority (RTA) – Government of Dubai, expects over 3,000 attendees and more than 85 speakers focused on AI-powered mobility, smart infrastructure, safety and sustainable transport.For Tensor this is strategic and symbolic. The company calls the Robocar a category-defining product and says the Dubai showcase marks a defining milestone in its mission to “transform transportation.” As Amy Luca, Tensor’s Chief Marketing Officer, puts it:Tensor is not a converted EV: it is engineered from the ground up for autonomy.The design and systems were built on “a decade of proprietary engineering” and native support for autonomy rather than being an add-on. Customer deliveries are expected in the second half of 2026, with Dubai positioned at the forefront of this new mobility era.Tensor states the Robocar is purpose-built for SAE Level 4 autonomy and engineered to meet or exceed a wide range of global safety standards: FMVSS, UN/ECE, and GSO standards including MOIAT conformity. Tensor aims for top third-party ratings such as IIHS Top Safety Pick+, Euro NCAP and US NCAP 5-Star.To eliminate single points of failure, the vehicle’s design layers redundancy across:Privacy is built in, not bolted on. Tensor’s stated principles:Founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 and headquartered in San Jose, Tensor is a leading American AI company specializing in agentic products designed to empower individual users. With additional offices in Barcelona, Singapore, and Dubai, Tensor focuses on pioneering autonomous vehicle technology built from the ground up for private ownership at scale.Tensor’s ecosystem includes prominent partners such as Nvidia (providing an onboard supercomputer delivering 8,000 trillion operations per second), Sony (17-megapixel automotive-grade cameras), VinFast (advanced manufacturing), Oracle (cloud infrastructure), and Marsh, which supports the world’s first insurance policy tailored for Robocars.SAE defines six levels of vehicle automation fromto.

Why DeepSeek and its model made waves in US tech industry



iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Series Mega Unboxing





Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals. After launch, the DeepSeek R1 model stood out for its cost-efficient development and its open-source nature, offering unlimited free usage to a wide audience. Its emergence as a direct competitor to models from industry leaders such as OpenAI Google , and Anthropic has brought new scrutiny to the financial investments required for AI development.According to a report by Reuters, DeepSeek revealed that the company spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train its R1 model. This figure was published in a peer-reviewed article in the academic journal Nature.The company’s disclosure may reignite a debate in the tech industry over why US giants are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train large language models (LLMs).DeepSeek's release of what it claimed were lower-cost AI systems in January caused investors to sell off tech stocks, as they worried the new models could threaten the dominance of companies like Nvidia. The update, which is the first cost estimate the Hangzhou-based company has released for its R1 model, appeared in a paper co-authored by its founder, Liang Wenfeng.The paper specified that the reasoning-focused model was trained using 512 Nvidia H800 chips.By comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2023 that ""foundational model training"" had cost ""much more"" than $100 million, though his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported.Some of DeepSeek's previous claims about its development costs and technology have been questioned by US companies and officials. The company’s use of H800 chips comes after the US in October 2022 made it illegal for Nvidia to export its more powerful H100 and A100 AI chips to China.In a supplementary document to the Nature article, DeepSeek acknowledged for the first time that it does own A100 chips and used them in the “preparatory stages of development” for R1.US officials claimed in June that DeepSeek had access to “large volumes” of H100 chips procured after export controls were in place, a claim Nvidia has denied, stating that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 chips.","Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals.

Meta introduces Celeste: Subtle AR display, wristband control, and luxury design hints



Meta’s Celeste AR glasses: Premium cost, niche audience, strategic launch



Meta faces child safety controversies while pushing forward with AR and AI



Meta aims to grow AR market by empowering developers with Celeste

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and niche markets, rather than appealing to a broad mainstream consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky, heavier than expected, and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers, encouraging innovative apps, and paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event.

LONDON: A new dark web portal to recruit spies for Britain's foreign intelligence agency, MI6, from countries such as Russia will be launched in the UK on Friday. It is the first time MI6 has established its official presence on the dark web to reach new recruits and tackle hostile actors seeking to undermine UK security.MI6's new secure messaging platform - Silent Courier - enables anyone anywhere in the world with access to sensitive information relating to terrorism or hostile intelligence activity to securely contact the UK and offer their services.Instructions on how to access the portal will be publicly available on MI6's verified YouTube channel on Friday. MI6 advises individuals accessing its portal to use trustworthy VPNs and devices not linked to themselves, to mitigate risks which exist in some countries. The aim is to make it easier for MI6 to recruit agents in Russia and other countries online.UK foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""As the world changes, and the threats we're facing multiply, we must ensure the UK is always one step ahead of our adversaries. Our world class intelligence agencies are at the coalface of this challenge, working behind the scenes to keep British people safe.""","New dark web portal to recruit spies for Britain's foreign intelligence agency, MI6, will be launched in the UK on Friday.

Rome's airport opens luxurious dog hotel with pampering services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/romes-airport-opens-luxurious-dog-hotel-with-pampering-services/articleshow/124033139.cms,"A dog named Zoe, runs out from one of the rooms of the Dog Relais, a hotel for dogs at Rome's Fiumicino International Airport (AP photo)





FIUMICINO: Dog owners often face a dilemma before traveling: leave your beloved pet with a sitter or at a kennel? Both require quite some planning and logistics, which can be stressful and time-consuming for fur parents.Rome's Fiumicino International Airport has sought to streamline the process by opening one of the first on-site hotels at a major European airport, following a similar initiative in Frankfurt. Dog Relais' workers even retrieve pups from the terminal so travelers can proceed straight to their flight.""This project is fitting into a strategy to provide a very immersive experience to passengers,"" said Marilena Blasi, chief commercial officer at Aeroporti di Roma, the company that manages Italian capital's two airports. ""In this case, we provide services to dogs and the owners of the dogs.""Basic rooms at the dog hotel cost about €40 ($47) and feature temperature-controlled floors and private gardens. More timid or solitary dogs can be placed in kennels at the edge of the facility, where they interact with staff rather than other dogs in the common grass pens. At night, ambient music that has a frequency with a low, soft tone - 432 hertz - designed for relaxation is piped in through the rooms' speakers.There are optional extras that range from the usual grooming, bathing and cleaning teeth services, to the more indulgent, such as aromatherapy with lavender or peppermint scents to help induce calm, or arnica cream rubbed into aching muscles and joints.Owners unsatisfied with standard-issue webcams for checking in on their canines from afar can spring for a €60 (about $70) premium room equipped with a screen for round-the-clock videocalls. They can even pamper their pet by tossing a treat via an application connected to a dispenser.The facility not only provides its services to travelers, but also to dog owners who need daycare.Working in human resources for Aeroporti di Roma, Alessandra Morelli regularly leaves her 2-year-old, chocolate-colored Labrador Retriever there.""Since I've been able to bring Nina to this dog hotel, my life, and the balance between my personal and professional life have changed because it allows me to enjoy my working day and my personal travels in total peace and tranquility,"" said Morelli, 47.Dario Chiassarini, 32, said he started bringing his Rottweiler puppy, Athena, to Dog Relais for training, another service on offer, because it's clean, well-organized and its location was easily accessible. And he said he plans to check his beloved pup into the hotel whenever he and his girlfriend need to travel.""We will rely on them without hesitation and without doubt - both because we got to know the people who work here, which for us is essential, and because of the love they have for animals and the peace of mind of knowing who we are entrusting Athena to,"" said Chiassarini, who works in car sales. ""It is certainly a service that, if we should need it, we will make use of.""The dog hotel has proved popular so far. All 40 rooms were occupied in August, when Italians take their customary summer vacation and millions of passengers come through Fiumicino. Occupancy averaged almost 2/3 since doors opened in May, said Blasi.The same month the dog hotel opened, Italy's commercial aviation authority changed rules to allow large dogs to fly inside plane cabins for domestic flights, provided they are inside secured crates. The first such flight will take off on Sept. 23, according to transport minister, Matteo Salvini.Salvini admits that while many are happy with having their pups on the plane, others may feel annoyed. However, at a pet conference on Sept. 16, he said: ""We always have to use judgment, but ... for me it's a source of pride, as well as a step forward from the point of view of civilization.""","Rome's Fiumicino International Airport has sought to streamline the process by opening one of the first on-site hotels at a major European airport.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy.

To reduce administrative delays and prevent duplicate applications, Kuwait ’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a new visa pre-verification feature for domestic workers (Visa 20) via the Sahel app. The move is part of a broader push to digitize services, enhance transparency, and streamline regulatory compliance in labor and immigration processes.The Ministry of Interior recently launched a new tool on the unified Sahel application, enabling users to verify whether a visa has already been issued for a particular domestic worker before they proceed with recruitment. This is aimed at avoiding common errors such as duplicate applications, which often result in delays or outright rejections.The feature focuses specifically on the Visa 20 category, which applies to foreign nationals working as domestic staff — including maids, drivers, and household helpers, under the sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen or resident.By making this verification step available through Sahel, the Ministry aims to:This marks a step forward in Kuwait’s efforts to introduce tech-driven improvements in a sector that remains both sensitive and complex, particularly in terms of labor rights and regulatory oversight.The Domestic Worker Visa (Visa 20) is the standard visa used by Kuwaiti households to hire full-time domestic staff. Designed for roles such as maids, drivers, and nannies, this visa category is structured to support households that require assistance with day-to-day domestic work.To apply for this visa, sponsors are required to submit a comprehensive set of documents:This visa is considered the preferred legal route for Kuwaitis and residents looking to hire household help from abroad. The newly added verification step on Sahel ensures that employers do not unknowingly begin the hiring process for workers who already have active visa entries, thus saving time and preventing legal complications.The Sahel App, first launched in 2021, is a mobile platform developed as part of Kuwait’s national digital transformation initiative. It allows citizens and residents to access a wide array of e-government services from multiple ministries and agencies, including:Services available on Sahel include:The app is designed for accessibility, available in both Arabic and English, with the English version launched in 2024 by the Minister of State for Communication Affairs, Omar Al-Omar. This bilingual approach broadens accessibility to the expatriate community and reflects Kuwait’s commitment to inclusive digital services.Additionally, the platform is built with high standards of data security and user authentication, ensuring that personal information remains protected while allowing for seamless, real-time interactions with government systems.Beyond the updates to Sahel and Visa 20 processes, other regulatory efforts are also underway across Kuwait:The Supreme Committee for the Investigation of Kuwaiti Citizenship, led by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Fahad Al Yousef Saud Al Sabah, convened recently and disclosed a set of cases involving the revocation of Kuwaiti citizenship.Grounds for these actions included:The committee emphasized that all actions were taken in the “higher interest of the country” and confirmed that these cases would now be forwarded to the Kuwaiti Cabinet for final approval. Citizenship withdrawal remains a highly sensitive topic in Kuwait, often tied to discussions of national identity, legal rights, and political implications.Meanwhile, Kuwait Municipality is intensifying its inspection drives targeting businesses operating without valid advertising permits. During a recent field visit to a shopping mall in Hawally, inspection supervisor Bader Al Najdi reported:Offending outlets included those with:Al Najdi stated that inspectors are submitting monthly reports to the Financial Affairs Department, detailing violations, warnings, and fines collected. Businesses are being urged to strictly comply with municipal regulations, with Al Najdi affirming that inspection teams will maintain strict enforcement protocols to preserve public standards.","Kuwait ’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a new visa pre-verification feature for domestic workers (Visa 20) via the Sahel app. The move is part of a broader push to digitize services, enhance transparency, and streamline regulatory compliance in labor and immigration processes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124024412,imgsize-664893,width-400,resizemode-4/kuwait-sahel-app-domestic-worker-visa.jpg"

With no breakthrough in the case of Celeste Rivas, the teen whose body was found in a Tesla discarded by singer D4vd, several conspiracy theories have surfaced. The strangest of all is one spread by a social media user claiming that there are two Celestes and everything got mixed up in this very confused case, as D4vd did not issue any statement.Celeste Rivas, the teen, was reported missing from Lake Elsinore on April 5, 2024. Her remains were found in D4vd's Tesla on September 8.

In this mysterious and tangled story, Celeste isn't just one person; she has two faces. The first Celeste is 15-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez.

One possibility is that he (D4vd) developed an obsession with the younger Celeste.

So he's searching for the next substitute..."" the video said, questioning if the second Celeste is safe now.Though D4vd has not been named in the case, he is being probed and the Los Angeles home where he had been living was searched earlier this week.Reports claimed that Celeste Rivas' mother got a call from someone when her daughter was missing asking her to stop looking for her.

Dubai Fountain reopening set for early October

What’s new at the Dubai Fountain





Here’s what’s changed:





A brand-new flooring system now replaces the old foundation, which was known to crack over time. The new base is made of shiny, reinforced concrete designed to better insulate and retain water, solving a recurring maintenance issue.





Beneath that floor lies a carefully engineered waterproofing layer and an insulation system, topped with glowing blue tiles. These tiles aren’t just for looks, they reflect beautifully through the water and are visible from any vantage point around the lake.





The fountain’s choreography now relies on a new generation of robotic systems, each designed for precision:



Choreography bots guide the movement of the water itself

Lighting bots match visual effects to musical cues

Fixed water jets, dozens of them, are reprogrammed to spray in perfect rhythm with each show’s score







The scale and legacy of the Dubai Fountain





Its jets can launch water up to 150 metres high



It features 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors



Performances are choreographed to a diverse mix of classical, Arabic, and contemporary music





What to expect from the upgraded Dubai Fountain experience









After five months of silence, drained waters, and behind-the-scenes upgrades, the Dubai Fountain, the towering spectacle at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, is ready for its return. Emaar has officially announced that the world-famous attraction will be fully operational by October 1, 2025, marking the end of a massive redevelopment that touches nearly every element of the fountain’s structure and show. From state-of-the-art robotics to a brand-new underwater floor, this isn’t just maintenance, it’s a full-scale reinvention of one of Dubai’s most iconic landmarks.Dubai’s most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive and carefully planned upgrade project that saw the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake drained, fully exposing the massive technical infrastructure hidden beneath the surface. Now, with the crystal-clear waters refilled and the once-prominent giant digital display screens removed, the space is gradually beginning to take its familiar and iconic shape once again. In a recent Instagram post, developer Emaar stated that the Dubai Fountain is expected to be fully operational by Wednesday, October 1, although the attraction will not resume its captivating performances until “early October,” as final checks and adjustments are completed.The developer first broke the news via Instagram, noting that while work is nearly complete, operations will resume only once the team is confident that all systems, both technical and visual, are ready for a seamless experience. So while the date is marked, there’s still a margin for final tweaks before the relaunch.This was never just a cosmetic refresh. Emaar’s redevelopment focused on the structural foundation and performance technology — rethinking the fountain from the inside out.Every movement, every beam of light, every rise and fall of the fountain is programmed, and just a single song in the show takes several weeks of fine-tuning to execute correctly. The accompanying playlist, featuring over 48 carefully selected tracks, blends classical, pop, and traditional Arabic music to reflect Dubai’s cosmopolitan spirit and cultural heritage, enhancing the fountain’s grandeur and global appeal.The result is a completely rebuilt platform that still looks like the Dubai Fountain, but performs with a new level of power, elegance, and reliability.To appreciate the effort behind this upgrade, it’s worth revisiting what the Dubai Fountain actually is, not just in reputation, but in scale.Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, the Dubai Fountain made its official debut on May 8, 2009, alongside the opening of The Dubai Mall. Spanning 275 metres across the manmade Burj Khalifa Lake, it is the largest choreographed fountain in the world.With each show, the fountain has drawn millions of visitors, becoming a staple of Downtown Dubai and one of the most recognisable water performances on the planet.And despite the closure over the past few months, Emaar ensured that the space didn’t go quiet. During redevelopment, the site was fenced off, but not hidden. The barriers were embedded with digital screens, looping archival footage of previous shows in sync with the Burj Khalifa light display, allowing visitors to still engage with the spirit of the fountain even while it was offline.Once the Dubai Fountain resumes operations in October, visitors can expect a performance that feels both familiar and entirely refreshed.The sound and light systems have been enhanced, the choreography is sharper, and the integration of robotics promises smoother, more spectacular motion than ever before. The changes aren’t just technical, they’re immersive. These upgrades were built with both performance and maintenance in mind, ensuring the fountain can continue to run spectacular shows with fewer interruptions and less wear over time.And while the core elements, the music, the light, the water, will remain central to the experience, the visual clarity, dynamic precision, and overall grandeur of the show will reflect five months of engineering and design at the highest level.","Dubai's most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive and carefully planned upgrade project.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Lens on small-ticket personal loan defaults: RBI to look at use of device locking tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lens-on-small-ticket-personal-loan-defaults-rbi-to-look-at-use-of-device-locking-tech/articleshow/124033415.cms,"



MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: RBI is considering a proposal to regulate the use of device locking technology in case of continued default for some small-ticket personal loans - but with explicit safeguards. Sources said a final decision on the issue has not been taken, but the needs of consumers and lenders have to be balanced.In some of the loans used for purchase of things like smartphones, lenders are remotely disabling devices and locking the users from using the phones to recover their dues. While several low-ticket loans are now available to segments of the population that were earlier considered 'unbankable', there need to be adequate guardrails to ensure borrowers are not harassed, said a source.There is recognition that unbridled use of practices such as digital locking technology poses risks to borrowers, which impacts access to their personal data - including contacts, documents, work-related applications e-wallets, and educational material for children. For gig workers or small entrepreneurs, this may also mean losing access to navigation tools, client information and delivery platforms, hitting their ability to earn and repay.""Unlike traditional collaterals, where repossession is tangible and regulated, this digital form of control can be more intrusive and difficult for borrowers to anticipate or challenge,"" said a banking source.Besides, there is no redressal mechanism of wrongful locking of devices, which leaves the borrower completely at the mercy of the lender. Also, given access to such techniques, it is feared that lenders may not be adequately assessing the repayment capacity of the borrowers.As a result, there is growing recognition that if allowed under regulations, device locking should be accompanied by a clear and informed consent. There is also a need to provide sufficient notice after default before a phone is locked or restrictions are imposed, which should ideally be in a graded manner. Further, it should be ensured that there is no breach of data privacy.RBI's latest guidelines on digital lending released in May 2025 says that digital lending apps (DLAs) and lending service providers (LSPs) can collect only need-based data with prior, explicit borrower consent and an audit trail. They cannot access phone resources such as files, contacts, or call logs, and can use device features like camera, mic, or location only once for KYC with consent. Borrowers must retain full control over their data, including the right to deny, revoke, or limit consent, and to demand deletion. No biometric data can be collected unless legally permitted, and any third-party sharing requires explicit consent unless mandated by law.","RBI is considering a proposal to regulate the use of device locking technology in case of continued default for some small-ticket personal loans.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.
