Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal. The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108805388,imgsize-32690,width-400,resizemode-4/108805388.jpg"
Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics . With over 12 years at the helm, Mandeep has guided Cashify 's growth Prior to Cashify, he founded and led ZazzyBox and Manak Waste Management. His experience also includes a stint in investment banking at Lehman Brothers. Mandeep holds a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Panjab University. In an interaction with Times of India, Mandeep talked about Cashify's growth over the years, refurbished market and importance of sustainability. Excerpts:We started in 2013-2014, Our motivation was simple: we were driven by the idea of preventing e-waste. We saw a huge opportunity to extend the life of used devices. My co-founders and I come from a waste management background. We started a company in 2009 and spent a significant amount of time on actual waste management projects, including setting up and running a plastic and rubber waste recycling factory for two or three years. We became interested in electronic waste, but we realized that e-waste isn't really e-waste until it sits unused in your house.There were two reasons: First, we believe that our consumers are everywhere. They're both online and offline. Second, because we buy used devices, we refurbish and resell them. We realized about four years ago that trust was missing in the refurbished space. To build trust, we needed a physical touch-and-feel store where people could experience the phones firsthand. Every phone we sell could be different, so having a physical store helps people build trust. These offline stores also serve as service centers. At Cashify, we are also investing in technology to further streamline our operations and enhance the customer experience.As for numbers, our stores are spread across the top 90 cities in the country. We have stores in all major cities like Bangalore, Delhi, etc., as well as smaller cities like Agra, Meerut, and other tier two and tier three cities.Yes, one can. But, we accept devices up to a certain age. For older devices, we offer a recycling program. This means that we will take your old, but we may not be able to give you a value for it. We have a service where we will pick it up from your doorstep, send it to an authorized e-waste recycler, and send you a certificate of destruction via email.Right now, we only do it for phones. We will be launching laptop recycling soon.Our core mission is to extend the life of devices, reducing the need for new production and minimizing e-waste. By refurbishing and reselling, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future. We are also exploring initiatives like recycling programs and partnerships with brands to promote e-waste awareness. Cashify is committed to making a positive impact on the environment and providing affordable, high-quality devices to its customers. By choosing refurbished, you're not just saving money but also contributing to a greener future. We work with all OEMs in the country. Whichever OEM you name, we are there at the backend.Interestingly, it's benefited us. People are opting for refurbished devices as a more affordable alternative. We have seen a surge in demand for our refurbished products.We have our own state-of-the-art facility in Noida where we refurbish devices. Our expert technicians meticulously inspect and repair each device. We wanted to have one concentrated facility because refurbishing operations cannot be run in a very decentralized manner. Managing spare parts is a huge challenge. Noida has all those phone manufacturers, trained manpower, and spare parts easily available. Cashify also offers warranties on our refurbished products, it ranges from six to twelve months, depending on the model.We work closely with major retailers to provide buyback and refurbished device solutions. This includes partnerships with OEMs and retailers like Croma, Vijay Sales, Reliance Digital, and Apple authorized resellers.I wouldn't say it's the biggest season, but it's definitely a good one. We see a significant spike in the number of old phones coming to us. During that one month, the inflow of devices increases by at least 3-4 times.Yes, I recommend that people sell their devices as soon as they buy a new one. People often think they'll use their old device as a spare or hand it down, but that doesn't usually happen. They end up putting it in a drawer. Ideally, you should sell it immediately when you upgrade so you can get the best value. If you keep it in a drawer, it will eventually become e-waste and you won't get anything for it. These are valuable resources that are lying unused in people's homes. By selling them, you can extend their life and make them available to others. We've seen that this brings happiness to a lot of people. People are happy to buy an old iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 at a lower price. I've seen people from various demographics who are thrilled to get a phone like that for 25,000 rupees, which they couldn't afford new.","Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics.

Google's Quick Share file-transfer service may soon be available for iPhone and Mac users. A recent code change that was discovered in the project's source code repository suggests that this feature will allow users to easily share files between Android and Apple devices. Quick Share, introduced in 2020, utilizes a local network connection to quickly transfer files between devices and works only between Android and Windows devices. It comes pre-installed on most Android phones and Chromebooks and can be easily installed on Windows PCs. However, iOS and macOS users have been unable to utilise this convenient feature. The recent code changes suggest that Google is actively working to expand Quick Share's compatibility to include Apple's operating systems.According to a report by Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman, a recent bug fix in Google's Nearby Connections code hints at the possibility of Quick Share coming to iOS and macOS. The fix addresses an issue with localised device names, specifically mentioning its benefit for Quick Share on Apple's platforms, even though there's no official Quick Share app for them yet.While this could indicate Google's plans to bring Quick Share to iOS and macOS, it's also possible that they are simply fixing bugs proactively or laying the groundwork for future development. The exact intentions remain unclear as Quick Share's source code is not publicly available.While Google hasn’t officially confirmed plans for Quick Share on iOS and macOS, it wouldn't be a surprise as the company has already released the feature for Windows. However, achieving widespread adoption on Apple platforms presents a challenge.Distributing Quick Share as a standalone app may also face hurdles in convincing iPhone users to download it while integrating it into existing Google apps could be difficult due to permission limitations on iOS. Despite these challenges, expanding Quick Share to Apple devices could promote cross-platform compatibility and benefit users across ecosystems.","Google's Quick Share file-transfer service may soon be available for iPhone and Mac users.

The advent of the internet has transformed our lives, providing unprecedented convenience and connectivity. With this shift, digital payments have become integral to daily transactions in India, contributing to the country’s rapid technological evolution. However, this digital boom has also paved the way for sophisticated online scams that prey on unsuspecting users. From classic phishing schemes to more complex scams like SIM swapping and digital arrest fraud, these deceptive practices can have devastating financial and personal impacts. Here you can explore some of the most prevalent online scams in India, explains how they work, and provides actionable steps to protect yourself from falling victim.The UPI (Unified Payments Interface) refund scam is a widespread and deceptive scheme where fraudsters trick individuals into returning money that was never legitimately transferred to them. The scam begins when a perpetrator sends a payment to the victim’s UPI account and subsequently claims that it was sent by mistake, often citing urgent reasons like medical emergencies or essential expenses. If the victim agrees to refund the amount, the scammer reverses the initial transaction, leaving the victim out of pocket.Phishing scams involve fraudsters posing as reputable organisations to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. These scams usually come in the form of emails, SMS, or fake websites that appear almost identical to legitimate ones. The messages often carry an urgent tone, warning recipients that their account may be suspended or announcing a fake reward. Once victims click on the provided link, they are directed to a fraudulent site where they are asked to enter personal details like login credentials and payment information.In a SIM swap scam, fraudsters gain control of a victim’s phone number by convincing mobile service providers to activate the scammer’s SIM card. This allows the scammer to intercept calls and SMS messages, including OTPs (one-time passwords), giving them access to bank accounts and other linked services. Often, this scam is facilitated through collusion with insiders at telecom companies or by using forged documents.These scams involve fraudulent websites or sellers that lure customers with deals that seem too good to be true. Victims may provide their payment information only to receive counterfeit products, inferior items, or nothing at all. Scammers often create websites that mimic well-known retailers or advertise heavily on social media to attract potential victims.This scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officials and falsely accusing victims of being involved in illegal activities. The fraudsters use threats of legal action or ""digital arrest"" to create panic, coercing victims into making payments or revealing personal information. Payments are typically requested through digital means like UPI to avoid detection.With the push for KYC compliance by banks and financial institutions, scammers are exploiting the process. They pose as representatives from banks or telecom providers and claim that the victim’s account will be suspended if KYC information is not updated immediately. Victims are directed to provide personal information through a fraudulent link or phone call, sometimes resulting in unauthorised access to their bank accounts.","The advent of the internet has transformed our lives, providing unprecedented convenience and connectivity.

The week of Dec. 2, barring any unexpected delays,” Gurman said in his latest PowerOn newsletter.Apple iOS 18.2 is said to come with major improvements to Apple Intelligence - like ChatGPT chatbot integration, the Image Playground app and custom emoji known as Genmoji .

Cody Rhodes might not be the Undisputed WWE Champion for long

According to a report by Fightful, WWE superstar Cody Rhodes was being discussed for a Netflix movie role earlier this year. Netflix is paying a lot of money to get the Red brand over on their platform and wish to leverage WWE’s biggest names like Roman Reigns , Cody Rhodes and CM Punk.Now, while Netflix was discussing a movie role with Rhodes, talks eventually fell through. This could be because of Cody’s incredibly busy schedule. At the time of writing, Cody is the Undisputed WWE Champion and is on a run reminiscent of John Cena’s during his time at the top.Clearly, a star of his caliber can’t just leave his WWE fans hanging to go and pursue new projects in Hollywood. However, Cody might have to vacate the title within the coming months, which could open up his schedule a little. Let’s take a closer look at how this could come to be.Also Read: Cody Rhodes: 2024 Net Worth, WWE Salary, & More Rhodes finished his story at WrestleMania 40 and has been going strong ever since. But, as of right now, there are a lot of ways in which Cody could end up losing his title soon. For starters, John Cena’s retirement tour is coming up, and it is extremely likely that he will end up having another title reign before hanging up his boots and it wouldn't make sense for Cena to go for any belt outside the World Heavyweight Championship and the Undisputed WWE Championship.Additionally, Reigns is now back and is racing to get revenge against Solo Sikoa and his Bloodline. When and if he succeeds, Roman might also turn his attention towards the Undisputed WWE Championship. Last but not least, The Rock Final Boss has been eyeing Cody’s title for a while, and his appearance at Bad Blood 2024 indicates that he might make a move soon.So, it isn’t a long shot to say that Cody might lose his title soon. If this happens, his schedule will open up, and we just might get to see Rhodes put a few more Hollywood projects under his belt.Also Read: “This is a vanity business”: Cody Rhodes gave an explosive remark on body shaming in pro wrestling",Cody Rhodes was being discussed for a Netflix movie role earlier this year.
