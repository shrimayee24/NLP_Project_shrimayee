Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld breaks silence with official wedding photo fans were waiting for







Hollywood elegance met gridiron greatness as Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen officially became husband and wife in a magical ceremony held at the scenic San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. The wedding, which took place on May 31, was nothing short of a fairytale, blending cinematic charm with NFL prestige. With close friends, family, and a host of Buffalo Bills stars in attendance, the celebration quickly became the talk of both entertainment and sports circles.The wedding festivities began with a touch of chic simplicity—Steinfeld stunned guests in a stylish short rehearsal dress before walking down the aisle, hand-in-hand with her father, Peter. As cameras captured the moment, her smile radiated joy, but it was their first kiss as a married couple that stole hearts online. The photo of the kiss went viral, encapsulating the love and energy that defined the day.Among the attendees were Bills teammates Dawson Knox, Dalton Kincaid, Spencer Brown, Mitch Trubisky, and Shane Buechele, showing strong support for their quarterback off the field. The guest list even included a few surprises, like comedian and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" creator Larry David, whose presence only added to the buzz surrounding the event.Allen, 29, proposed to Steinfeld, 28, back in November with a cinematic sunset moment in Malibu—a fitting scene for a couple whose relationship has been marked by moments worthy of a Hollywood script. Since going public with their romance in 2023, they’ve remained relatively private, opting to share only glimpses of their journey with fans.But on June 6, just days after their vows, Hailee Steinfeld broke the silence with a heartfelt surprise. Though she wasn’t able to send out her usual Beau Society newsletter due to the whirlwind of wedding events, the Oscar-nominated actress delighted fans with a single yet powerful update. “We’re married! More to come…” she wrote, sharing an exclusive photo of the newlyweds that instantly made rounds online.That simple message ignited a wave of excitement among her subscribers and supporters, who have come to cherish the weekly newsletter she launched last September. While she's always been committed to maintaining that connection—even sending short updates during hectic weeks—this time, fans were more than understanding.Now, with her wedding dress still fresh in the minds of fans and supporters, Steinfeld seems to have embraced a new title entirely. As one viral Buffalo billboard so boldly put it, she really is “The Queen of Buffalo.”With love, laughter, and a wedding that seamlessly blended star power and sincerity, Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld have officially started their next chapter together—one that fans everywhere are cheering on.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST) The company is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names.

While Connor McDavid continues his relentless quest for the Stanley Cup with the Edmonton Oilers, his wife Lauren Kyle is quietly building a legacy of her own—and the NHL superstar couldn’t be more impressed. Known for her creative drive and entrepreneurial ambition, Kyle is turning heads not just as McDavid’s partner, but as a force in business, design, and hospitality.Lauren Kyle is currently managing five different ventures—ranging from a thriving interior design firm to a chic fashion label, a furniture showroom, a cookbook brand, and most recently, a trendy small-bites restaurant called Bar Trove. The restaurant’s launch in downtown Edmonton coincided with the Oilers’ return to the Stanley Cup Final, and it quickly became a local sensation.McDavid, in a rare and heartfelt comment, revealed what sets Kyle apart from other business minds. “Vision is one thing. Kyle's gift is making it come to life,” he said. “She comes up with an idea and just gets after it… So many people just don't follow through, and I think that's what separates her. It's been fun to watch her try something and then follow through and do it.”Beyond her professional achievements, McDavid noted that it’s Kyle’s compassion and heart that truly drive her success.He highlighted how her ventures aren’t just about aesthetics or profit—but about creating meaningful experiences for others.“She's got a big heart. She cares about people. I think that's why she's gotten into the field that she has,” he said. “She enjoys creating these experiences for people that she cares about and for others.”From designing custom light fixtures to organizing memorable moments like a surprise anniversary party as a child, Kyle’s hands-on approach speaks volumes about her dedication.

Thesystem at Mall of the Emirates (MoE) in Dubai began on February 3, 2025. Over the weekend before launch, motorists who visited the mall received notifications regarding the implementation of the new system, which had already been activated at Deira City Centre in January, according to developer Majid Al Futtaim (MAF).The introduction of this paid parking system was first announced in October 2024 after MAF entered into a five-year contract with Parkin PJSC, the largest operator of paid public parking facilities in Dubai. Using Parkin’s seamless parking technology, the new system removes the need for barriers or tickets, allowing motorists to drive in and out without stopping or waiting.Despite the upgrade, MAF confirmed parking fees remain unchanged, stating:“Our new seamless parking upgrade promises a ticketless and barrierless experience so you can efficiently enter and exit hassle-free without any delays or concerns about lost tickets.”A key new update relates to unauthorised use of the MoE parking lot as a traffic shortcut. Some motorists have been passing through the parking area to bypass congestion in Al Barsha’s internal roads and gain quicker access to Sheikh Zayed Road.To address this, MAF has clarified that even simply passing through the Mall of the Emirates parking area is now subject to a flat charge of Dh3.Parkin’s automated camera system scans license plates to track entry and exit times.There is no need for paper tickets or mobile apps.Motorists can extend or waive their parking charges under specific conditions. These must be validated at designated customer service counters:MAF said: “There is no need to register or sign up if the vehicle is already registered in the UAE.”The system is fully integrated with UAE vehicle registration data.MAF has assured that:MAF said their system has a 99.99% accuracy rate in reading number plates.“In the unlikely scenario this happens, the motorist won't be charged,” the company added.Motorists can report issues to 800-Park (7275) or visit the Mall Customer Service Desk for help.","Motorists do not need to stop at any barriers on entry or exit.

10 Eerie predictions from history that shockingly came true,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/10-eerie-predictions-from-history-that-shockingly-came-true/articleshow/121690444.cms,"

From Wi-Fi to World War, predictions that came true across the world

1. The Cold War- Alexis de Tocqueville (1840)

2. His own death- Mark Twain (1909)

3. Wireless communication- Nikola Tesla (Early 1900s)

4. World War II- Ferdinand Foch (1919)



5. Photo and colour technology- John Elfreth Watkins (1900)



6. Organ transplants- Robert Boyle (Mid-17th Century)

7. The Moon landing- Jules Verne (1865)

8. The Titanic disaster- Morgan Robertson (1898)

9. Satellite communications- Arthur C. Clarke (1945)

10. Smartphones and AI assistants- Ray Kurzweil (Early 1990s)





Predictions have fascinated humanity for centuries, whether they came from prophets, scientists, or writers. While most forecasts miss the mark or fade into obscurity, a rare few have turned out to be incredibly accurate. These striking insights offered glimpses into the future that seemed almost too precise to believe. Some were rooted in deep observation, while others appeared to be the result of sheer intuition. From world wars and space travel to the internet and organ transplants, these predictions came true in ways that continue to amaze us today. Here are ten historical forecasts that remarkably became reality.French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville predicted the rise of two dominant global powers during his travels in the United States. In Democracy in America, he wrote that Russia and America would one day ""hold the destinies of half the world in their hands."" This seemed unlikely in the 19th century, but Tocqueville’s foresight was remarkable. His prediction came true during the Cold War era in the 20th century, when the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers locked in a tense global rivalry that shaped world politics for decades.Tocqueville's insight was grounded in his analysis of political systems and societal trends. His prediction remains one of the most prophetic assessments of global power dynamics in modern history.Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, was born shortly after Halley’s Comet passed in 1835. In 1909, Twain made a striking prediction about his own death. He famously said, “I came in with Halley’s Comet… it is coming again, and I expect to go out with it.” This eerie prediction proved accurate when Twain died on April 21, 1910—just one day after the comet's return. His statement is often cited as one of the most personal and accurate prophecies ever made by a public figure. It added a poetic, almost cosmic layer to Twain’s already legendary life. The prediction reinforced his reputation not just as a humourist, but as a deeply intuitive thinker.Nikola Tesla was far ahead of his time in predicting the future of communication technology. In 1909, he envisioned a world where wireless messages could be transmitted easily and widely, so simple that anyone could own and operate their own device. Tesla also described a “global brain” connected by wireless networks, anticipating the modern internet. His remarkable foresight paved the way for mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and other wireless technologies that have become essential to everyday life, transforming the way people communicate, access information, and interact worldwide. He imagined a world where distance no longer hindered connection—a vision realized in today's digital age. Tesla's ideas continue to influence scientific innovation and popular imagination to this day.French general Ferdinand Foch expressed deep concerns over the Treaty of Versailles, signed after World War I. He believed the treaty was far too lenient on Germany and warned that it was not a true peace but merely an armistice that would last twenty years. His fears were tragically realized in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, triggering World War II. Foch’s statement showed his sharp understanding of the political realities and tensions that would soon escalate into another devastating global conflict just two decades after the end of the first.In 1900, engineer John Elfreth Watkins published an article titled What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years. He made several striking predictions, including the ability to “telegraph photographs from any distance,” foreseeing real-time image sharing and live broadcasts. Watkins also anticipated the development of full-color photography at a time when black-and-white photos were the norm. His vision accurately forecasted technological advances that have since revolutionized media, communication, and entertainment, shaping how people capture and share moments in vibrant color and instant detail.Robert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry, imagined future medical breakthroughs long before they were possible. Among his scientific hopes was the “cure of diseases by transplantation,” despite having no scientific basis or technology to achieve this at the time. Nearly three centuries later, Boyle’s vision became reality when the first successful human kidney transplant was performed in 1954. His foresight reflects the spirit of scientific progress—anticipating life-saving treatments that continue to evolve and transform modern medicine today.Jules Verne’s science fiction novel From the Earth to the Moon described a manned mission to the moon launched from Florida. The story included a capsule called the “Columbiad,” carrying three astronauts who splashed down in the ocean upon return. Verne’s imaginative details were astonishingly accurate. Exactly 100 years later, NASA’s Apollo 11 mission launched from Florida with a spacecraft called “Columbia,” a crew of three astronauts, and a splashdown recovery in the ocean. His visionary writing remains a remarkable example of fiction predicting reality.In his novella Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan, Morgan Robertson eerily described the sinking of an “unsinkable” giant ship named Titan, which struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic. The story included details such as a lack of enough lifeboats, resulting in massive loss of life. Fourteen years after the novella’s publication, the real Titanic met almost the exact same fate in 1912. The parallels between Robertson’s fictional ship and the Titanic’s disaster continue to fascinate and shock readers and historians alike.In 1945, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed using geostationary satellites to enable global communications. At the time, this idea was purely theoretical. Clarke’s vision became the blueprint for modern satellite technology, which today supports GPS navigation, television broadcasts, and worldwide internet connectivity. The orbit Clarke described is now known as the “Clarke Orbit,” and his prediction helped shape the way people around the world communicate and access information from space-based systems.Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil foresaw a future where people would carry portable devices connected to a global network, offering real-time information and voice interaction. In the early 1990s, Kurzweil predicted the rise of smartphones and AI-powered digital assistants like Siri and Alexa. Today, these technologies are a part of everyday life, transforming communication, productivity, and personal convenience. His predictions highlight how artificial intelligence and mobile computing continue to reshape society in profound ways.","Predictions have fascinated humanity for centuries, whether they came from prophets, scientists, or writers.

From farm to retreat: A vision above the clouds





The first floor houses a restaurant, open-air café, and reading area serving fresh mountain-grown produce.





The ground floor includes viewing platforms, a multipurpose hall, prayer rooms, and playgrounds, all designed to let guests connect directly with the landscape and the land that sustains it.

Sharjah’s second mountain retreat





Far from the rolling vineyards of Tuscany or the sun-drenched slopes of southern France, grapevines are now thriving at 850 metres above sea level on the rocky, windswept slopes of Jebel Deem in Sharjah’s eastern mountains. In a landscape more known for its harsh terrain than fertile soil, the crescent-shaped Ghamam retreat has defied expectations, transforming rugged rock into a thriving vineyard, and this landmark moment unfolded at Ghamam, a new high-altitude development on Jebel Deem, where the UAE’s first mountain grape cultivation has just borne fruit.Named after the Arabic word for “ above the clouds,” the Ghamam project is part of a sweeping vision led by Sheikh Dr Sultan Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah. More than 4,500 trees, including grape vines, olives, apples, and pomegranates — have been planted on the slopes of Jebel Deem as part of the emirate’s ambitious strategy to green the mountains and cultivate food in unlikely places. Photos and videos shared bythis week captured the harvest, a moment that is both a technical milestone and a symbol of what sustainable mountain agriculture could look like in the UAE.“Its unique location provides visitors with a panoramic view of the city’s coastline and surrounding mountain valleys, offering a captivating experience and holding significant cultural and social importance,” according to documentation from the Sharjah Ruler’s office.The agricultural breakthrough is only one part of the Ghamam retreat, a crescent-shaped mountaintop destination combining farming, tourism, and leisure.The site spans 4,700 square metres and features two floors that blend mountain hospitality with immersive visitor experiences.The development serves dual purposes: showcasing high-altitude farming in action and offering a space for cultural, social, and educational engagement.Located within the Kalba region, the project adds a new layer to Sharjah’s growing reputation as a destination for innovative development. Kalba has already launched major attractions such as the Hanging Gardens, Al Hefaiyah Lake, and a landmark clock tower, positioning the city as a leading eco- and agri-tourism hub.The Ghamam harvest complements this evolution by offering aexperience for visitors, blending scenic tourism with food sustainability.The initiative also supports Sharjah’s broader environmental and economic goals. By integrating agriculture with tourism, the project creates multiple revenue streams while promoting agricultural education and sustainable practices.Supporting this remote operation is a robust infrastructure network, including 10 kilometres of newly built roads and two bridges. One connects Wadi Al Helo Tunnel to the new Sharjah-Kalba Road, while another leads directly to the peak. These roads are built to accommodate both heavy agricultural vehicles and tourist buses, ensuring safe and efficient access.Future plans in the area include a FIFA-standard stadium on Mount Daym, located 650 metres above sea level, where temperatures are projected to be 10°C cooler than the city. Alongside it, a 100-room sports tourism hotel will rise, connected to the Ghamam retreat via a dedicated pedestrian path. These additions are part of a long-term integrated mountain development strategy combining sports, hospitality, and sustainability.The Ghamam project follows the success of Al Suhub Rest Area, Sharjah’s first mountain retreat, built 600 metres above Khor Fakkan and inaugurated in 2021. Together, the two projects underscore Sharjah’s pioneering role in mountain tourism and eco-conscious development.As the UAE works toward the goals of its National Food Security Strategy 2051, initiatives like Ghamam offer a blueprint for turning difficult terrain into productive, economically viable, and environmentally sensitive landscapes.","Ghamam is the UAE’s first mountain grape cultivation project.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Enter your beneficiary ID, password, and captcha, then click 'Sign In.' To create and link your ABHA ID, hover your mouse over the 'Update' menu and click on ""Create/Link ABHA ID."" If you're creating an ABHA ID for family members, ensure each family member is mapped after the main cardholder logs in through the ""Beneficiary login."" Select ""I don’t have an ABHA number.""

You'll see the 'Link Status' option. If the details match, you can print the ABHA card by selecting 'print ABHA card.'

If you already have an ABHA number, follow these steps to link it with your CGHS beneficiary ID:

After Step 4, click on the 'Link Using ABHA Number' option and enter your ABHA number. Review the consent collection form carefully and provide your consent.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai says that he’ll keep hiring engineers

Microsoft cuts 300 more jobs after laying off 6,000 employees last month

Nintendo Switch 2 launches to sky-high demand and long queues



OnePlus 13s, OnePlus Pad 3 launches

Apple’s annual developers conference, WWDC 25 starts next week

Meta signs 20-year nuclear deal to power AI operations

The tech industry witnessed dramatic developments this week, from a spectacular public falling-out between President Trump and Elon Musk that threatens billions in federal subsidies, to Nintendo's Switch 2 console launch creating massive consumer frenzy with sold-out pre-orders. Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai bucked industry trends by promising continued engineering hiring through 2026, even as Microsoft cut another 300 jobs following last month's 6,000-person layoff. Apple 's WWDC 2025 kicks off next week with anticipated major iOS and AI updates, while Meta secured a 20-year nuclear power deal to fuel its AI ambitions, highlighting the week's mix of corporate drama, product launches, and the ongoing AI transformation reshaping Big Tech.After a friendship that began during Trump's 2024 presidential campaign when Musk publicly endorsed him following an assassination attempt, the relationship between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has dramatically deteriorated into a public feud. Their alliance, which saw Musk appointed as co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump's election victory, began unraveling in May 2025 when Musk criticized Trump's signature spending bill as a ""disgusting abomination.""The conflict exploded into the open on June 5, 2025, when the former allies exchanged a series of bitter insults on social media, with Musk claiming ""Trump would have lost the election"" without him and making explosive allegations about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein , while Trump threatened to terminate billions in federal subsidies for Musk's companies.The public breakdown of their relationship reached a tipping point when Trump admitted during an Oval Office press conference that he was ""very disappointed"" in Musk and didn't know if their friendship could be salvaged, even reportedly deciding to sell the Tesla he had purchased just months earlier during their alliance.Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced that the tech giant will continue expanding its engineering workforce through 2026, positioning the company against widespread industry fears about AI-driven job displacement. Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech conference, Pichai emphasized that artificial intelligence serves as ""an accelerator"" rather than a replacement for human talent, enabling Google to pursue greater opportunities in emerging technology sectors like Waymo autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and YouTube's global expansion.This hiring commitment stands in stark contrast to competitors like Microsoft, which have cut thousands of positions to fund AI investments, and even Google's own recent history of laying off 12,000 employees in 2023 with additional reductions following.Microsoft has eliminated over 300 additional jobs this week, just weeks after announcing 6,000 layoffs in what represents the company's second-largest workforce reduction since cutting 10,000 roles in 2023. While the specific departments affected in the latest round remain undisclosed, previous layoff patterns suggest software engineers and project managers are likely most impacted, as last month's cuts hit coding professionals hardest with over 40% of eliminated positions belonging to software engineers despite Microsoft's $80 billion AI infrastructure investment.CEO Satya Nadella has characterized these workforce reductions as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, explaining it as ""repositioning for what comes next"" in the company's AI transformation, which now sees artificial intelligence writing up to 30% of code in some projects. The layoffs reflect broader industry trends as tech giants like Salesforce, Amazon, and Google implement flatter organizational structures and reduce engineering hiring due to AI adoption, with Microsoft's cuts occurring as the company continues investing billions in AI while employing approximately 228,000 full-time workers worldwide.Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 launched earlier this week to massive consumer demand, with gaming fans lining up at electronics stores across Tokyo and pre-orders selling out within hours. The $499.99 console, featuring a larger screen and improved graphics compared to its predecessor, received 2.2 million lottery applications in Japan alone, while Target's pre-orders sold out in under two hours. Nintendo forecasts 15 million Switch 2 sales this financial year and has pledged to strengthen production capacity to meet overwhelming demand. With the original Switch selling 152 million units since 2017, analysts predict the new device could surpass 100 million sales by 2030, though supply shortages may persist for weeks or months as the company scales up manufacturing. OnePlus has launched two flagship devices in India, with the OnePlus 13s and the OnePlus Pad 3 tablet. The OnePlus 13s, priced starting at Rs 54,999, features a 6.32-inch LTPO AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage, while packing a 5,850mAh Silicon Carbon battery with 80W fast charging and a dual-camera setup with 50MP primary and telephoto lenses.Meanwhile, the OnePlus Pad 3 boasts a larger 13.2-inch 3.4K 144Hz display, also powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor with up to 16GB RAM, featuring eight speakers for immersive audio, a massive 12,140mAh battery with 80W SuperVOOC charging, and priced at $699.99 (approximately Rs 60,070) for the base 12GB+256GB variant. Both devices run Android 15-based OxygenOS 15 and offer enhanced productivity features, with the OnePlus 13s available in Black Velvet, Pink Satin , and Green Silk colors, while the Pad 3 comes in Storm Blue and Frosted Silver, available in Europe from June 19th and North America from July 8th, with Indian availability confirmed soon across major platforms.Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025 is set to kick off next week from June 9-13 at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, with the keynote scheduled for 10 a.m. PT on June 9 followed by the Platforms State of the Union Address at 1 p.m. PT.The event, which can be watched online via apple.com, the Apple TV app, and Apple's YouTube channel, is expected to unveil major software updates including iOS 19 (or possibly iOS 26 according to rumors suggesting a numbering system change), iPadOS, macOS, and WatchOS.This year's conference is particularly anticipated for potential dramatic design overhauls across Apple's operating systems, with Bloomberg reporting that iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 will feature new icons and menus creating a more cohesive style reminiscent of VisionOS, while Apple is also expected to outline significant progress in artificial intelligence with enhanced Apple Intelligence features and Siri improvements, as the company seeks to compete with Google's Gemini and other AI offerings from Android vendors.Meta has secured a 20-year nuclear power agreement with Constellation Energy to meet the growing energy demands of its artificial intelligence operations. The deal will expand output at Illinois' Clinton Clean Energy Center by 30 megawatts starting in June 2027, when the plant's current state-funded support program expires. This partnership will preserve 1,100 local jobs and generate $13.5 million in annual tax revenue while providing clean energy equivalent to powering a city of 30,000 residents. The agreement makes Meta the latest tech giant to turn to nuclear power for AI infrastructure, joining Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in similar partnerships as companies balance surging energy needs with greenhouse gas reduction goals.","Microsoft cuts 300 more jobs after laying off 6,000 employees last month.

Atkinson was convinced by Jobs to become 51st team member of Apple



Bill Atkinson , the Apple Computer designer instrumental in creating the graphical user interfaces that made the Lisa and Macintosh computers accessible to millions, has died. He was 74. His family confirmed the cause as pancreatic cancer in a Facebook post. He had a close relationship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs during the early 1980s when they worked on the Macintosh. Apple CEO Tim Cook has extended his condolences with a post on X (formerly Twitter).""We are deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Atkinson. He was a true visionary whose creativity, heart, and groundbreaking work on the Mac will forever inspire us. Our thoughts are with his loved ones,"" Cook said in a post.Atkinson was the programmer behind QuickDraw, a foundational software layer for both the Lisa and Macintosh computers. This library of small programmes efficiently displayed shapes, text and images on screen. Embedded in the computers' hardware, QuickDraw provided the distinctive graphical interface that presented a simulated ""desktop"" with icons for folders, files, and applications.Atkinson is widely credited with inventing key elements of graphical computing, including ""pull-down"" menus and the ""double-click"" gesture, which allowed users to open files and applications simply by clicking a mouse button twice.Before the Macintosh debuted in January 1984, most personal computers were text-based, requiring users to type complex commands. Graphics were not an integrated function, and mouse pointing devices were not common.QuickDraw was initially developed for Apple's Lisa computer, launched in January 1983. Though the Lisa offered early easy-to-use features for business users, its high price of $10,000 (nearly $33,000 today) led to its commercial failure.QuickDraw soon became the basis for the Macintosh's successful graphical interface. This approach to computing originated from the ""Dynabook"" project led by computer scientist Alan Kay at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s.In 1979, Xerox provided Jobs and a small team, including Atkinson, a private demonstration of Kay's work. Since they could not examine the software code, the Apple engineers made assumptions about the technology, leading to fundamental technical advancements and new capabilities.After the Macintosh's release, Atkinson conceived HyperCard, a programme that wove together text, images and video in a simple database. This software became a significant precursor to the World Wide Web.Atkinson was pursuing a Ph.D. in neurobiology at the University of Washington when Jobs convinced him to become Apple's 51st employee. Their relationship was close during the early 1980s as they worked on the Macintosh. However, when Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 to found Next, Atkinson declined to leave, citing his commitment to the HyperCard project.","Atkinson was the programmer behind QuickDraw, a foundational software layer for both the Lisa and Macintosh computers.

Updates on Apple Intelligence

Likely hardware announcements at WWDC 2025

Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025, promising a week of groundbreaking software announcements that will shape the future of its ecosystem. Running through June 13, the event will feature a keynote from Apple CEO Tim Cook at 10 a.m. PT (10.30 pm IST), streamed on Apple’s website, Developer app, and YouTube channel, alongside an in-person experience for select developers at Apple Park. Like every year, the event will be big on software.With the tagline “Sleek Peek,” WWDC 2025 will see updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, with a focus on design and AI integration. The headline announcement is expected to be a redesign of Apple’s operating systems, potentially rebranded with a year-based naming scheme: iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Reports suggest iOS 26 will undergo its most significant overhaul since iOS 7, introducing a unified design language with floating tab views, updated iconography, and glass-like UI effects inspired by the Vision Pro’s aesthetic. This cohesive look aims to rival Google’s Android 16 revamp, prioritizing fluidity and personalization across devices.Apple Intelligence, introduced in 2024, will see further enhancements, though not as the centerpiece. Rumors indicate Apple will open its Foundation Models to third-party developers, enabling custom AI-powered features in apps like Safari and Photos, which may be quietly rebranded as “AI-powered.” A long-awaited Siri overhaul remains in development but is unlikely to debut fully. Additionally, an AI-powered coding tool, possibly in partnership with Anthropic, could be introduced for Xcode, streamlining app development.iPadOS 26 may introduce a “Pro” version with advanced multitasking, improved external display support, and professional-grade apps, catering to power users. watchOS 26 is expected to support third-party Control Center widgets, while tvOS 26 could feature a revamped CarPlay UI and animated lock screen artwork. visionOS 26 may bring native support for gaming controllers like PlayStation and Xbox, alongside minor UI tweaks to bolster Apple’s spatial computing push.Hardware announcements are less likely, as Apple’s recent M4 MacBook Air release and focus on fall hardware events suggest a software-driven WWDC. However, speculation persists about a potential M4 Ultra chip reveal or Mac Pro updates, though these are considered long shots.Developers will have access to over 100 technical sessions, online labs, and one-on-one consultations with Apple experts, covering topics like Swift, machine learning, and AR/VR tools. The Swift Student Challenge will also spotlight emerging talent, with 50 Distinguished Winners invited to a three-day Apple Park experience.As Apple aims to balance innovation with its privacy-first ethos, WWDC 2025 is set to lay the groundwork for a smarter, more cohesive ecosystem, with iOS 26 leading the charge. Stay tuned for live updates as Apple unveils its vision for the future.","Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025.

FBI on how to safeguard against scammers

Scam Series: The ""Meme Malware"" WhatsApp Scam

The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) has issued an alert, advising all smartphone users in the US to be wary of scams designed to coerce them into sending money. These attacks, which often involve impersonating government agents, are a growing concern for law enforcement, it said.""Scammers are spoofing FBI phone numbers nationwide, impersonating government agents. Victims are tricked into thinking an arrest is imminent unless they send money,"" the bureau stated (via Forbes).""The FBI will never call you demanding money to get out of criminal charges. It’s a scam. Hang up and visit the FBI's ic3.gov to file a report,"" it addedNotably, New York State Police recently issued similar warnings, noting ""an ongoing phone spoofing scam"" that impersonates law enforcement or government agencies. These scammers demand personal information like Social Security numbers and threaten punitive action for non-compliance.As per the law enforcement agencies, these scams are designed to create fear and confusion by making calls appear to originate from trusted sources. This often leads victims to comply with demands or share sensitive information that can be used for further financial fraud.They also claim that scammers have started posing as bank investigators, fire department charity collectors and even claiming to be from jury duty, demanding payment to avoid penalties for alleged failure to appear.The FBI reiterates that these impersonation scams rely on intimidation tactics. Scammers typically use an urgent, aggressive tone, refuse to speak with anyone but the targeted victim, and urge victims to keep the demands secret from family, friends, or financial institutions.Demands for payment can vary, including prepaid cards, wire transfers, cash sent by mail or inserted into cryptocurrency ATMs, or even cash delivered to a courier at the victim's home.The FBI stresses that since these scams prey on natural fears, users should hang up immediately and that all law enforcement agencies will never make such threats by phone or text.","Scammers are spoofing FBI phone numbers nationwide, impersonating government agents.

When Satya Nadella revealed that up to 30% of Microsoft’s code is now written by AI



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shared an important advice for aspiring tech professionals. The Microsoft CEO recently appeared in a conversation with tech YouTuber Sajjaad Khade where he urged students to focus on building strong fundamentals in computational thinking , even as AI shapes the software industry. He stressed that despite AI’s growing role in coding, the ability to break down problems logically and design systematic solutions remains essential. However, Nadella warned that even with AI, success still depends on giving clear, structured instructions—a skill that blends technical knowledge with systems thinking.“The path to being that software architect gets speeded up,” Satya Nadella said, adding that soon, “All of us are going to be more software architects.”During the conversation , Khade asked Satya Nadella: “In this world of AI, if I'm a beginner, just want to break into tech, what's your number one piece of advice?”Nadella replied saying:Nadella explained using his own example saying he was able to fix a bug by just assigning it to the CoPilot coding agent. “Except I was thinking about it, it was a pretty cool issue, right? The issue was I did a filter, which was basically a percentile.. Creating a feature.

Jason Kelce shares emotional family moment—and Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson can’t hold back their reactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-shares-emotional-family-momentand-erin-andrews-and-charissa-thompson-cant-hold-back-their-reactions/articleshow/121715655.cms,"Jason Kelce melts hearts with family post as Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson gush over it (Instagram)

Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson are all hearts over Jason Kelce’s touching message about family







While Jason Kelce has made headlines for his powerful plays and passionate NFL takes, it’s his 3-year-old daughter Bennett—lovingly called “Benny”—who’s been winning over hearts online. Just two weeks ago, Kelce was deep in football talk, defending the much-debated “tush push” play on his podcast. But while the veteran center was fully immersed in gridiron strategy, Benny had her own priorities. When Kelce turned to her with a lighthearted question—“Should the Eagles be allowed to do the tush push?”—her candid reply instantly stole the show: “I’m in time out.”That abrupt yet adorable answer perfectly sums up Benny’s energy—a delightful mix of sass and sweetness. As the third of four daughters in the Kelce household, she’s already carved out a vibrant identity. Her siblings, Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), and newborn baby Finn, are no strangers to her big personality. In fact, Benny became a viral sensation earlier this year when the family announced Kylie Kelce’s pregnancy. The heartwarming snapshot featured all three big sisters in matching “big sis” sweaters. But what stood out most was Benny’s raw reaction—tears streaming down her face as the camera captured a truly honest moment.“I feel like we captured a very accurate representation of how each of the girls feel about getting another sister. At least Ellie, mom, and dad are on the same page!” Kylie wrote.Recently, though, it was a simple, everyday moment that propelled Benny back into the spotlight. Jason Kelce posted a hilarious photo of his daughter completely zonked out in bed, fully dressed in a bright blue outfit and shoes—clearly knocked out after a day full of excitement. He captioned the post with a relatable dad joke: “Me after drinking Garages all afternoon.” The comparison between a post-happy hour adult and an exhausted toddler struck a chord, and fans couldn’t stop laughing.NFL personalities joined in on the fun. “It’s the body placement for me,” commented Erin Andrews, while Charissa Thompson added, “Same girl.” But beyond the chuckles, it was Benny’s pure exhaustion and authentic vibe that had parents everywhere nodding in solidarity. That moment, much like her time-out declaration, reminded everyone that kids bring a refreshing honesty to life—even when their dads are busy talking football.Whether she’s unintentionally ending football debates or collapsing mid-outfit into a nap, Benny Kelce is proving to be a scene-stealer in her own right. And with each charming appearance, she continues to showcase the softer, more humorous side of one of the NFL’s most beloved families.Also Read: Nick Chubb and Joe Mixon together?
