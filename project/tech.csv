But NFL Came through



""Needed that laugh @PatMcAfeeShow. Love you all ❤️""

""WOW,

didn't even eat a shot that hard.""

""I will not be talking to you.""

More Power To The Couple



“Miles, Keleigh, and Bugsy, we are happy you’re OK. Sucks that it happens, in a bad, bad way. But knowing Miles, even in this negative, devastating thing, he’s going to bring the juice. That guy’s awesome.”

""Pacific Palisades, I love you beyond measure. We will come back stronger than ever.”

The recent Los Angeles wildfires tore through the area of Pacific Palisades and left Miles and Keleigh's stunning home reduced to ashes. All of those memories were destroyed within seconds. And that's not all. The tragic part is, Keleigh claimed her biggest regret was not holding onto her wedding dress. Gosh, how bad must it hurt? She posted this brutally honest and tearful message on Instagram, ""There are no words."".If you're in the LA area, PLEASE GET OUT if you can I wish I took my wedding dress…. wish I did a lot different but doesn't matter STAY SAFE"" She even shared pictures of them at home-even before and after-contrast, Absolutely gut wrenching.In the middle of all these catastrophes, Keleigh had found unexpected solace-The Pat McAfee Show . Yep, she tuned into that, probably just looking for a little distraction, and ended up laughing her heart out at the banter between Pat McAfee and Aaron Rodgers . There was this one moment with Pat when he shared that hilarious story of Miles. Keleigh loved it so much that she hopped on X (Twitter) to say,Well, here's a fun flashback. In 2021, there was a bit of drama between Miles and Pat. It all began when Pat joked about Miles getting into a bathroom brawl in Hawaii during a WWE SmackDown event. Pat didn't know the whole story and made a crack saying,Miles was actually jumped by two guys, and he wasn't laughing. Things went quite tense on social media, but Pat apologized soon, and things were fine between them.And to make matters even more bizarre, Miles and Pat even had an argument at one point during the UFC event. Keleigh tried to intervene and stick up for her husband, but Pat did not know who she was at the time, so he responded with,Try to imagine the awkwardness there. However, later on, Pat revealed he was entirely mistaken about Miles and now has ""mad respect"" for him.But the chuckles didn't stop there for Pat. As part of his set, he also offered sincere prayers to Miles, Keleigh, and Bugsy the dog. He added something like this:And Keleigh? She's holding onto the support she's been getting. She thanked everybody who reached out and showed their love for her community, saying,So, what’s the takeaway? This story is about resilience, finding light in dark times, and, oddly enough, how humor can sometimes save the day. From losing a home to finding solace in unexpected places like a sports talk show, Miles and Keleigh’s story is proof that even when life throws punches, you can get back up and fight.

Tom Brady’s Ex Wife Gisele Bundchen Was Accused Of Cheating On Him



Gisele Bundchen Has Now Moved On With Her Life



Tom Brady, the former NFL player turned sports analyst, has been officially single ever since he separated from his ex wife, Gisele Bundchen, back in October 2022. Recently, Gisele Bundchen’s pictures went viral when she flaunted her baby bump as she was spotted in Miami. But a couple of months ago, Gisele was accused of cheating on her ex husband, Tom Brady.When the Netflix special, “The Roast Of Tom Brady” released, it caused widespread criticism as many of the “roasts” were directed towards Tom’s ex wife, Gisele. Many of the jokes also hinted at Gisele engaging in infidelity while she was married to Tom Brady.One of the jokes that was made at Gisele’s expense was made by famous comedian Kevin Hart when he said, ""You sometimes got to f*** your coach. You know who else f***ed their coach? Gisele. She f***ed that karate man."" This joke was made in reference to Gisele dating Joaquim Valente, a jiu-jitsu coach.As per Page Six, Gisele was “deeply hurt” by such jokes and was extremely disappointed. According to U.S Weekly, the NFL icon, Tom Brady. even apologised to his ex wife for such “jokes” that were made at her expense.However, a few months later, Gisele opened up about her experience to the New York Times and denied all allegations of people accusing her of cheating on Tom Brady while they were married.

This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful.”Tom Brady’s ex wife, Gisele, also spoke about how women have it tougher since they have to face a lot of people. She added, “They have to deal with their communities. They have to deal with their family.""But now it seems like, Gisele is pretty happy in her life as she is currently enjoying her pregnancy.

Ken Rosenthal Supports Scott Boras' Bold Negotiation Tactics for MLB Free Agents Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/ken-rosenthal-supports-scott-boras-bold-negotiation-tactics-for-mlb-free-agents-pete-alonso-and-alex-bregman/articleshow/117340990.cms,"Image Source - Getty

Scott Boras's High-Risk, High-Reward Strategy

Preference for Flexibility and Its Impact on Player Contracts

As the conversation heats up about the free agency moves of MLB stars Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman, baseball expert Ken Rosenthal has jumped in to back agent Scott Boras. Alonso turned down a hefty seven-year, $158 million contract from the Mets, while Bregman passed on a six-year, $156 million offer from the Astros. This has stirred up some criticism regarding Boras's negotiation approach.Rosenthal points out how Boras smartly uses short-term contracts with opt-out clauses to help his clients make more money. He gives the example of pitcher Blake Snell, who signed a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants that let him leave after the first year.Snell took that option and went on to sign a five-year, $182 million contract with the Dodgers, adding up to a total of six years and $214 million. This strategy shows how Boras knows how to work the market, using player performance to score bigger contracts.Right now, the MLB free agent market is trending towards short-term contracts that come with opt-out options. Teams are keen on maintaining roster flexibility and steering clear of long-term financial commitments. This trend allows agents like Boras to negotiate significant short-term deals with high average annual values, betting on their clients' future success to land even larger contracts.Still, there are risks associated with this method since it hinges on the player continuing to perform at a high level and the market being ready to present more favorable terms in the future.While some folks might not be fans of Boras's methods, Rosenthal points out that we should really focus on the long-term success of these contracts. The true worth of these deals only shows up after they're signed and new talks kick off. This idea suggests that, despite any short-term pushback, Boras' tactics generally yield positive outcomes for his clients, bolstering his reputation as a fierce negotiator in baseball.Ken Rosenthal’s endorsement of Scott Boras in the contract discussions for Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman sheds light on the complexities of today’s MLB contract negotiations. Boras employs smart moves, such as short-term contracts with opt-out options, to secure the best financial outcomes for his clients in a shifting market.These methods may face some backlash, but we can only really assess how well they work as we see the outcomes of future negotiations unfold.","Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman turned down hefty contracts from the Mets and Astros, respectively.

Sound and video of meteorite crashing to Earth captured on video in P.E.I.

For the first time, a doorbell camera has captured both the sight and sound of a meteorite striking the Earth, marking a significant milestone in scientific documentation.In July 2024, Joe Velaidum and his partner, Laura Kelly, witnessed the extraordinary event outside their home in Marshfield, Prince Edward Island, according to CBC News.Velaidum’s Ring camera recorded the meteorite's fiery descent and audible impact as it struck the ground just steps from his front door, leaving a dent in the walkway and scattering debris.The meteorite, later identified as an ordinary chondrite, travelled from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter before its fateful collision.After discovering black debris on his property, Velaidum consulted University of Alberta meteorite curator Chris Herd. As per CBC News, Herd confirmed the rock’s extraterrestrial origins and named it the Charlottetown Meteorite , honouring its proximity to the island's capital. In total, 95 grams of fragments were collected, with analysis revealing the rock’s high-speed entry, approximately 60,000 km/h, before slowing to 200 km/h upon impact.“This event is truly unprecedented,” CBC News quoted Herd. “It’s the first time both the sights and sounds of a meteorite impact have been captured. From a science perspective, it’s new.”The recently surfaced video not only provides extraordinary visual but also unique auditory evidence of the meteorite’s collision, a breakthrough for researchers studying these rare phenomena.Velaidum narrowly escaped harm and recounted, “If I’d lingered just minutes longer, I might’ve been standing right in the impact zone. It’s surreal to think that something travelled millions of miles to land right on my doorstep.”The event left Velaidum and Kelly in awe of the cosmos’ unpredictability. “It’s humbling,” Velaidum said, reflecting on the odds of such a close encounter.As per PetaPixel, this meteorite is the first ever documented on Prince Edward Island, adding a unique chapter to the island’s history. Herd emphasised its significance: “Every time this happens, it’s a new sample from space—a testament to the wonders of our universe.”","Sound and video of meteorite crashing to Earth captured on video in P.E.I.

She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

Poll What Do You Think About Hindenburg Research Shutting Down? Surprising Decision After Major Revelations A Bold Move After a History of Impactful Reports

Why has Hindenburg Research shut down?

Below is the full text of his personal note:

As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.

I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.

I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.

When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.

It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.

And then this slowly started to flourish.

One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.

They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.

We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.

Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.

And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.

Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.

It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.

I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.

So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.

Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.

Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.

My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.

For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.

It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.

To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.

Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.

With unfathomable levels of gratitude,

Nate Anderson","Hindenburg Research shut down after more than a year of work.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Microsoft to end Microsoft 365 apps support for Windows 10 on this date,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-to-end-microsoft-365-apps-support-for-windows-10-on-this-date/articleshow/117319046.cms,"Challenges with Windows 11 Adoption

Microsoft extends security updates for Windows 10

Microsoft has announced that its Office apps, now called Microsoft 365 apps, will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025. In a blog post, Microsoft stated, “Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11 .” The date also marks the end of official support for the Windows 10 operating system. To continue using Microsoft 365 apps without issues, users will need to upgrade to Windows 11.Microsoft says that though after the support ends, the Office apps won’t stop working right away. However, users might face performance and reliability problems over time, the company warns.Microsoft is pushing users to upgrade to Windows 11, calling 2025 “the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh.” Speaking at CES, Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, emphasized the importance of upgrading:“We believe that one of the most important pieces of technology people will look to refresh in 2025 isn’t the refrigerator, the television or their mobile phone. It will be their Windows 10 PC, and they will move forward with Windows 11”.Many Windows 10 users haven’t switched to Windows 11 yet, partly because older PCs don’t meet the strict hardware requirements. For instance, Windows 11 demands a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which Microsoft says is “non-negotiable.” Gamers too are reluctant to switch to Windows 11, citing concerns about compatibility and performance.To encourage users to upgrade, Microsoft has started showing full-screen prompts suggesting they buy new PCs.While the support for Windows 10 will end this year, Microsoft is offering Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for the first time. Consumers can pay $30 for an extra year of updates, while businesses can purchase up to three years of extended support.As the October 2025 deadline approaches, Microsoft is making it clear that upgrading to Windows 11 is essential for a seamless experience with its apps and services.","Microsoft 365 apps will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025.

"Apple products lost in the LA fire may not be covered by AppleCare+, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-products-lost-in-the-la-fire-may-not-be-covered-by-applecare-heres-why/articleshow/117307874.cms,"Representative Image

What AppleCare+ policies say about fire damages



What it means for users



Victims affected by the Los Angeles wildfire who lost their Macs may have to look to their homeowner's insurance for replacement, not AppleCare. While AppleCare offers protection against certain damages, it generally doesn't cover fire damage. The wildfires in California have caused widespread property loss, including homes, businesses, and personal belongings. Thousands of people have been affected, and those needing to replace their Macs will likely find better support through their homeowner's insurance policies. Apple 's AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs. Similar to other warranties and insurance policies, the agreement clearly states its limitations.The ""What is not Covered?"" section of the AppleCare+ policy agreement lists scenarios that won’t be covered includes damage caused by ""accident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external causes."" This means damage from fire, or even water damage from firefighting efforts, will not covered.Submitting a Mac for repair or replacement after it has survived a house fire, even if it appears intact externally, will likely be rejected. Additionally, if your house was evacuated as a precaution but left unscathed by the fire, it could still become a target for theft. The policy explicitly states it does not cover ""lost or stolen"" hardware, noting, ""This Plan only covers Covered Equipment that is returned to Apple in its entirety.""Apart from this, the company is offering other support to those affected by the LA wildfires. Apple Card users in FEMA-designated disaster areas can defer payments without interest accrual by contacting Apple Card Support.Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple is donating to support wildfire victims and recovery efforts.While AppleCare is helpful for typical Mac issues, it's not a comprehensive insurance plan and has limitations. It's designed to cover repairs for specific problems, not for events like natural disasters or theft. For broader protection, insurance is the more appropriate solution.Instead, Mac owners affected by wildfires should turn to homeowner's or renter's insurance, which typically covers property damage and loss, including electronics. Businesses can use property insurance for similar claims, while travellers should review their travel insurance policies for coverage of damaged or lost items.","AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.

""Additionally, our partner, PalmFit, is a local UAE manufacturer, which reduces the footprint from kit transport by eight percent.

Will Dominik Mysterio Turn Face?

WWE superstar , Dominik Mysterio has been named as Pro Wrestling Illustrated’s “2024 Most Hated Wrestler of the Year.” While the name may not show it, this is actually the perfect award for Dirty Dom. Mysterio has been the most polarising wrestler on the roster and his romantic storylines have often been the topic of debate among the WWE Universe. Of course, Mysterio being a heel is often one of the most disliked and disrespected wrestlers during these debates. However, his character might be about to undergo massive changes.Continue reading to learn more about the possible character changes that await Dominik Mysterio.Mysterio’s relationship with Rhea Ripley is clearly over following RAW’s debut on Netflix. On the January 6th episode, Ripley defeated Liv Morgan to become the new Women’s World Champion. Following Ripley’s win, Dominik Mysterio went into the ring to embrace Ripley. The Eradicator quickly shot down Dom’s advances by hitting him with a low blow followed by a Riptide.Now, on RAW the following week, Dominik Mysterio apologized to Liv Morgan. But there seems to be a very real crack in Mysterio’s relationships following his actions on the January 6th episode. This could be foreshadowing that Mysterio’s relationship with Morgan is also about to come to an end. If this is the case, Dominik Mysterio would once again be free to do his own thing.While Dirty Dom has thrived as a heel, it would be interesting to see what his character would be like if he turned face. Fans have begun to speculate about the same following RAW’s debut on Netflix. When he’s in the ring, Mysterio does have the ability to get the crowd behind him. We saw this a few weeks ago when footage surfaced showing the crowd chanting for Mysterio during a dark match with Gunther.ALSO READ: WWE Friday Night SmackDown preview and streaming details (01/17): Full match card and segments, show highlights, how to watch, and more It also wouldn’t be shocking if Mysterio goes after a championship while playing a heel.

What did Charlotte Flair do to address her haters?



“Charlotte, she’s selfish, she’s just Ric Flair’s daughter. She’s gonna come back washed. She’s not even that good. Oh, she’s been handed everything. You’re gonna prove them wrong. Ashley, get out of your f*cking head.”

Charlotte Flair has been absent from WWE television programming since December 2023. As her return potentially draws closer, Flair dropped another hint while firing back at her haters.Charlotte Flair is regarded as one of the greatest WWE female stars of all time. The daughter of 16-time World Champion Ric Flair , Flair has managed to break out from his shadow and create a historical legacy of her own.The Queen has won a record-breaking 14 WWE Women’s titles and multiple other accolades and has been part of some of the high-profile matches, including main eventing the first-ever women’s match at WrestleMania 35.However, Flair’s momentum was derailed in a huge way during her match with The Empress of Tomorrow, Asuka, on an edition of SmackDown in December 2023. A devastating spot led to Charlotte Flair suffering a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus. She underwent surgery and has been rehabbing since to make her comeback to the squared circle.The Queen has been spotted training inside the ring on multiple occasions, and recent reports suggest that Charlotte Flair’s return will be sooner rather than later.

Her return can happen anytime soon, with WWE having some plans and ideas in place once The Queen makes her comeback. Moreover, during her hiatus, Flair has been a part of an independent movie project titled, You Lose You Die.With Flair dropping another hint pointing towards her WWE comeback while firing back at all her doubters and having much confidence, it will be interesting to see Charlotte Flair make her return to the company and begin a fresh chapter in the new era that has dawned since she left.Also read: The Nature Girl of WWE Charlotte Flair is Keeping Up With The Next Generation of Wrestlers With Recent NX","Charlotte Flair has been absent from WWE television programming since December 2023.

Here are three reasons why Brock Lesnar's participation in the Men's Royal Rumble match is essential, let's dive in!



1) To Shock Paul Heyman



Brock Lesnar wins second Men's Royal Rumble Match: Royal Rumble 2022

2) Increase in viewership



3) Royal Suplex City Rumble



Brock Lesnar Dominates Royal Rumble | WWE Royal Rumble 2022 | Sony Sports Network

The WWE Universe is buzzing with excitement for the 2025 Royal Rumble, which promises to be a spectacular event filled with thrilling surprises. The Royal Rumble is famously known for delivering shocking moments, often marked by the unexpected returns of superstars who have been absent from television for extended periods.This year's event is shaping up to be one of the greatest ever, with iconic names like John Cena , Roman Reigns, CM Punk, Drew McIntyre, Seth Rollins, Logan Paul, and many others set to compete.However, the true thrill of the 30-Man Royal Rumble match depends on two key elements: the identity of the #30 entrant and the surprise entries that electrify the crowd.To make this year’s Royal Rumble truly grand, WWE should consider bringing back ""The Beast Incarnate"" Brock Lesnar. His entry would not only elevate the excitement but also make this Royal Rumble one for the history books, potentially boosting viewership significantly.The 2025 Men's Royal Rumble match is set to feature former WWE Undisputed Champion Roman Reigns. During SmackDown, Paul Heyman, the Wiseman, confirmed that Reigns would participate in this year’s Royal Rumble, aiming to reclaim the WWE Undisputed Title. If WWE includes Brock Lesnar in the match, it would undoubtedly inject an extra layer of excitement and come as a shock to Heyman. Lesnar’s presence guarantees intense action, and if he takes Reigns to Suplex City, it would be fascinating to witness Heyman’s reaction as his former client dismantles his current one, the Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns.Last year’s Royal Rumble set new viewership records, and according to Fightful Select, Royal Rumble 2024 achieved the highest viewership in the event’s history. This success was attributed to the thrilling matches on the card and the much-anticipated returns of Naomi, Andrade, and Liv Morgan. The 2024 Men's Royal Rumble also featured CM Punk, who had made his comeback at Survivor Series 2023, further boosting interest.To make this year’s Royal Rumble equally spectacular and break viewership records, WWE could introduce Brock Lesnar in the 2025 Men's Royal Rumble match. Lesnar’s involvement would undoubtedly create a buzz online, drawing global attention to the match and driving viewership to new heights.If the goal is to make this year's Men's Royal Rumble match truly unforgettable, why not unleash Suplex City? Imagine Brock Lesnar stepping into the ring and delivering suplex after suplex, tossing competitors left and right. It's been a while since we've witnessed Lesnar dominate with his signature suplexes, and his presence would undoubtedly take the action to the next level. The energy in the arena would be electric, and fans would be treated to an unforgettable spectacle. Including Lesnar in this year's Royal Rumble would elevate the excitement and ensure a thrilling showcase of mayhem in the ring.","The 2025 Men's Royal Rumble match is set to feature former WWE Undisputed Champion Roman Reigns.
