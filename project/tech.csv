DEHRADUN: A man narrowly escaped death after the flash flood swept through Dharali village in Uttarkashi on Tuesday, triggering a massive pile of debris.He was seen crawling out from the rubble, covered in mud and visibly injured, moments after the deadly waters destroyed homes, shops and roads in seconds.The man's identity and his current condition remained unknown as of Tuesday evening, but widely circulated videos have already hailed him as a hero.Officials have not yet confirmed whether he was later taken to hospital or rescued by disaster response teams.The video captured by a local resident from an elevated area showed the moment a sudden torrent of water, mud, and rocks came crashing down from the hills over the Kheer Gad stream.The flood's strong current flattened everything in its path. Someone in the background can be seen shouting and prodding the man in the slush to launch a dash to safety. ""Bhag, bhag! (Run, run!).""As the camera pans across the wreckage, it captures the man struggling to crawl out of the debris. Limping and bruised, he drags himself across the broken terrain, holding onto the branches of a half-submerged tree briefly.Onlookers, watching from higher ground, then call for aid. ""Help him! Someone help him!"" one of them shouts.","A flash flood devastated Dharali village in Uttarkashi. A man was seen crawling from the debris after the flood. Locals filmed the incident.

Yes, it's a moral obligation. No, it's not the company's responsibility.

TCS responds: ‘Case of Unauthorized Absence’





NEW DELHI: A viral photo of a Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employee sleeping on a footpath outside the company’s Pune office has sparked widespread outrage on social media, prompting the IT giant to issue an official clarification.As per a social media post shared by the Forum of IT Employees (TITE), the employee, identified as Sourabh More, claimed he was forced to live on the street after TCS withheld his salary, despite his repeated pleas to the HR department. In a handwritten letter placed beside him on the pavement, More wrote:""I have informed HR I don’t have money and will be forced to sleep and live outside TCS on the footpath.""According to a summary shared by FITE on 'X', More reported back to TCS’s Sahyadri Park campus in Pune on July 29, 2025, but found his employee ID inactive and his salary unpaid. Despite informing HR during a meeting on July 30, the issue allegedly remained unresolved.The image of More sleeping outside the tech park quickly went viral.With the post, the FITE also issued a solidarity message, stating:“His courage to raise his voice in such dire conditions is commendable. While protest is a powerful message, we also urge such cases to be reported to the Labour Office for formal redress.”In response to the viral incident and media coverage, TCS issued an official statement, asserting that the issue stemmed from unauthorized absence and was handled as per internal protocols:“This is a case of unauthorised absence where the employee has been absent from office. In accordance with standard procedure, payroll was suspended during this period. The employee has now reported back and requested reinstatement. We have provided him accommodation for now and are supporting him in addressing his situation in a fair and constructive manner.”The company emphasised that after More’s return, he was offered support and temporary lodging, and efforts are underway to resolve the situation appropriately.","A viral photo of a Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employee sleeping on a footpath outside the company’s Pune office has sparked widespread outrage on social media.

AI tool Comet could replace a recruiter's week of work with ‘one prompt’

Taking over administrative assistant functions



Comet as an AI operating system for work



Reactions from the broader tech industry



Comet’s current availability and pricing



A shift in the nature of work



In a recent podcast appearance, Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas outlined a bold new direction for white-collar automation with the launch of Comet, an AI-powered browser that may soon carry out the work of recruiters and administrative assistants with a single prompt. The new browser, still in invite-only beta, is designed to integrate with everyday platforms like Gmail, LinkedIn, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. Srinivas demonstrated how Comet is capable of managing complex workflows, from identifying and contacting potential job candidates to handling follow-ups, organising meetings, and resolving scheduling conflicts.The project reflects a broader shift in how artificial intelligence is beginning to take over roles that were once thought to require a high degree of human input. By running background tasks continuously and following natural language instructions, Comet could make it possible for businesses to automate essential office functions that were previously the domain of skilled professionals. Srinivas described this development not as a far-off possibility but as something that is already happening in part—and which could be fully operational in less than a year.Recruiting is one of the most process-heavy areas of modern business. It involves screening profiles, gathering contact information, reaching out to candidates, tracking communication, and scheduling interviews. Traditionally, this work takes days of effort by recruiters and coordinators. Comet aims to condense that into a single prompt. According to Srinivas, a recruiter’s entire week of work could be replicated through automation that identifies ideal candidate profiles, drafts personalised messages, and manages all the follow-up without manual oversight.For instance, Srinivas explained how Comet could search for a specific group of professionals—such as Stanford alumni who previously worked at Anthropic—compile their LinkedIn information into Google Sheets, and automatically write tailored outreach emails. As the responses come in, Comet can log the status of each lead, schedule calls using Google Calendar, and even resolve conflicting time slots. The goal is not just to save time, but to redesign the workflow entirely.In addition to recruitment, Comet has been built to perform tasks typically handled by executive assistants. These include managing inboxes, preparing documents for meetings, sending reminders, coordinating with multiple calendars, and staying on top of logistics. According to Srinivas, the browser is designed to operate in the background while staying contextually aware of what the user needs.He described how Comet can follow up on conversations automatically, sync calendars to avoid scheduling errors, and maintain updated status logs across apps. This isn’t basic automation like email templates or keyboard shortcuts. Instead, it involves AI following ongoing tasks, reasoning across apps, and completing multi-step processes with little or no manual input.Srinivas also shared his long-term vision for Comet as more than just a browser. He sees it becoming a kind of operating system for white-collar productivity—something that runs quietly in the background, ready to handle user commands in plain language. This AI would not just assist, but take initiative in coordinating, tracking, and executing tasks across platforms.To emphasise the potential value of this approach, Srinivas gave the example of a company paying thousands of dollars for a single AI prompt, if the output helps generate real business results. Comet, in his view, represents the next evolution in digital tools, where the browser becomes a command centre for intelligent, end-to-end automation.The announcement and capabilities of Comet have reignited discussions about AI's role in future employment. Other tech leaders have expressed similar concerns and predictions. Dario Amodei, CEO of AI firm Anthropic, has estimated that half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear within five years due to automation.Ford CEO Jim Farley has also publicly stated that artificial intelligence may replace 50 percent of white-collar workers. However, not all industry voices agree on the scale or impact.Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Jensen Huang of Nvidia maintain that AI will serve as a tool for human enhancement, not outright replacement. In that context, Comet may be seen either as a threat to jobs or as a way to boost productivity without increasing headcount. What is clear is that the introduction of tools like Comet is already changing how work gets done.At present, Comet is being rolled out as an invite-only beta available to premium subscribers of Perplexity. The premium tier, which includes access to Perplexity’s advanced features, is priced at around $200 per month. Srinivas mentioned that future pricing may be structured around value-based billing. In practical terms, that means businesses may be charged based on the value they gain from the AI’s output rather than just usage hours or prompt limits.Although the browser is still in development, Srinivas suggested that its core functions—especially those related to recruiter and assistant roles—will become fully automated within the next six to twelve months. This timeline suggests that companies and workers may need to prepare sooner than expected for significant changes in workflow and job design.Comet represents more than just a new app or productivity tool. It shows how artificial intelligence can be integrated into something as familiar as a browser to perform meaningful work tasks across multiple platforms. Unlike past generations of AI that required specific APIs or single-purpose tools, Comet functions like a worker that can read your email, understand your calendar, communicate through your apps, and make real-time decisions.Srinivas emphasised that the people who embrace tools like Comet are likely to remain relevant in the job market. Those who avoid or delay using AI may find themselves falling behind. This isn’t simply about learning how to use software. It’s about rethinking the role of humans in an AI-assisted professional landscape. As Comet continues to evolve, it could reshape not only how we work but what work itself looks like. The line between assistant and autonomous agent is blurring—and Srinivas believes that future is already here.","Comet is an AI-powered browser that may soon carry out the work of recruiters and administrative assistants with a single prompt. The new browser, still in invite-only beta, is designed to integrate with everyday platforms like Gmail, LinkedIn, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. Comet has been built to perform tasks typically handled by executive assistants.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123116763,imgsize-38042,width-400,resizemode-4/Perplexity-CEO-Aravind-Srinivas-warns-that-AI-can-now-wipe-out-two-white-collar-roles-with-just-one-prompt.jpg"

Pamela Anderson says there is no feud with Meghan Markle over cooking shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/pamela-anderson-says-there-is-no-feud-with-meghan-markle-over-cooking-shows/articleshow/123119046.cms,"How the rumour started

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

China witnessed a miracle when a boy, who is just three years old, miraculously survived an extraordinary 18-storey fall from his residential building, with a tree breaking his fall.The event occurred on July 15 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, southeastern China, while the young boy was under his grandparents' supervision, South China Morning Post reported.The grandparents had stepped out briefly to purchase groceries, believing the child was asleep. They secured the flat's door to ensure his safety.Upon waking, the child entered the bathroom, which had an unprotected window. He climbed onto the toilet and subsequently the window, from which he fell.A tree intercepted his fall, enabling his survival. His father later placed a large red flower on the tree in appreciation.A passing resident discovered him and recorded a video, sharing it with the property management.The father, Zhu, initially doubted the 18-storey fall until viewing surveillance footage. He explained that an open window on the 17th floor altered his son's falling path, directing him towards the tree that cushioned his landing.At the hospital, staff termed his survival miraculous. His injuries included a broken left arm, spinal strain and internal organ damage, though his head remained uninjured.Remarkably, the conscious child requested: ""Ask Daddy to buy me a Bumblebee.""Zhu presented a large red flower to the tree, a traditional Chinese symbol of honour. The incident sparked online discussions, with comments ranging from criticism of parental oversight to expressions of relief at the boy's survival.","Three-year-old boy falls from 18-storey building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China.

Who is Matt Deitke? 24-year-old AI genius who rejected Meta’s $125 million offer and then Mark Zuckerberg personally met him with a doubled package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-matt-deitke-24-year-old-ai-genius-who-rejected-metas-125-million-offer-and-then-mark-zuckerberg-personally-met-him-with-a-doubled-package/articleshow/123071945.cms,"

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Deitke reportedly felt that joining too early would limit his freedom to experiment—a value he deeply prioritizes in his research philosophy. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time. His work on Molmo was widely praised across the AI community. It was seen as a major leap toward more human-like machine interaction.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. Molmo was even cited by OpenAI researchers as a benchmark system for cross-modal alignment testing, a rare recognition from rivals in the space. His contributions helped advance embodied and multimodal AI platforms that continue to support reproducible research and shared benchmarks. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Its early prototypes demonstrated impressive capabilities in task automation, sparking interest from enterprise clients and researchers alike. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt Deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

deliver high-power, rapid charging, often bringing EV batteries from 20% to 80% in under 30 minutes. This infrastructure supports Qatar National Vision 2030 by promoting clean transport, reducing emissions, and enhancing convenience through digital tools.









What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.





DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.





Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.





Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.





Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.









Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement





Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.





Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).





The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.









Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.





Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.





Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.













On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals.During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements.Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.Charging speeds are categorized as:These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.Qatar’s surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint. These high-speed DC chargers offer rapid refueling, increased convenience, and drive cleaner mobility choices.

Elon Musk teases Tesla update: Drivers could play video games while cars drive themselves; latest feature arriving within 3–6 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-teases-tesla-update-drivers-could-play-video-games-while-cars-drive-themselves-latest-feature-arriving-within-36-months/articleshow/123090344.cms,"Elon Musk says rollout depends on regulatory approval

Robotaxi rollout to follow in Chicago?

Mounting pressure after legal setback





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again stirred excitement and controversy in the automotive and tech worlds by revealing that Tesla drivers may soon be able to play video games while their cars operate in self-driving mode. The feature, expected to roll out within the next three to six months, will be contingent on regulatory approvals across various regions. Musk made the announcement on social media, emphasizing that the in-car gaming functionality will only activate while the Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is engaged and meets all safety standards. Boldly merging the worlds of mobility and interactive entertainment, Musk hinted that popular titles may be supported on Tesla’s high-resolution dashboard displays.Musk clarified that the timing of the gaming feature’s release depends heavily on regulatory approval from individual cities and states. In a reply to a user on X (formerly Twitter), he noted, “Probably 3 to 6 months, depending on regulatory approval in your city and state.” Tesla will proceed cautiously, he added, ensuring that the gaming integration aligns with all safety guidelines in autonomous driving jurisdictions.This move reflects Tesla’s broader vision of transforming the in-car experience. Beyond just transportation, Musk envisions Teslas as entertainment hubs with high-end sound systems, streaming capabilities, and now interactive gaming. The upcoming feature would let drivers and passengers enjoy video games during commutes, road trips, or while parked, blurring the lines between travel and leisure.The video game announcement coincides with Musk’s comments about launching Tesla’s Robotaxi service in Chicago. While responding to another user online, Musk hinted that Tesla would introduce autonomous ride-hailing services in any city where Alphabet’s Waymo is already allowed to operate. “Tesla will operate there as soon as we reaffirm safety testing in that locale and receive a license to operate,” he said.The update arrives amid mounting scrutiny over Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology. Just days before Musk’s statement, Tesla was ordered to pay over $243 million in damages related to a fatal 2019 crash in Florida. Critics have long questioned the safety of FSD, and industry analysts believe Tesla will face greater pressure to prove the system’s reliability, especially with plans to enable hands-free entertainment.As Tesla races toward full autonomy, the integration of entertainment features like video games signals a future where vehicles are not just smart but recreational. Whether regulators will share Musk’s enthusiasm remains to be seen, but the timeline he’s set could make the feature one of Tesla’s most talked-about updates of 2025. Musk believes that redefining the in-car experience is crucial to differentiating Tesla in an increasingly crowded EV market. If successful, the feature could set a precedent for other automakers looking to blend transportation with lifestyle tech.","Elon Musk says Tesla drivers may soon be able to play video games while their cars operate in self-driving mode.

Hidden deep within the Amazon rainforest, the Shanay-timpishka in Peru, more famously known as the Boiling River, is one of Earth’s most extraordinary natural wonders. This river is no ordinary body of water—it maintains extreme temperatures so high that they can reach 210°F (100°C), enough to boil living animals alive and inflict severe burns within seconds. Stretching approximately 9 kilometers, the river has intrigued scientists, explorers, and indigenous communities alike for generations, inspiring myths, sacred rituals, and relentless scientific curiosity. Its existence far from any volcanic activity challenges conventional geological knowledge, making it both a cultural legend and a scientific enigma. For centuries, it has been revered and feared by locals who rely on it for daily living needs, spiritual ceremonies, and medicinal purposes, yet respect its dangerous power and mysterious origins.The Boiling River was first introduced to the Western world through tales of Spanish conquistadors who ventured into the Amazon basin centuries ago in search of the fabled El Dorado, or the city of gold. Alongside descriptions of dense jungle canopies, poisoned-arrow-wielding warriors, and powerful shamans, they recounted a chilling natural phenomenon—a river so hot it could boil a human alive.For geoscientist Andrés Ruzo, these accounts initially sounded like pure folklore.However, during a conversation with his aunt, he was surprised to learn that the Shanay-timpishka was very real and part of the local culture. She even shared her experience of swimming in it safely after heavy rains cooled the otherwise scalding waters. This revelation shifted Ruzo’s perspective from skepticism to curiosity, ultimately motivating him to investigate the river himself.Driven by scientific curiosity, Andrés Ruzo travelled deep into the Amazon rainforest, far from any volcanic or tectonic hotspots that could normally explain such high temperatures. To his astonishment, he confirmed that the Boiling River indeed flows at dangerously high temperatures, reaching up to 210°F (100°C), equivalent to the boiling point of water at sea level. For comparison, the average cup of coffee measures only around 130°F (55°C), meaning direct exposure to the river’s water results in second- and third-degree burns within moments.The indigenous community has long adapted to its presence, using the river’s steam for cooking food, heating water, and even therapeutic purposes. Despite being potentially lethal, the river is considered sacred and integral to local daily life. Its existence, hundreds of kilometers away from any volcanic heat source, poses a mystery for scientists studying geothermal activity. Researchers continue to investigate underground systems, looking for unknown geological processes that could produce such an anomaly.With approval from local shamans and community leaders, Andrés Ruzo launched The Boiling River Project, an initiative designed to protect and study the Shanay-timpishka. The project focuses on several key areas:The Boiling River is more than just a geological wonder—it’s a testament to how local traditions, natural sciences, and global conservation can converge. It challenges existing geological models, offers potential insights into Earth’s geothermal systems, and highlights the delicate balance between nature and human life in the Amazon.","The Shanay-timpishka in Peru, more famously known as the Boiling River, is one of Earth’s most extraordinary natural wonders.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
