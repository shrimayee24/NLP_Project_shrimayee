As heavy monsoon rains lash several parts of India, a video of a young salesman braving the downpour to reach work has gone viral — sparking conversations around rigid office culture and unrealistic expectations from employees.The clip shows the salesman riding his bike in the rain without proper clothing, sarcastically narrating his ordeal. “I am going to work. I work in sales. The target has to be met. So I am going for sales,” he says, drenched, yet composed. “I am waterproof, friends. I am a waterproof person, I cannot get wet. The target must be met. We will sell so much that the company will go up, and we will go down. It will be really fun! The company must have sales. ”His deadpan delivery struck a chord online, resonating with thousands who face similar workplace pressures. The video, while humorous, shines a light on the everyday struggles of corporate employees — especially those denied the option to work from home, even during extreme weather conditions.Some users quickly responded to the video in the comments section. One humorously wrote, “Did you meet the target?” while another quipped, “Sell the company, bro.”A third commented, “There are toxic work scum everywhere.”Amid flooded streets and difficult commutes, the video has turned into a satirical but sharp critique of the expectations many employees face — highlighting the need for more empathetic workplace policies and flexible arrangements during adverse conditions.","A video of a young salesman braving the downpour to reach work has gone viral.

Developer's part of expanding multi-platform strategy

Deep Field Games ' acclaimed survival crafting title Abiotic Factor made its PlayStation 5 debut yesterday as a day-one addition to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers. The six-player cooperative game, which earned overwhelmingly positive reviews during its Steam Early Access phase, throws players into an underground research facility overrun by alien threats and military crusaders.Players must use scientific ingenuity rather than brute force to survive, crafting equipment from salvaged office supplies, alien artifacts, and destroyed computer parts. The game supports online multiplayer for up to six friends, allowing teams to tackle specialized roles including forager, fighter, chef, builder, or explorer as they navigate the sprawling GATE Cascade Research Facility .Abiotic Factor maintains a 4.62-star rating on PlayStation Store based on hundreds of user reviews, mirroring its Steam success where it achieved 94.38% positive feedback over 12 months. Players have praised the game's unique blend of Half-Life, Grounded, and SCP elements, creating what reviewers describe as an immersive survival horror experience with flexible base-building mechanics.The title joins an exceptionally strong July PlayStation Plus lineup that includes Cyberpunk 2077 , Diablo IV , and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, marking one of the service's most robust monthly offerings in 2025.The PlayStation launch coincides with Abiotic Factor's simultaneous release on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass, representing the New Zealand developer's push toward broader console accessibility. While Sony typically doesn't disclose retention periods for PlayStation Plus titles, industry trends suggest the game will likely remain available for at least 12 months.Players interested in the title should act quickly to claim other July bonuses, as PlayStation Plus members have until today to secure a 30% discount on Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, originally introduced when the base game joined the service earlier this month.","Abiotic Factor is a six-player cooperative game with online multiplayer for up to six friends.

Read Bill Gates complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phil and Gates agree to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder joined the customer service team for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment.",Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (previously known as Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. He co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery. The post was later reshared by CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (previously known as Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence.

Garena Free Fire OB50 Update FAQs

Will OB50 raise the minimum device spec?

Can Advance-Server progress carry into live servers?

Are previous Naruto Chapter 1 skins returning?

How do I report bugs post-update?

Is there any free way to get Rin?

Free Fire’s numbered updates usually tweak balance and drop a skin or two. OB50, however, lands at a turning-point moment for the game: ranked traffic is dipping, rival shooters are everywhere, and fans have begged for fresh mechanics. Garena’s answer rolls out around 31 July 2025 (after a two-week public test that opened on 11 July). Inside are a brand-new character named Rin, a follow-up to last year’s wildly popular Naruto collaboration, overhauled weapon stats, slicker menus, and at least one surprise mode aimed at streamers. Most of these features surfaced on the Advance Server, where dataminers and pro squads have already stress-tested the build. Below is a plain-language rundown of every change that matters, so you can decide whether to hoard diamonds, clear storage, or both.According to reports, early scrims show Rin pairs insanely well with Chrono and Alok: land two head-shots, pop Chrono’s shield, then beam enemies with near-zero bloom. Garena may tone her passive before global release, but if it ships intact, expect sniper-assault hybrids to dominate high-elo lobbies for at least the first week.Garena says no; any phone that ran OB49 smoothly should handle OB50, though 2 GB free storage is recommended.No. Cosmetic and level resets are total; only feedback and bug-bounty rewards remain.Leakers found no files for a re-run, so Chapter 1 cosmetics appear to stay vaulted for now.Use the new in-game “Bug Center” button under settings; logs auto-attach, and accepted critical reports pay 1,000 diamonds.Garena usually adds a milestone login campaign two weeks after launch—log seven days straight, collect tokens, craft a voucher that can be used in the Diamond Royale for a shot at Rin without spending real money.",Garena Free Fire OB50 update lands at a turning-point moment for the game. New character Rin is Hayato’s younger sister with a passive that tightens rifle spread after a successful head-shot chain. Weapon re-balance – M1887 gets a slight range nerf; Groza and SCAR receive recoil smoothing.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122859947,imgsize-45934,width-400,resizemode-4/Garena-Free-Fire-OB50-Update.jpg"

YouTube is rolling out some new generative AI tools for YouTube Shorts which will empower creators to create more dynamic content. The new tools introduced by Google’s video streaming platform include image-to-video feature and a range of AI-powered effects which will improve content creation on the platform. “We’re sharing some of our newest creation tools to make bringing your ideas to life on YouTube Shorts even easier and more fun,” said the company.The new image-to-video tool enable users to transform any photo from their camera roll into a six-second animated video. “Just select your image, choose a creative suggestion, and watch your memories come alive,” said the company in a blog post. Powered by Google’s Veo 2 video generation model, users can choose prompts like “Subtle movements” or “I’m feeling lucky” to animate landscapes, group shots, or everyday scenes. The feature is rolling out next week in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with more regions coming later this year.Creators can now access a fresh set of AI effects by tapping the “Effects” icon in the Shorts camera and selecting the “AI” tab. The new AI effects allow the content creators to transform doodles into artistic visuals, turn selfies into underwater scenes and also create ‘twinning’ videos with lookalike characters.

"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship, 'to get out of thinking'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teens-say-they-are-turning-to-ai-for-advice-friendship-to-get-out-of-thinking/articleshow/122872098.cms,"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship, 'to get out of thinking' (Image: AP)

How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers







TOPEKA: No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colours, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.The sophomore honours student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.""For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.AI is always available. It never gets bored with youMore than 70 per cent of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.""All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.""In the Common Sense Media survey, 31 per cent of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33 per cent had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement - not replace - real-world interactions.""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said.The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. The group recommends that minors not use AI companions.A concerning trend to teens and adults alikeResearchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character AI chatbot.""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.""Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.""Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper - our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.""""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it.""","Teens say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.

Democrat congressman Greg Casar introduces bill to ban AI-driven price; slams ‘surveillance pricing’; seeks Republican support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrat-congressman-greg-casar-introduces-bill-to-ban-ai-driven-price-slams-surveillance-pricing-seeks-republican-support/articleshow/122866540.cms,"Representational image





US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls “AI-driven price gouging”. The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product, a growing trend known as surveillance pricing.Casar, a Democrat from Texas, says tech companies are going too far by spying on people’s habits and financial history. “Prices should be based on supply and demand and based on how much it costs to make and sell a thing, not based on spying on you and using your private data,"" he told NBC News.The move follows a recent federal trade commission ( FTC ) report that found companies were using users' browser history, GPS location and shopping behaviour to silently adjust prices. The practice is common in e-commerce, and often powered by artificial intelligence.The FTC study, released in January just before president Biden left office, revealed that big firms like Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, Accenture and McKinsey were among those feeding AI systems with consumer data. FTC chair Lina Khan called the system a “black box” where users don’t even realise they’re being charged more based on hidden profiling.Casar’s bill would also prohibit companies from using AI to determine wages based on personal financial data rather than job performance.Several US states are also cracking down. New York passed a law requiring businesses to inform customers when prices are set using algorithms. California may soon follow. But Casar’s bill is the first push for a national ban.The House is about to go into recess, so the bill won’t move before September. But Casar hopes both parties can get behind it. “You don’t have to be a progressive Democrat to say these gigantic corporations in the tech world should not be spying on us and then using what they learn to put it into AI and make our life more expensive,” he said.","US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls ‘AI- driven price gouging’ The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122866910,imgsize-64540,width-400,resizemode-4/122866910.jpg"

Online users pointed out the irony, since Marx was a strong critic of capitalism and stood for socialism and communism.The incident has drawn attention to a growing trend known as necrotourism, where people visit cemeteries to pay respects and also to engage with history, art, and culture in new ways.Recently, Labubu dolls are hugely popular among collectors, with long lines at toy stores, waiting lists, and a resale market as intense as the buzz once seen around Supreme streetwear.Cemeteries like Highgate are now seen as cultural spaces. With old tombstones, historic trees, and well-known names buried there, they attract millions who come not just to remember the dead, but to reflect, explore, and even enjoy a quiet picnic under the cypress trees.What started as a niche interest has now become a billion-dollar industry.

A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing.

TL;DR

The Perseids are active July 17 to August 23, peaking August 12–13, but moonlight may affect visibility.

Best time to watch in the UAE: July 23–24 (new moon) or August 16–26 (post-peak, darker skies).

Top stargazing spots: Al Awir Desert , Hatta, and other low-light desert areas.

What Is the Perseid Meteor Shower?

When to Watch in the UAE



July 23–24 (Best Viewing Conditions): Just after the new moon, so skies will be darkest. You’ll see fewer meteors than at peak, but visibility will be much clearer.

Just after the new moon, so skies will be darkest. You’ll see fewer meteors than at peak, but visibility will be much clearer. August 12–13 (Official Peak): This is when the most meteors will occur (up to 75/hour), but the 84% full moon will wash out many of them. Only the brightest streaks will be visible.

This is when the most meteors will occur (up to 75/hour), but the 84% full moon will wash out many of them. Only the brightest streaks will be visible. August 16–26 (Late Window): After the full moon fades, skies get dark again. Meteor rates drop slightly, but viewing improves. A solid second chance if you miss the peak.

Where to Stargaze in UAE

Al Awir Desert (Dubai): Not too far from the city, but remote enough for dark skies. A popular and easy-to-access stargazing spot.

Hatta (2 hours from Dubai): Mountain air, desert surroundings, and minimal light. Great for overnight trips and casual camping.

Al Quaa Desert (Abu Dhabi): One of the darkest locations in the UAE, and ideal for serious stargazing.

Viewing Tips: How to Get the Most Out of It

Avoid city lights. Head out to a desert or low-light area.

Let your eyes adjust. It takes 20-30 minutes for full night vision.

Skip the gear. No telescope needed, meteors are best seen with your eyes.

Limit phone use. Screens ruin your night vision.

Watch for at least an hour. Meteors often come in clusters, with pauses in between.

Bonus: Milky Way Viewing on July 26

FAQ

1. Do I need a telescope to see the Perseids?

If you live in the UAE and enjoy looking up at the night sky, now’s the time. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the most anticipated night-sky events of the year, has returned. Active from July 17 to August 23, it brings bright streaks of light and fast-moving meteors across the sky, often visible without any equipment.Known for fast, bright meteors, the Perseids can produce up to 100 streaks per hour during peak nights. These ""shooting stars"" come from debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle, and they burn up high in Earth’s atmosphere, putting on a natural light show.This year, the peak falls on August 12–13, but unfortunately, it coincides with a nearly full moon. That means the sky will be brighter than ideal, which could make most of the meteors harder to see. Still, there are other dates with darker skies where you can catch the show, especially in the UAE’s wide open deserts.Each year, Earth passes through a trail of dust left by Comet Swift-Tuttle. That dust hits our atmosphere at high speed (about 60 km/second) and lights up, creating what we call meteors.The shower gets its name from the Perseus constellation, which is the point in the sky where the meteors seem to come from.But you don’t need to find it, just look up anywhere in the sky and be patient.You’ll need to get away from light pollution to see anything clearly. Here are a few recommended places:Additionally, the Dubai Astronomy Group will host a stargazing event on August 12, right during the Perseid peak. The event will include expert guidance, telescope stations, and desert camping vibes. Details are coming soon, check their site or Instagram for updates.If you're into more than just meteors, there’s an extra celestial treat this month. On Saturday, July 26, the Dubai Astronomy Group is hosting a Milky Way gazing event in Al Quaa Desert, Abu Dhabi.This event is all about taking in the full arc of the Milky Way Galaxy, which will be fully visible in the dark desert sky, with no city lights in the way. Whether you’re a seasoned astrophotographer or just want to experience a quiet night under the stars, this is a great chance to connect with the night sky.The Perseids will still be active during this time, so you may even catch a few meteors too.No. Meteors are best seen without any equipment.

"UAE: No visa renewal for Dubai residents without paying traffic fines, what expats need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-no-visa-renewal-for-dubai-residents-without-paying-traffic-fines-what-expats-need-to-know/articleshow/122849381.cms,"Dubai’s new system requires residents to settle all unpaid traffic fines, either fully or via instalments, before completing visa renewals/ Image: Dubai Media Office

TL;DR



Dubai residents must clear all traffic fines before renewing or issuing residency visas, under a new pilot system by GDRFA.



The system is designed to encourage rule-following, not punish, payment in instalments is available via RTA’s Tabby platform.



It’s not fully rolled out yet and currently excludes Dubai Airport’s GDRFA centre.



RTA now allows fines and other fees to be paid digitally across apps, kiosks, and its website with flexible plans.



System Designed with Flexibility and Convenience



Policy Meant to Promote Responsibility, Not Punishment



Not a New Concept, But Now More Digitally Integrated



FAQs:







Q: Do I need to pay all my traffic fines before renewing my Dubai visa?

Q:Can I pay in instalments if my fines are high?

Q: Is this rule applied everywhere in Dubai?

Q: Where can I pay my fines digitally?





Dubai residents must now settle all outstanding traffic fines before renewing or issuing their residency visas, under a newly piloted system launched by Dubai’s immigration and road transport authorities. This initiative is being spearheaded by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) in coordination with the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA).Accoring to reports, the rule has not been rolled out universally across all government touchpoints yet but is actively being trialled at several visa service centres, excluding the GDRFA centre at Dubai Airport. The GDRFA confirmed that the system is still in the pilot phase and is being implemented gradually.This means that any Dubai resident with unpaid traffic fines will be prompted to clear them before they can complete their visa transactions. The goal, according to officials, is not to impose restrictions but to reinforce accountability and encourage lawful conduct among residents. The system has been structured to avoid disruption, allowing payment in full or through instalment plans, depending on the individual's situation.Officials say the system is intended to be fair and manageable. Residents with large pending fines can opt to pay them off in instalments. Flexibility is a key feature of the initiative, which has been developed after extensive internal reviews and the assessment of thousands of individual cases.To make the process smooth and accessible, RTA has upgraded its digital services, integrating Tabby, a payment platform, into all its digital channels. These include the RTA website, RTA app, nol Pay app, and previously installed smart kiosks. Residents can now pay for up to 170 services, including traffic fines, vehicle licence renewals, and driving licence transactions, through Tabby’s instalment system.Tabby enables users to divide their payments into up to four instalments, significantly reducing the financial burden of lump-sum fines. The feature also covers purchases of vehicle number plates, providing added convenience across a wider range of services.Authorities have emphasised that the move is not meant to penalise residents but rather to encourage them to take responsibility for their actions and adhere to local laws. GDRFA leadership underscored that individuals who wish to live and work in Dubai are expected to follow the country’s rules and regulations.Failure to clear dues could lead to complications in the future, including difficulties when trying to exit the country. For example, individuals with fines still pending after several years might face obstacles at the time of departure, potentially being stopped at immigration checkpoints.Residents who visit GDRFA centres for visa-related services will be guided through the traffic fine settlement process. Authorities have ensured that the new approach remains resident-friendly, with the system designed to inform, assist, and offer solutions, not deny services outright.This is not the first time UAE authorities have explored the idea of linking fines with residency services. As far back as 2014, the Ministry of Interior had floated a similar initiative where traffic fines were tied to visa renewal processes.However, the current system differs by providing digital convenience, wider integration, and structured payment options, all supported by RTA’s tech-driven platforms. The enhanced ease of access makes compliance far more manageable today than it may have been in previous years.As the system moves out of its pilot phase, broader implementation is expected in the coming months. Residents are advised to regularly check for any outstanding violations and resolve them early to avoid delays in their visa procedures.Yes, under the new system, you must clear outstanding fines before your visa can be renewed or issued.Yes, you can split payments using Tabby across RTA’s digital platforms.Not yet, it’s in the pilot phase and doesn’t apply at Dubai Airport’s GDRFA centre.You can use the RTA website, app, nol Pay app, or smart kiosks for digital payments.","Dubai’s new system requires residents to settle all unpaid traffic fines, either fully or via instalments, before completing visa renewals.

Peacekeeper Trains: Nukes launched from trains







War has a funny way of turning wild ideas into serious government projects. In the chaos of World War II and the paranoia of the Cold War, military minds across the globe cooked up experiments that sound less like national defense and more like fever dreams. Think remote-viewing psychics, napalm-strapped bats, pain rays, and yes, even a surgically wired CIA spy cat, code-named “Acoustikitty,” who was supposed to eavesdrop on Soviet agents but promptly wandered off. These weren’t jokes, they were fully funded, sometimes top-secret missions with real budgets and even weirder intentions.Most of these plans fizzled out, tripped up by science, common sense, or the sheer unpredictability of, say, cats. But they offer a fascinating, and often hilarious, look into what happens when military strategy meets sci-fi imagination. So if you’ve ever wondered what it looks like when serious defense programs go completely off the rails, you’re in the right place. Let’s reimagine it.In the mid-1960s, the CIA launched a curious and ambitious project known as ""Acoustikitty,"" aiming to use wired and microphoned cats to covertly eavesdrop on open-air conversations between foreign agents and their Soviet contacts.The plan involved implanting a microphone in the cat’s ear, a transmitter under its skin, and an antenna woven into its fur, allowing it to inconspicuously capture sensitive conversations in public places like parks.Despite the technology functioning as intended, the fundamental flaw lay in the cat’s unpredictable behavior, true to feline nature, it couldn’t be trained to follow specific commands or approach intended targets reliably. After several unsuccessful tests, the project was ultimately abandoned in 1967 without ever seeing operational use. Still, the story of Acoustikitty remains one of the most bizarre and enduring legends of Cold War espionage.Project Stargate was a Cold War-era US intelligence effort to explore the potential military use of psychic phenomena, especially remote viewing, the claimed ability to perceive distant or unseen targets without physical presence. Sparked by reports that the Soviet Union was heavily investing in psychic research, the CIA feared falling behind in this unconventional domain. Throughout the 1970s to 1990s, the program evolved under various codenames like SCANATE, GONDOLA WISH, and GRILL FLAME, eventually becoming known as Stargate.Supporters of Project Stargate cite cases where remote viewers allegedly identified a crashed Soviet aircraft in Africa and described hidden facilities later verified by traditional intelligence. However, critics argue these successes were overstated, noting that remote viewing often produced vague or inaccurate information and that results could not be reliably replicated under controlled conditions, casting doubt on the program’s scientific validity. By 1995, it was declassified and terminated after a review found it failed to produce consistently reliable intelligence.In 1994, a US military lab at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base proposed developing a non-lethal chemical weapon designed to disrupt enemy morale by inducing homosexual behavior among troops using a potent aphrodisiac. The idea was part of a $7.5 million funding request aimed at researching chemicals that could impair enemy discipline and cohesion without causing physical harm.Although the ""gay bomb"" proposal was ultimately rejected, it resurfaced years later when the document was disclosed through a Freedom of Information request. The watchdog group Sunshine Project publicized the bizarre and controversial plan, which highlighted the extremes explored in psychological warfare during that era.The VZ-9AV Avrocar was a Cold War-era experimental aircraft designed to function as a high-speed, stealthy flying vehicle. Developed in the 1950s with a projected budget of $3.16 million (around $26 million today), it aimed to combine vertical takeoff and landing capabilities with advanced maneuverability.Despite its ambitious goals, the Avrocar failed to deliver in testing. It could only achieve brief hovers just above the ground and proved unstable in flight. Ultimately, the project was deemed unfeasible and was canceled before reaching operational use.In an unusual World War II proposal that sounds like science fiction, a quirky American inventor suggested using bats as miniature bombers. The plan involved capturing one million bats from Texas caves, attaching small napalm charges to them, and packing them into bomb casings designed to release them mid-air over Japanese cities.Once released, the bats would instinctively roost in the wooden structures common throughout Japan at the time. A timed ignition system would then detonate the incendiaries, causing widespread fires and destruction. Though never fully implemented, the concept highlights the extreme and imaginative lengths considered in wartime strategy.Project Iceworm was an ambitious Cold War plan to build a vast network of tunnels covering 52,000 square miles beneath Greenland's ice, about three times the size of Denmark. The design included trenches spaced four miles apart to house 600 mobile nuclear missiles, along with facilities to support 11,000 soldiers living underground, prepared for a rapid strike if necessary.A 1960 top-secret US Army report praised Greenland as an ideal location, just 3,000 miles from Moscow and strategically positioned for both offensive and second-strike capabilities. The mobility and concealment of the missiles beneath the ice were intended to prevent detection and ensure retaliation in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack.Between 1950 and 1975, approximately 6,720 US service members participated in chemical exposure experiments at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. These tests involved 254 different chemicals and were primarily intended to study their effects on humans, evaluate protective gear, and assess how military personnel might respond to chemical warfare agents.Although no current tests can definitively confirm such past exposures, a thorough medical history and physical exam can help assess potential health risks. Participants may experience long-term psychological effects from the trauma of being used as test subjects, and concerned veterans are encouraged to consult healthcare providers for evaluation and support.The ""Pain Ray,"" officially known as the Active Denial System (ADS), is a non-lethal weapon developed by the US military for crowd control and perimeter defense. It works by emitting a focused beam of millimeter-wave radiation that penetrates the outer layer of skin, producing an intense burning sensation without causing permanent damage. The beam heats the skin to around 130°F (54°C), triggering an instinctive pain response that causes individuals to quickly move away from the targeted area.Designed as a safer alternative to rubber bullets or tear gas, the Pain Ray has been tested in various scenarios but has seen limited deployment due to concerns about safety, public perception, and ethical implications. Critics argue that while it may not cause lasting harm, the psychological and potential long-term effects of such a weapon remain poorly understood. Despite this, the ADS represents a significant advancement in non-lethal crowd control technology.The Camel Corps was a mid-19th-century US military experiment aimed at using camels as pack animals in the arid regions of the American Southwest. Initiated by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis in the 1850s, the program involved importing camels from the Middle East to test their effectiveness in desert conditions.Housed at Camp Verde, Texas, the camels proved to be strong, resilient, and well-suited for transporting supplies over long distances. Despite their success in field trials, the project was eventually abandoned due to the Civil War, lack of institutional support, and soldiers’ preference for traditional animals like horses and mules.Peacekeeper Trains were a Cold War-era US military concept designed to make nuclear missile launches more survivable by placing them on mobile rail platforms. The idea was to load Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) onto specially designed train cars that could travel across the national rail network, making their location unpredictable and reducing their vulnerability to a first-strike attack.By constantly moving or being deployed to remote tracks, these trains would ensure a credible second-strike capability. Although the system was tested and proven feasible, the program was never fully deployed due to high costs, logistical challenges, and arms reduction treaties.(The article uses AI generated images)","In the mid-1960s, the CIA launched a curious and ambitious project known as ""Acoustikitty,"" aiming to use wired and microphoned cats to covertly eavesdrop on foreign agents.

The Symbolism of Dates





Heritage Through the Dallah













In Oman, sharing a cup of qahwa is much more than enjoying a hot beverage. It is a deeply rooted cultural ritual that reflects the nation’s rich heritage, values of generosity, and communal warmth. From the moment it is brewed to the final pour, every step of serving qahwa is laden with symbolism, from the spices used to the way guests are addressed. Based on insights and cultural analyses, we explore how this fragrant ritual binds families, friends, and communities across the sultanate.The term qahwa (or kahwa) in Arabic simply means coffee, but in Oman the concept encompasses tradition, togetherness, and respect. According to Oman Observe, offering qahwa to guests marks the beginning of hospitality and welcomes them with open hearts. The ritual often includes serving freshly made qahwa alongside Omani dates, halwa (sweet), fruits, pastries, and sometimes nuts, creating a ceremonial spread that invites connection and conversationCulture Trip underscores this cultural pull, emphasizing that the act of preparing and serving qahwa is embedded in everyday Omani life. It is a slow, deliberate expression of generosity that defines communal identity.Unlike many global coffee styles, Omani qahwa is light in colour yet rich in aroma and flavour. It is traditionally prepared using lightly roasted beans, ground fresh with cardamom and often infused with saffron, rosewater, cloves, or cinnamon reflecting regional variation.The coffee is brewed in a dallah, a tall metal pot emblematic of Omani heritage and craftsmanship.Often shown in museum exhibits and cultural festivals as symbols of hospitality, dallahs tell the story of artisanal metalwork and enduring connection.Once brewed, qahwa is poured into small handle-less porcelain cups (finjan), filled to only one-quarter as a sign of respect and an invitation for another round. Guests signal they’ve had enough by gently shaking the cup before returning it.Guests entering an Omani home are welcomed into the majli, a gathering place for hospitality and storytelling. The host then offers dates, water to wash hands, followed by qahwa . Accepting at least one cup is customary, and refusing may be seen as disrespectful.In some households dating back generations, coffee is served before small talk; in others, the conversation precedes the pour. These subtle differences reflect Oman’s regional diversity, each area contributing its own customs to the broader tradition.Qahwa transcends home visits. It is served at business meetings, social gatherings, weddings, and religious ceremonies. In 2022, Oman hosted its first Omani Qahwa Competition during a hospitality expo, celebrating traditional preparation and encouraging its preservation. The event highlighted how coffee is not just a drink but an evolving cultural craft, passed through families, refined over generations.Service of qahwa is inseparable from dates, a staple of Omani agriculture and a sign of welcome. Dates balance the coffee’s natural bitterness and serve as a sweet overture to conversation and community. Oman is renowned for its date varieties like Khalas, Fardh, and others, each adding unique texture and flavour to the qahwa experience.The dallah is more than a functional pot, it is a symbol of Omani heritage. Exhibits like the U.S. Folklife Festival recognized Omani dallahs as cultural artefacts reflecting centuries of craftsmanship. In cities like Nizwa and Muscat, traditional metalworkers still produce dallahs by hand, preserving these techniques within local trades.Modern life in Oman blends qahwa tradition with contemporary culture. Majlis coffee corners in hotels, tourism centres, and museums now invite international guests to learn the etiquette and taste the flavours. Culinary tourism initiatives highlight such rituals, showing how Omani heritage remains alive and relevant.Omani qahwa is more than coffee; it is a sacred ritual that weaves together hospitality, history, and craftsmanship. From the careful selection of spice-infused brews to the artful preparation in ornate dallahs, every element speaks to Omani values of generosity, respect, and social unity. As Oman opens its doors to visitors and continues to promote its cultural heritage, the deep-rooted tradition of qahwa remains at the heart, proving that in Oman, every cup tells a story of warmth and connection.","In Oman, sharing a cup of qahwa is much more than enjoying a hot beverage. It is a deeply rooted cultural ritual that reflects the nation’s rich heritage, values of generosity, and communal warmth. From the moment it is brewed to the final pour, every step is laden with symbolism, from the spices used to how guests are addressed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122813077,width-400,resizemode-4/122813077.jpg"

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Teams from the Mumbai fire brigade, Police, HAZMAT unit, 108 Ambulance services, and ward staff were immediately mobilized.HAZMAT is a specialized unit trained to handle dangerous substances like toxic chemicals, gases, biological agents, or radioactive materials.Emergency responders equipped with 25 breathing apparatus (BA) kits shut off 15 to 16 valves to prevent further leakage. Simultaneously, personnel in chemical suits from the HAZMAT unit worked to stop the leak directly at the faulty valve. Sealant from Hazmat vehicles was used to plug the leak.To neutralize the escaping ammonia, fire officials deployed three high-pressure first aid lines and a small hose line connected to a four-motor pump. Around 15–20 kg of residual ammonia gas, mixed with Prizol 68 lubricant oil, was safely transferred to another reservoir tank.The area was cordoned off as a safety measure to avoid exposure. No injuries were reported in the incident.Further investigation is underway to determine the cause of the valve failure and assess any long-term risks associated with the leak.","A significant ammonia gas leak occurred at the Mahananda Dairy plant in Goregaon (East) on July 23. The leak, originating from a faulty valve in a 3,000-kilogram capacity tank, was contained. No injuries were reported in the incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122872972,imgsize-750930,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122872972.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

What Bee CEO said about Amazon’s acquisition



“Bee is joining Amazon and we couldn’t be more excited!

When we started Bee, we imagined a world where AI is truly personal, where your life is understood and enhanced by technology that learns with you.

What began as a dream with an incredible team and community now finds a new home at Amazon.

Ethan and I couldn’t think of better partners to help us bring truly personal, agentic AI to even more customers.

Thank you to everyone who believed in us: our users, investors, and the entire Bee team. You made this milestone possible.

Huge gratitude to Panos Panay and Nick Komorous for championing our vision and guiding us through this journey.”

How Bee’s AI device works



“cares deeply”

“We’ve been strong stewards of customer data since our founding, and have never been in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others. We design our products to protect our customers’ privacy and security and to make it easy for them to be in control of their experience — and this approach would of course apply to Bee,”
