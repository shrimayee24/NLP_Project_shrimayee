A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed Kelce's generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Travis Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Travis Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact. Whether motivated by love, strategy, or genuine goodwill, one thing is clear: lives in Kansas City will be changed for the better.","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula.

Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one. This strain gives the consumers anti-gravity and glowing effects.$165 base, up to $200 with negotiationsThis strain has a 100% Addiction rating, making it among the highest rated in the game. The downside is that the right ingredients take grinding before you can sell it. However, until you get there, once you start selling, the NPC gets addicted quickly and you get to reap the benefits.~$160Though not as strong as the Green Crack-based strains, it’s still a good mid-game option. The consistent customer demand provides a secure source of income, and it can be a substitute for the premium-grade ingredients if you’re running low.$140–$160 per unitThis strain is a reliable option—not the most eye-catching or the most costly, but it provides consistent sales at little cost of concern.

Kayla Nicole’s journey from being judged to being empowered

Welcome to The Pre-Game

Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce , shedding light on how not just he but other past partners treated her harshly. In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success. In a recent episode, she recalled a college relationship with a then-NBA hopeful a man she supported, only to have him dim her own ambitions in return. It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, she said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. She stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.","Kayla Nicole is opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success.

GTA 6: Likely launch timeline

GTA 6: Likely features

Dual Protagonists: For the first time, GTA will feature a female protagonist, Lucia, alongside a male character. This dual-character storyline adds depth and variety to the narrative. Massive Open World: The game is set in the fictional state of Leonida, inspired by Florida, and includes Vice City. Players can explore diverse environments like urban cities, beaches, swamps, and small towns. Enhanced Graphics: Expect cutting-edge visuals with ray tracing, volumetric clouds, and realistic reflections, making the game world more immersive2. Smarter AI: NPCs will have improved reactions, making the world feel alive. Police behavior is also expected to be more intelligent, introducing new stealth mechanics for evading law enforcement. Expanded Gameplay Mechanics: The Wanted system will be revamped, and new features like realistic physics and advanced character customization are anticipated3. Enterable Interiors: Leaks suggest that players will have access to a wide range of interiors, adding depth to exploration and gameplay.

The gaming community is abuzz after a Swiss retailer briefly listed the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 ( GTA 6 ) for pre-order at 99 Swiss Francs, approximately $112 USD.

Others, however, are less enthusiastic, with many taking to social media to voice their frustration. ""At $112, I'll wait for a sale,"" one fan posted on Reddit, echoing the sentiment of many.Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, have yet to confirm the official pricing for GTA 6. Speculation remains rife, with some suggesting the listing could have been a placeholder or a marketing tactic to gauge public reaction. Regardless, the potential price hike has sparked concerns about setting a new precedent for future AAA game pricing.GTA 6 is slated for release in Fall 2025, with rumors suggesting a PC version may follow in 2026. The game is expected to feature a massive open-world map inspired by modern-day Florida, dual protagonists, and enhanced gameplay mechanics.

Here's what fans can expect:","A Swiss retailer briefly listed the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 ( GTA 6 ) for pre-order at 99 Swiss Francs, approximately $112 USD. The leaked price, if accurate, would mark a significant departure from the standard $70 price tag for most next-gen AAA games. Fans have expressed mixed reactions, with some justifying the premium cost due to the game's rumoured expansive open world, cutting-edge graphics, and years of development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120054036,imgsize-1798175,width-400,resizemode-4/Will-GTA-6-have-a-dynamic-economy-How-prices-could-change-over-time.jpg"

Poll Should archaeological sites be preserved for historical and religious significance? Only if funds are available Absolutely, they are vital

Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden, aligning with biblical accounts . The excavation has revealed seeds and pollen from olive trees and grapevines, potentially dating back around 2,000 years.The discovery supports a passage in the New Testament, John 19:41, which states, ""Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.""Francesca Stasolla , an archaeology professor at the Sapienza University of Rome, confirmed the findings and emphasized their significance in an interview with Fox News Digital. She explained that the organic material was discovered in layers from a time when the site transitioned from a quarry to a funerary location.""The quarry had to be gradually abandoned and as the stone extraction ended it was used for agricultural areas and tombs,"" Stasolla said. ""This must have been what it looked like in the 1st century AD""Excavations at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre mark the first major restoration project at the revered Christian site in nearly two centuries. The work is taking place in areas shared by different religious communities .The site itself has a long and complex history. Originally built in 326 AD, the church was destroyed in 1009 AD under the orders of Islamic ruler al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. It was later reconstructed by Christian Crusaders in the 12th century.""The current church is that of the Crusader reconstruction, but the whole church is a composition of historical phases from the fourth century to the modern age,"" Stasolla explained.The area’s religious and historical importance is evident in the many artifacts found during the excavation. Objects dating as far back as the Iron Age, including ceramics, metal, and glass, offer evidence of the site's long history as a place of worship.""Ceramics, metals, glass… [all] document both the occupation of the area and the presence of believers and pilgrims,"" Stasolla noted, adding that the goal of the excavation is to deepen understanding of the region’s religious significance.When asked whether the recent findings reinforce the biblical reference to a garden at the site of Christ’s crucifixion, Stasolla acknowledged the connection while clarifying the role of archaeology.""Archaeology provides us with data that must then be historicized and interpreted,"" she said. ""In this case, it documents an agricultural use of the quarry… [the Bible quote] is certainly suggestive [of this].""The excavation remains ongoing, and according to Stasolla, more discoveries are expected. ""It is certainly a strategic excavation for the knowledge of the development of the city and its process of sacralization in a Christian key,"" she said.","Archaeologists working at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem have uncovered evidence of an ancient garden.

Belief in witchcraft spreads worldwide



Scapegoats for calamity



In a parallel universe



Witches as figureheads for feminists



Different kinds of magic



Parallels between belief in witches and conspiracy theories?



Witchcraft is not a game



""I'm a modern witch, I admit it,"" says 59-year-old Barbara. She has spent her entire life feeling that she is in contact with the spirit world. Her room smells of incense, and she's about to consult the runes for her future. In the Early Modern period, Barbara would likely have ended up burned at the stake.This fate also threatened Maria Anna Schwegelin, for the people wanted to see the former maid burned in April 1775. She had confessed to fornication with the devil. Maria Anna Schwegelin was the last witch to be sentenced to death in Germany, in the Bavarian town of Kempten , even though leading thinkers and authorities no longer truly believed in witchcraft in the Age of Enlightenment. However, they didn't want to disappoint the people, who were still deeply mired in superstition.It wasn't until 1995 that a historian discovered that the sentence was never carried out. Maria Anna Schwegelin died in prison in 1781.Whether the supposed witch truly met the devil or was mentally disturbed remains a mystery. What is certain, however, is that even in the 21st century, there are still people who believe in witchcraft. Barbara is by no means the only one.According to ""Witchcraft Beliefs around the World: An Exploratory Analysis,"" a global study released in November by economist Boris Gershman of American University in Washington, D.C., a remarkable 40% of the global population across 95 countries is convinced that witches exist.That figure fluctuates from country to country: In Tunisia, it is around 90%, in Germany just 13%. The authors of the study also define those who believe in the evil eye and in curses as ""believers in witches.""Barbara, however, doesn't want to put a curse on anyone, she told DW emphatically: ""This classic image of a witch sneaking out at night, flying on a broom and conjuring up something evil for people, that's of course total nonsense.""For centuries, many people, especially women, fell victim to this notion of the witch, and particularly between about 1450 and 1750 in Europe. Whatever the misfortune — disease, dead livestock, failed harvests, a failed business — a scapegoat was needed. This was common in the past, but still exists today in some countries.""Similar ideas of witchcraft to those of the early modern period actually exist today in other parts of the world as an explanation for calamity,"" ethnologist Iris Gareis told DW. ""Unfortunately, for decades people believed to be sorcerers or witches have been killed in a cruel way in many parts of the world.""While in countries such as Tanzania or Ghana women accused of witchcraft have to seek refuge in so-called witch camps to escape death, some people in the northern hemisphere openly profess to witchcraft.For example, Justin (name changed): ""As a child, you learn about the witch in the Hansel and Gretel story, as the evil one who eats up the good. And at some point, you address that notion and learn to see the witch as a wise woman."" Justin is a self-professed follower of Wicca — a neo-pagan religious movement named after the Old English word for witch.""Hexe,"" the German word for witch, is derived from the Old High German ""hagazussa,"" which means fence-rider. Someone who can see into other worlds, says Justin, and can bring magic into their own life or that of other people. Spirits and magical rituals help him, he says, adding that for him Christianity lacked that sense of magic for him and he never felt at home in that religion.Barbara likewise did not feel at home in the Christian Church. As a witch, she is a follower of natural religions, she says. She talks to trees, and uses a drum to come into contact with spirits and go into a trance. She says that she learned to do this from a shaman. ""The witchcraft universe is rich and colorful. You live a little bit here and a little bit in a parallel world.""While many modern witches read tarot cards, Barbara prefers to use runes as to predict the future. ""Why should I wait for the powers of fate to give me something?"" she asks. ""If I ask a question, the answer is sure to come."" She also always has incense and plant extracts at home — to combat illness. ""It all sounds like herbalism. But it's supposed to sound like it, too, because that's what witchcraft used to be all about, knowing herbs and healing people.""But from a historical perspective, the image of the witch as a wise woman with special knowledge as a healer and midwife is nothing more than a cliche, says ethnologist Iris Gareis. ""The women who were persecuted as witches were not always some great herbalists, but mostly quite normal people. And they didn't always have red hair, as is often claimed. That's total nonsense and doesn't appear in any historical document."" However, the image has become so entrenched in people's minds that it often cannot be countered even with scientific evidence, she points out.The phenomenon of modern witches is closely linked to the women's movement of the 1970s, which rebelled against the dominance of the male world. ""In the witch, they had a figurehead, so to speak,"" says Gareis. ""Of course, these feminists were not witch researchers. They were just normal, even intellectual women who just appropriated this image of the oppressed woman.""In the 1980s, the spiritual aspect was added to this image. It was especially urban women who were attracted to nature-based religions, the ethnologist says. ""What I can imagine is that in times of uncertainty, people seek their salvation in nature.""While many modern witches in urban metropolises do not belong to any group, but Wiccans organize themselves in circles.The Wiccan cult originated in Britain in the first half of the 20th century and is recognized as a religion there, as it is in the US. Justin completed his own initiation ritual years ago.""Some say you have to put a pointy black hat on a witch so that she can be recognized as such,"" Justin said. ""I personally like to surprise people by not draping myself with charms and talismans. And then — boom — something unexpected and magical comes from me.""""That's my little wicked witch community,"" he adds, with a twinkle in his eye.In no way, however, does he want to harm anyone, he says. But he is convinced, as is Barbara, that there are witches with dark intentions: ""There are magicians who cast curses and spells with which they can definitely achieve something.""According to the Gershman study, the belief in witchcraft is less widespread among well-educated and economically sound people but iris Gareis is not so sure: ""In view of modern conspiracy theories, which became especially apparent during the Covid pandemic in the US, and also here in Germany, that is doubtful.""After all, she points out that there are even educated people who believe that reptiloids, or lizard people, live among us and control events in politics and the economy — something that is incomprehensible to her.Justin warns against getting involved with witchcraft if you don't have your feet on the ground: ""People who are mentally unstable should stay away from magic and sorcery. If they can't get their lives under control, they won't find a way to balance themselves through witchcraft or Wicca. If I am not grounded, then I cannot reach out and explore the heavens.""Or to quote Shakespeare's Hamlet, ""There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""","40% of the global population across 95 countries is convinced that witches exist. In Tunisia, it is around 90%, in Germany just 13%. Study defines those who believe in the evil eye and in curses as ""believers in witches"" Some people in the northern hemisphere openly profess to witchcraft.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120090806,imgsize-1013219,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-49.jpg"

In, perhaps the finest popular novel on parallels between modern physics and “Eastern mysticism”, author Fritjof Capra sums up the dichotomy by stating: “Socrates in Greece made the famous statement ‘I know that I know nothing,’ and Lao Tzu in China said, ‘Not knowing that one knows is best.’” The two views encapsulate the civilisational split in how complexity is perceived — and explain why Western minds, even their best ones, struggle with concepts like relativity, duality, and of course, Donald Trump For over a decade, commentators have tried — and failed — to explain Trump. They’ve overanalysed the polls, underestimated the rallies, and overdosed on coastal smugness. They still can’t fathom how this man keeps winning hearts, minds, and became the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote. The root of their confusion may lie even deeper: a Newtonian worldview shaped by centuries of Abrahamic certainty — one in which Galileo is forced to apologise for describing the basic framework of the universe, forcing Bhojpuri music artistes to pay tribute to his immortal line E pur si muove (“But it moves”) in numerous songs likee. A worldview obsessed with levers, with cause-and-effect, with clean inputs and predictable outputs, simply cannot explain Trump, any more than the choreographer of Nach Baliye can solve string theory with a dance sequence.Every time an economist tries to explain Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” — which have spared neither man nor beast — an atom gets confused, spins backwards, and applies for asylum in Canada. That’s not a metaphor. That’s quantum panic. Trying to model Trump with classical economics is like trying to decode Bhojpuri lyrics using German syntax — structurally fascinating, semantically pointless.Trump is not a macroeconomic actor. He is not a supply-side theorist. Trump is a wave and a particle with a spray tan, a Keynesian-Friedmanite who would have driven Sir Humphrey Appleby to early retirement. He is the flutter of a butterfly wing that created a tornado, which then consumed — and continues to cannibalise — the Republican Party and American conservatism as a whole. He exists in multiple states until observed — billionaire populist, law-and-order anarchist, capitalist protectionist. And when observed too closely? He tweets, collapses into pure energy, and launches policies that somehow punish both Canada and America, often simultaneously and with equal conviction.Economic theory breaks down because it relies on assumptions: rational actors, measurable outcomes, and something resembling a utility curve. But Trump operates in a realm where contradiction is not failure — it is form. Where economists seek optimisation, Trump seeks vibes. He doesn’t want results. He wants resonance. He doesn’t target imbalances — he targets feelings, slights, headlines, and charts that slope in the wrong direction. His approach to trade is not about equilibrium or surplus. It is emotional release dressed as policy. His thinking is not linear. It is entangled. Interdependent.Non-local. It is the very thing Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.”Quantum mechanics, unlike economics, has no problem with Trump. In fact, it was made for him. It accepts that multiple truths can exist simultaneously. That particles can be in two places at once. That measuring something changes it. That an action in Iowa can ripple through Shanghai without any obvious chain of cause. Trump, likewise, is a superposition — impeached and invincible, clown and messiah, conman and cosmic joke. His policies appear and vanish. His meanings collapse upon scrutiny. His very presence changes the system observing him.Even relativity, with its distortion of time and space based on vantage point, might help us understand why watching Trump from New York makes him look like a buffoon, while watching him from West Virginia makes him look like a prophet. There is no universal frame of reference with Trump. There is only position, momentum, and the observer’s faith in whichever truth makes them feel momentarily less anxious about the universe.And so we come to the trade deficit — to economists, a banal statistic. But to Trump, a moral failure. A sign that someone, somewhere, has gotten one over on America. And so he opens the box, sees the deficit, declares the cat dead, and slaps a tariff on the cat, the box, and the intern who ran the numbers. That the cat may be alive in some parallel economic dimension is irrelevant. The gesture is what matters. The performance. The quantum ritual. Because for Trump, tariffs are not corrective tools. They are karmic theatre. They do not exist to balance books. They exist to imbalance expectations.Which is why every economist sounds like a therapist these days. “He’s not responding to incentives.” “He might be projecting onto the Canadian dairy lobby.” “He’s seeking psychic closure through retaliatory policy.” But economic theory cannot quantify vibes. It cannot model retribution. It cannot simulate the physics of trolling. And so it collapses — again and again — under the weight of a reality that refuses to obey.Trump does not follow Newton’s laws. He follows no law. He follows resonance. And when you finally grasp it — the spin, the entanglement, the emotional equation scribbled in Sharpie on an Air Force One napkin — you realise: Trump is the cat. Trump is the box. Trump is the guy charging the cat a 10% import fee for entering the box.In fact, it’s hard not to think of another Donald in this particular context. When pressed about George Bush’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction.Or to quote another Donald, in this case Donald Rumsfeld, George Bush’s Secretary of Defence, who delivered a line that would been more at home in 1911 Solvay Conference than a Pentagon press briefing, when pressed about non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq:Or to borrow a pithier and earthier line from a Salman Khan film:","Trump is not a macroeconomic actor, he is not supply-side theorist.

Scientists: Dire wolf brought back from extinction after 13,000 years

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has a request pet woolly mammoth after US biotech company Colossal Biosciences revealed it had successfully created dire wolf pups—an extinct species.“Please make a miniature pet wooly mammoth,” Musk wrote on X. His post included two photos- a Time Magazine cover showing a wolf-like animal with the title “Extinct” crossed out at the top, and two wolf pups sitting on the iron throne, inspired by Game of Thrones — the series that helped popularise the extinct species.The internet responded to his tweet with AI-generated memes of Musk walking a baby mammoth on a leash, him flying on the back of a dinosaur, and more.The Dallas-based biotech firm Colossal Biosciences Inc announced it had created three dire wolf pups—animals that have been extinct for over 12,000 years. It had already announced in 2022 its ambitious effort to bring back the woolly mammoth.Named Remus, Romulus, and Khaleesi, the wolf pups are living in a secret US location. They eat beef, deer, and horse meat, along with a special kibble. The male pups are currently 20–25% larger than normal grey wolves of their age and are expected to weigh up to 140 pounds as adults.Colossal gained global attention in 2022 for its ambitious effort to bring back the woolly mammoth. So far, the closest they’ve come is creating a genetically altered mouse with mammoth traits.The company’s research also includes work on reviving the dodo and Tasmanian tiger.While Colossal claims the gene-editing technologies can help in conservation and health care , many scientists remain sceptical. The startup has attracted funding and high-profile backers like Paris Hilton and Tony Robbins, who have already seen returns through Colossal’s spinoff ventures.","US biotech company Colossal Biosciences revealed it had successfully created dire wolf pups.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Encrypted messaging by DOGE staff raises transparency alarms

Role of Grok AI in government operations

DOGE’s influence at the EPA and other federal agencies

Operational control and data access restrictions

Ethical and legal implications

In a rapidly evolving and politically charged environment, the fusion of artificial intelligence and federal governance is raising profound ethical, legal, and operational concerns. At the center of this unfolding development is Elon Musk ’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE )—a tech-centric initiative launched under the Trump administration that aims to revolutionize the federal bureaucracy.According to multiple sources with direct knowledge, DOGE has allegedly begun using advanced AI systems to monitor internal communications within at least one U.S. federal agency. The objective, reportedly, is to identify sentiments perceived as disloyal to former President Donald Trump or contrary to DOGE's reformist agenda. This effort is accompanied by the use of private communication apps like Signal, and experimental deployment of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot, marking an unprecedented shift in how surveillance and administrative control are exercised within the federal government.Several sources familiar with the matter revealed that federal employees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were informed by Trump-appointed officials that their internal communications might be monitored using artificial intelligence. These tools, according to insiders, are trained to detect language that may be hostile toward Elon Musk or Donald Trump. This type of targeted surveillance, if confirmed, represents a significant departure from traditional methods of federal oversight and personnel management.Employees were reportedly warned to “be careful what you say, what you type and what you do,” with the clear implication that digital communications—including chat platforms like Microsoft Teams—could be scrutinized for ideological alignment with the administration’s priorities.DOGE staff members are allegedly relying heavily on Signal, an encrypted messaging application that supports self-deleting messages. While this app is often praised for privacy and cybersecurity, its use within a federal setting—especially for official communication—raises red flags regarding compliance with federal record-keeping laws.Government ethics expert Kathleen Clark from Washington University in St. Louis expressed concern that DOGE’s reliance on Signal could violate federal regulations. “If they’re using Signal and not backing up every message to federal files, then they are acting unlawfully,” Clark said. The use of non-traceable communication in governance has reignited debates about the transparency obligations of federal employees, especially those operating within or alongside politically appointed teams.Another key component of DOGE's operations appears to be the use of “Grok,” an AI-powered chatbot developed under Musk’s AI ventures. Though the exact nature of Grok’s usage within the federal apparatus remains unclear, sources suggest it is being “heavily” deployed to support DOGE’s mission of downsizing government operations.While Grok’s deployment could represent an effort to modernize administrative workflows, experts warn that unregulated AI integration in governance could pave the way for biased decision-making, automation without oversight, and data misuse. There are also significant questions around the lack of transparency in Grok's role and access to sensitive government data.DOGE’s operational reach is becoming increasingly evident in agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, where nearly 600 employees were placed on administrative leave in early 2025. The agency also announced a planned 65% budget cut. Internal communications hint that AI tools might be used not just to monitor sentiment, but to inform decisions regarding layoffs, resource allocation, and internal audits.The EPA later confirmed it was exploring AI to “optimize agency functions and administrative efficiencies,” but denied using AI in personnel decisions. Still, the overlap between DOGE’s mission and staffing changes has prompted widespread speculation about the use of AI-driven analytics to target staff deemed misaligned with Trump-era priorities.DOGE’s commitment to secrecy has led to several legal and procedural concerns. In addition to using Signal, staff are reportedly bypassing standard document circulation procedures by editing sensitive materials directly within Google Docs. This creates a scenario where multiple individuals can make simultaneous changes without leaving an official revision trail—a practice that undermines records management protocols.Citing this “unusual secrecy,” a federal judge ordered DOGE on March 10 to begin turning over internal documents to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government watchdog group. As of March 24, no documents had been handed over.Court documents reveal that DOGE has taken administrative control of sensitive digital infrastructure in various federal bodies. When the team assumed oversight of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2025, OPM employees were locked out of databases containing personal data of tens of millions of current and former federal workers.Sources state that access to the cloud where vital government applications are hosted has been restricted to just two individuals: one career OPM staff member and Greg Hogan, a Trump appointee and former AI startup executive now serving as the OPM’s Chief Information Officer. This centralization of access and power has contributed to a growing narrative that DOGE is not just restructuring government—it is isolating and insulating itself from traditional oversight.Elon Musk, while operating as a special government employee, is subject to ethics laws that prohibit involvement in government decisions that could benefit his private ventures. Nevertheless, critics argue that his proximity to government infrastructure and DOGE’s control over digital platforms create inherent conflicts of interest.Further, the lack of clarity on who controls DOGE’s directives, combined with evasive communication strategies, has raised red flags among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Although the initiative is pitched as a cost-cutting reform to eliminate government waste, the secrecy, personnel purges, and opaque AI deployment have sparked concerns about political targeting and suppression of dissent.","Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) has allegedly begun using advanced AI systems to monitor internal communications within at least one U.S. federal agency.
