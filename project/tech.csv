In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"
“Dumbest sh*t”: Antonio Brown ridicules proposed Charlie Kirk coin legislation while demanding Epstein files be released,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dumbest-sht-antonio-brown-ridicules-proposed-charlie-kirk-coin-legislation-while-demanding-epstein-files-be-released/articleshow/124137910.cms,"Antonio Brown & Charlie Kirk (Getty Images)

Antonio Brown slams Charlie Kirk coin proposal and demands focus on Epstein files

Antonio Brown says real issues are being sidelined

Fans echo frustration with political priorities

Antonio Brown has turned his attention from football fields to Capitol Hill debates, blasting lawmakers over a proposed Charlie Kirk silver coin. The former NFL star called the idea “the dumbest” distraction, arguing that Congress is avoiding bigger issues. Brown insists the real priority should be releasing the Epstein files, a demand echoing public frustration.Antonio Brown, the outspoken former NFL star, is once again making headlines—this time for calling out lawmakers over a bizarre new proposal. Reports surfaced that legislation is being filed in the U.S. House to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins in 2026 featuring conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.The planned coins would reportedly include the phrase “well done, good and faithful servant” on one side, with Kirk’s face on the other. The proposal even goes so far as to designate them as legal tender.Brown, who has built a reputation for sharp and sometimes controversial social commentary, wasted no time responding on X (formerly Twitter). He mocked the idea with a pointed message: “They’re doing literally the dumbest sh*t you can possibly think of just to avoid releasing the Epstein files 😂”For Brown, the coin legislation isn’t just unnecessary—it’s a distraction from something much larger.His call to release the Epstein files highlights a broader public frustration over government transparency. Many Americans believe these documents could reveal powerful names tied to one of the most infamous scandals of the last decade.Brown’s reaction taps into this sentiment, questioning why lawmakers spend time on symbolic gestures rather than addressing issues that could expose corruption and deliver long-awaited accountability.Brown’s comments struck a chord online, with many echoing his concerns that Washington often focuses on political theater rather than substantive action. To his critics, the coin proposal seems like an odd attempt to elevate a media figure while ignoring pressing matters.Also Read: Antonio Brown slams late-night shows such as The Daily Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live for political bias in viral post By turning the spotlight back to the Epstein files, Antonio Brown not only mocked the legislation but also amplified a conversation that continues to resonate with the public. His trademark bluntness may ruffle feathers, but it reflects a growing impatience with how priorities are set in the nation’s capital.","Antonio Brown calls proposed Charlie Kirk silver coin ""the dumbest"" distraction.

"Dash for proof, but can you swear by it?: Delhi drivers use dashcams to settle traffic disputes safely",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/dash-for-proof-but-can-you-swear-by-it-delhi-drivers-use-dashcams-to-settle-traffic-disputes-safely/articleshow/124143493.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Everything is calm as you drive late at night on a quiet Delhi street - until a scooter suddenly cuts across your car. You slam the brakes, your heart racing. For a moment, you picture the worst. What if the rider is injured? What if someone blamed you? What if it became your word against everyone else's?For Rejimon CK, founder of Dwarka Forum and resident of Sector 22, this was a real scenario in Dec when his car collided with a two-wheeler. The riders got aggressive and blamed him. But Rejimon had a dashcam recording and the footage showed exactly what happened. ""I used it to file a police complaint,"" he said.Though he has been using a recording device placed on his car dashboard for only two years, he had also rigged up his old phone as a dashcam for five years. ""In an accident, it's important to have proof. I now use both front and rear cams. Once a car hit me from behind, and again the dashcam proved I wasn't at fault. It also rids you of guilt when you know you're right,"" he said.Rejimon's experience highlights a reality on city roads. This year, there has been a daily average of 15 accidents, some fatal, others causing injuries. Four-wheelers may be at fault more often, but not every crash is so clear.That is where a dashcam can change the narrative.But the question is: should every car have a dashcam? ""These devices can be very useful in forensics if the footage survives a crash because it can help establish the cause of accidents and is admissible as electronic evidence in court. People should use dashcams,"" suggested professor Triveni Singh, an ex-IPS officer.Cyberlaw expert Dr Karnnika A Seth, a Supreme Court advocate, confirmed that dashcam footage was admissible in court under Section 63 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, which recognises electronic records as documents if certain conditions are met. ""The device must be reliable, the recording untampered. A certificate explaining how the footage was created and stored is required,"" she explained, adding that a forensic expert's affidavit, along with the user's affidavit, is necessary. According to her, if these conditions are satisfied, such footage can serve as strong evidence in accident and insurance disputes.But, Singh added, ""Low-quality devices are risky since the data may not be retrievable or verifiable, rendering it inadmissible. I've seen cases where clear footage proved the other party's fault, showing their value. More people should use dashcams, but only good-quality ones, ideally with automatic cloud backup to avoid data loss.""A dashcam is an idea still catching up but there are many who testify to its usefulness. Rajeev Kakaria of Greater Kailash I said, ""I've been using a dashcam for years. In the city, it protects me from road rage or traffic disputes, and in the mountains, I use it to capture scenic drives. Once a cop flagged me down after the light turned red mid-way. The moment I showed him my dashcam footage, he had to let me go.""Dashcams have also captured incidents that went viral online. A hit-and-run on the Defence Colony-Lajpat Nagar flyover sparked outrage after a reckless Swift driver crashed into an auto and nearly hit a scooter before speeding away. Another motorist shared his dashcam footage on Reddit, bringing public attention to the reckless driving. As a traffic officer admitted, ""In some cases, motorists do share dashcam footage. Any form of surveillance assists and adds value to the investigation.""Dashcams are impartial - they record everything. If the driver is at fault, the footage can be used against them. They record speeding beyond the limit, rash driving, signal jumps and distracted driving. Anil Chikara, a transport expert, said, ""These devices don't just help check the behaviour of other drivers, but also encourage self-discipline since the driver knows he or she can be held accountable for a mistake. ""With GPS features, they log exact speed and location, providing clarity in disputes. Dashcams protect the innocent and expose violators alike. However, there's a catch: most dashcams automatically overwrite old footage after a few days, depending on the installed memory card's storage capacity. Drivers who want to preserve evidence longer need to download the recordings or back them up externally on a computer, memory card or cloud storage.There are different types of dashcams. Some record only the front view, while others capture both the front and rear, which many drivers prefer for its wider coverage. Dealers say awareness is growing, but the trend is uneven. Mid-range models cost Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000 and offer features like high-quality video and GPS tracking. Many car brands, including Hyundai and Toyota, now offer dashcams as accessories. Those with advanced sensors can record clearly even in low light.A seller added, ""Dashcams do more than capture video of accidents. They help with insurance claims, protect parked cars, settle road rage or traffic disputes and encourage safer driving.""As the trend catches on, industry is racing to keep up, turning what was once a niche accessory into a booming business. As per an Economic Times report, the business, valued at just over Rs 887 crore in 2023, is projected to cross Rs 3,106 crore by 2032, growing at an annual rate of 15-18%. Adoption could reach 5% of car owners within the next two to three years.","Dashcams can be very useful in forensics if the footage survives a crash.

Theme execution over superficial references: It’s not enough to attach a theme name. Judges will look for depth — does your film really “rewrite tomorrow” with new ideas, or does it just slap on futuristic visuals? Does “The Secret Life Of” go deeper than just showing something hidden does it evoke empathy, surprise, insight?



Language / subtitles: English subtitles are required even if your dialogue is in another language. Poor subtitle translation or missing subtitles can hurt.



One entry per individual: While some sources say one entry per individual, others allow multiple entries (but maybe in different genres?). You’ll need to double-check this in the full criteria.



Public vote matters: Being shortlisted means you’ll go through public voting. So a film that appeals to audiences (not just art/AI enthusiasts) may have an edge. Think about clarity, emotional hook, shareability.

New UAE school rules 2025: What parents must know about the ban on online food deliveries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-uae-school-rules-2025-what-parents-must-know-about-the-ban-on-online-food-deliveries/articleshow/124063276.cms,"Schools across the UAE have introduced a new rule: no more online food deliveries for students during school hours. Food apps like Talabat, Noon and Deliveroo can no longer drop meals at school gates, with education authorities pushing the change to improve child nutrition and safety.





UAE schools ban online food deliveries: New rules, dates and who is affected



Why UAE schools stopped food delivery apps: Health, safety and academic reasons



Nutrition and health: Most app-ordered meals are fast food, high in fat, sugar and salt, and not aligned with UAE health standards. Limiting deliveries helps promote balanced eating habits.

Food safety: Unlike school canteens, delivery food doesn’t undergo municipal or health inspections. This raises risks of poor handling, contamination, or undeclared allergens.

Student focus: Ordering and receiving food during school hours disrupts lessons. Authorities highlight that well-planned meals improve focus, energy and classroom performance.

Security and safeguarding: Limiting who can access school premises reduces unnecessary outside interaction, ensuring a safer environment for children.

How UAE schools will enforce the online food delivery ban and what parents should do



No app deliveries accepted: Schools will no longer accept food from delivery drivers, even if parents place an order.

Parent handover only: If a child forgets their lunch, parents can bring food to the school reception. In some schools, parents must also sign an undertaking form.

Canteens as the primary source: Approved canteens that meet Dubai Municipality, ADEK and Ministry of Health guidelines will provide meals, ensuring no student is left without food.

Special dietary needs: Parents of children with allergies or medical conditions are encouraged to coordinate directly with the school to make arrangements.

Healthy lunchbox ideas and parent tips after UAE school delivery ban



Plan the night before: Pack lunches in the evening to save morning stress.

Aim for balance: Include protein (eggs, chicken, hummus), whole-grain carbs (brown bread, wraps, rice), fruits, and vegetables.

Hydrate smartly: Send a reusable water bottle instead of sugary drinks.

Label containers: Add your child’s name and class to avoid mix-ups.

Involve children: Let them choose snacks or help pack to reduce fussiness.

Check with canteens: Schools are open to providing alternatives if students have dietary restrictions.

Chicken and avocado wrap + carrot sticks + apple slices

Hummus with whole-grain pita + cucumber and tomato salad + orange

Yogurt with granola + boiled egg + berries

What’s next: Compliance, canteens and parent concerns







Schools across the UAE have moved to stop online food deliveries to students during school hours, citing child safety and a push to promote healthier eating habits. Abu Dhabi’s Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) led the change ahead of the new school year, and several major school groups in Dubai have issued circulars telling parents that delivery apps such as Talabat and Noon are not allowed.Abu Dhabi’s education authority introduced updated nutrition rules that explicitly prohibit external food deliveries to schools during operating hours, with the policy taking effect from the start of the academic year on 25 August 2025. The directive forms part of broader measures to tighten school nutrition policies across the emirate.In Dubai and other Emirates, leading school operators (including GEMS and several private schools) have circulated similar internal notices: online delivery services are strictly not allowed, and some schools require parents who bring food to do so in person at reception and sign an undertaking form. Examples named in reporting include Talabat and Noon among the banned delivery options.Authorities cite several key reasons for banning deliveries:The new rules are being enforced through several measures:For parents, the shift means planning ahead and avoiding reliance on quick app orders.To adapt to the new policy, parents can focus on simple, balanced and easy-to-prepare meals. Practical tips include:Example lunchbox combos:The ban is expected to bring smoother meal management in schools, but it also comes with questions from parents. Some worry about picky eaters, time pressures at home, or affordability of canteen food. Schools and education authorities are assuring parents that canteens will continue to improve menus to make meals healthier and more appealing, No child will go hungry; schools will provide alternatives if lunches are forgotten, Feedback channels remain open so parents can raise concerns about menu choices or dietary needs. Ultimately, the initiative is less about limiting choice and more about building healthier habits, safer campuses, and stronger focus in classrooms.","Schools across the UAE have introduced a new rule: no more online food deliveries for students during school hours.

NAVI MUMBAI: Brinda Miller, fine artist and chairperson of Kala Ghoda Association, said artificial intelligence (AI) will be much in use even in the traditional way of textile making in India, which is good, but it can have a few detrimental effects. Miller, who was addressing students of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) at their Kharghar campus, said art and textiles have long been interwoven since ancient India, and now AI will be added on to embellish this evolving fabric.This was a part of the lecture series of TOI on Campus, and the topic at NIFT was 'The Art And Science Of Textiles'.""Before becoming an artist, I had studied textiles at the J J School of Art in Mumbai around 40 years ago. I had stood first in the state at that time, and later pursued the painting artform. The techniques of textile making-like printing, collaging-are also like art works. Textile is not just a piece of cloth; it has history, tradition and art, with natural fibres like cotton, silk, wool, jute, among others. Textiles reflect who we are. More than the attire, it is a symbol of transition (from past to present, to future),"" said Miller.On the future of textiles, she elaborated that even the oldest looms of Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, are adapting certain AI features now to improve their efficiency. ""AI revolutionizes logistics, which is why the traditional textiles are also using AI, which also helps you to become more creative and artistic,"" said Miller.She said there is a possibility of using LED lights in created fabrics, with the help of AI. Or fabrics that change colours depending on the wearer's body temperature. ""So, integrating textile design with fashion studies is essential.""However, some negative effects, she added, is AI's ""over reliance"" on trends. ""AI can also create issues in security and intellectual property rights. Hence, there can be data breach, affecting someone who is creatively producing their own textile brand.""Kushal Jangid, director of NIFT, said: ""We would like to extend our appreciation to TOI for conducting the session on the art and science of textiles through Ms Miller.

Understanding Fujiwhara Effect: The rare storm interactions and their impact



Why the Fujiwhara Effect is rare in the Atlantic



Humberto and 94L storms showing unpredictable movement from Fujiwhara Effect



How the Fujiwhara Effect alters storm dynamics



The stronger storm dominates, absorbing the weaker storm’s circulation.

The weaker storm orbits the stronger one, potentially altering its path or intensity.

Historical examples of the Fujiwhara Effect



In 1974, Hurricanes Ione and Kirsten in the eastern Pacific orbited each other, exemplifying the classic Fujiwhara “dance.”

In the Atlantic, Philippe and Rina (2023) briefly engaged in orbital motion before one storm absorbed the other.

Forecast outlook and potential impacts



Implications for residents and communities



Coastal residents should remain vigilant for sudden changes in storm forecasts.

Emergency agencies must consider multiple scenarios for landfall, flooding, and wind impacts.

Awareness and preparedness plans are essential given the unpredictable nature of interacting storms.

The Atlantic Ocean may witness one of meteorology’s rarest and most intriguing phenomena this week as Tropical Storm Humberto and a nearby developing system, Invest 94L, move closer together. These storms could interact through the Fujiwhara Effect, a complex dynamic where two cyclonic systems orbit around a shared center. While more common in the western Pacific, this effect occasionally occurs in the Atlantic, last seen in 2023 with Tropical Storms Philippe and Rina. Such interactions can dramatically affect storm trajectories, intensities, wind speeds, and landfall possibilities, significantly complicating forecasts. The Fujiwhara Effect can result in one storm dominating, merging with the other, or creating unpredictable rotations, making it a key focus for meteorologists and vulnerable coastal communities.The Fujiwhara Effect is a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when two cyclones or hurricanes spinning in the same direction come within roughly 900 miles of each other. Upon reaching this proximity, the storms begin to orbit a shared central point, creating a “dancing” motion.This movement is not a simple rotation; each storm circulates around the midpoint, much like two ice skaters holding hands and spinning in a synchronized pattern.Typically, the stronger storm dominates, pulling the weaker system into its circulation, potentially absorbing it entirely. In rarer cases, storms of nearly equal strength can merge, forming a single, more powerful cyclone. This effect was first observed and documented in the 1920s by Dr. Sakuhei Fujiwhara, a Japanese meteorologist who studied interactions of vortices in water and their implications for larger atmospheric systems.The Fujiwhara Effect is more commonly observed in the western Pacific due to the higher frequency of cyclones forming in close proximity. In the Atlantic, simultaneous storms close enough to interact are less frequent, which is why such occurrences are notable. The last recorded Atlantic Fujiwhara event took place in September 2023, when Tropical Storms Philippe and Rina briefly engaged in a complex orbital pattern before one storm overtook the other.The rarity of this effect in the Atlantic adds a layer of unpredictability to hurricane season forecasting. When two storms interact, standard models may struggle to accurately predict track, intensity, and potential landfall, making early warnings and continuous monitoring essential.Currently, Tropical Storm Humberto (formerly known as Invest 93L) is moving west-northwest across the Atlantic with sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasts suggest Humberto could strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend. Meanwhile, Invest 94L, which is likely to become Tropical Storm Imelda, is developing nearby.Meteorologists are particularly focused on these two systems because the potential Fujiwhara interaction could dramatically alter 94L’s path. While Humberto is expected to remain mostly offshore, its gravitational influence on 94L could either push it toward land or deflect it, significantly affecting risk zones along the US East Coast. This interdependence highlights how unpredictable tropical storm behavior can become when multiple systems are involved.When storms enter a Fujiwhara interaction, they rotate around a shared center rather than simply around each other. The outcomes of this interaction can vary:In rare cases, two similar-strength storms merge, creating a single, more powerful cyclone.These dynamics complicate forecasting models, as standard prediction tools struggle to account for the rotational and merging behaviors of interacting systems. Satellite imagery, historical storm analysis, and advanced computer modeling are crucial to track these interactions and anticipate possible landfall scenarios.Several notable cases demonstrate the effects of storm interaction:These examples underscore the unpredictable nature of the Fujiwhara Effect and its ability to significantly influence storm behavior, including paths, intensities, and potential impacts on coastal regions.Meteorologists note that both Humberto (Invest 93L) and Invest 94L (Imelda) have a high likelihood of developing further in the coming days. While Humberto may largely remain at sea, 94L could bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and potential flooding to the Southeast or Mid-Atlantic US coasts.Even if 94L stays offshore, atmospheric conditions may channel moisture inland, creating flash flood risks in areas such as the Carolinas, southern Appalachians, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic starting this weekend. Due to the potential Fujiwhara interaction, tracking these systems closely is critical. Small shifts in position or intensity could dramatically change which regions are affected, highlighting the need for constant monitoring from the National Hurricane Center and local authorities.The Fujiwhara Effect is not just a meteorological curiosity; it has real-world implications for safety and preparedness:The potential interaction between Humberto and Invest 94L serves as a reminder of how complex and dynamic tropical storm behavior can be, particularly when multiple systems form close to each other.","The Fujiwhara Effect is a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when two cyclones or hurricanes spinning in the same direction come within roughly 900 miles of each other.

This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

“And stay tuned: Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot.”

How Microsoft and OpenAI are reducing dependency on each other



Google hits $3 trillion: How Alphabet became the fastest to reach the milestone





Microsoft has begun diversifying its AI technology by integrating a model from Anthropic into its 365 Copilot assistant. The Amazon and Google-backed AI startup is a key rival to Microsoft’s principal partner, OpenAI . The software giant recently announced that it will start using the Anthropic model to answer some queries for its commercial clients. This move signals a shift in Microsoft's generative AI strategy, which has historically relied almost exclusively on OpenAI models for features across products like Bing and Windows. Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having committed more than $13 billion as part of its strategic partnership.Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.Employees in organisations that are part of Microsoft’s Frontier program, which gives early access to AI tools, can now opt to use Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 reasoning model.This model is built to handle complex tasks and serves as an alternative to OpenAI’s offering within Researcher.In a blog post, Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s president of business and industry Copilot, wrote:Corporate customers can now choose Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 when creating custom AI agents using Microsoft’s Copilot Studio.However, administrators will need to enable Anthropic models before employees can access them. These models operate on Amazon and Google cloud platforms and are governed by Anthropic’s terms and conditions, Lamanna noted.Alongside adding models from outside partners, Microsoft has also begun testing MAI-1-preview, its own in-house large language model.OpenAI has been actively building partnerships with major players. In recent weeks, it announced plans to spend $300 billion with Oracle and signed a $10 billion deal with chip designer Broadcom. This week, Nvidia revealed it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a joint push to develop massive new data centres.While Microsoft and OpenAI continue to work closely, their relationship is shifting. Last year, Microsoft announced that GitHub Copilot Chat would also utilise models from Anthropic and Google, in addition to those from OpenAI.Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, Anthropic was recently valued at $183 billion. Still, Microsoft remains the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI’s programming interface that third-party apps depend on.","Anthropic’s model is set to debut in Researcher, a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent that helps collect information, analyse it, and create reports.

How LinkedIn is planning to train AI models with user data



“On November 3, 2025, we’ll start to use some data from members in these regions to train content-generating AI models that enhance your experience and better connect our members to opportunities.

This may include data like details from your profile, and public content you post on LinkedIn; it does not include your private messages. We rely on legitimate interest to process your data for this purpose. You can opt out anytime in your settings if you’d prefer not to have your data used in this way.

”

“In our updated User Agreement, we’ve made some changes to make it more readable, and to make some defined terms such as ‘Affiliate’ more prominent. We also added details about when we won’t be able to provide you the typical prior notice about changes to these terms (i.e., because laws change or a new product is launched). We’ve also added more information about when we will use secondary payment methods you may have provided to us, clarified that deep fakes and other wrongful impersonations violate our Terms, and provided more information about how you can appeal LinkedIn decisions that impact your use of our Services,”
