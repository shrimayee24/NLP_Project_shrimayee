The Ultimate Flagship for No Man’s Sky Voyager

Theis the ultimate modular ship for pilots who want unmatched power, customization, and style. These massive, walkable vessels serve as both a mobile base and a flagship for multiplayer crews. Securing one, along with rare S-class modules, requires exploration, scavenging, and smart trading.The S-class Corvette Ship in No Man’s Sky Voyager represents the top tier of the new modular ship system introduced in the Voyager update. Unlike standard ships, Corvettes can be walked through, customized, and expanded with crew modules, reactors, and interior builds. With maximum base stats for hull strength, speed, and equipment slots, an S-class Corvette offers the highest possible performance and long-term potential.Players begin their Corvette adventure in the Corvette Workshop on a Space Station, which is reachable via the four teleport bays with blue doors. Building a beginning Corvette requires at least 10 million units and 16 inventory slots. Important beginning modules include:• Cockpit• Reactor• Habitation Module• Thrusters• Landing GearThe Workshop permits changes, such as changing modules and increasing core stats, after it has been constructed.Pilots must only install S-class engines, reactors, and shield generators - all of which are obtained independently through exploration, trading, or salvage—in order to achieve S-class status.One of the most reliable ways to farm Corvette parts is by scanning planets for the “Salvageable Scrap” tag. Land on these planets and track down buried module containers, marked by yellow Wi-Fi-like icons. Using a Terrain Manipulator to dig them up yields valuable modules, including rare and S-class parts. Acquiring these parts will bring you a step close to getting an S-class Corvette Ship in No Man's Sky Voyager.Derelict Freighters provide another rich source of advanced Corvette modules. These haunted wrecks, accessed via special coordinates or NPC missions, contain lootable storage crates and technology rooms where S-class upgrades are often hidden. They are particularly effective for farming rare reactors and shield modules.The Corvette Workshop not only enables construction but also offers a Trade Advanced Modules feature. By exchanging lower-tier finds, players can roll for higher-quality parts. Persistence and stacking high-value trades increase the odds of receiving S-class modules, though rare upgrades may still take multiple attempts to obtain.Beyond scrap and freighter runs, several other reliable methods exist:• Combat Rewards: Defeating space pirates or raiding freighter cargo pods has a chance to drop modules.• Expeditions and Events: Voyager’s limited-time missions often grant exclusive S-class upgrades and cosmetics.• Community Drops: Twitch Drops and official event rewards can unlock rare customization kits and ship parts.• Balance Your Build: Heavier armor increases durability but reduces speed; lighter builds favor mobility.• Interior Upgrades: Place Refiners, Research Units, or storage in your Corvette to turn it into a mobile base.• Spacewalk Exploration: Pilots can leave their seats, walk inside their ship mid-flight, or step outside for cosmic views.Also read: No Man’s Sky Voyagers Update 6.0 Patch Notes: New Corvette-Class Starships and Major Upgrades For dedicated explorers, an S-class Corvette Ship in No Man’s Sky Voyager is more than just a ship - it’s a floating fortress, a crew hub, and a statement of mastery in No Man’s Sky Voyager.

Dwayne Johnson ’s slimmer appearance raises questions of sudden muscle loss

Antonio Brown ’s blunt comment stirs controversy

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has built his career on a larger-than-life image, both on screen and in the gym. Known for his powerhouse physique and relentless workout discipline, Johnson has long been admired as Hollywood’s strongest man. But a recent video showing him looking significantly leaner has set off a wave of speculation online—and Antonio Brown has now added fuel to the fire with a sharp, unfiltered jab.The conversation began after commentator Dom Lucre shared a short clip of Johnson in a casual floral shirt, standing beside a co-star. The post quickly went viral with the caption: “DEVELOPING: Hollywood actor Dwayne The Rock Johnson has his fans concerned after he appeared looking like a different man in this video where he has loss almost all of his muscles. He was recently viewed as the biggest man Hollywood by most moviegoers. ”For fans used to seeing Johnson’s massive frame dominating red carpets and action films, the slimmer look was unexpected. While some speculated that it could be tied to a new film role, others raised concerns about his health.Antonio Brown, never one to hold back online, quote-tweeted the video with a blunt message of his own: “Steroids work until you stop using dem.”The remark instantly drew backlash, with many accusing Brown of unfairly targeting Johnson and spreading baseless claims. Others, however, argued that the comment reflected long-standing whispers about how celebrities maintain extreme physiques.Also Read: “Cam Newton’s p*ssy wet”: Antonio Brown sparks outrage with crude Beyoncé and Cam Newton remark Whether Johnson’s appearance is a temporary change, part of a new role, or simply a shift in his training routine, the reaction highlights the intense scrutiny that comes with being a global superstar.

Understanding NIL rules and their impact on student-athletes

When Basketball Dreams Meet Real Life Fatherhood Decisions

Millions of dollars have traditionally been made from TV deals and ads related to college athletics. However, typically, student athletes don't earn much money. Nevertheless, the NIL allows student players to profit from their name, reportedly has fundamentally altered collegiate athletics, as per NBA veteran Dwyane Wade . He recently took to the podcast Time Out and opened up about the same. He further talked about his son going to college and joining their basketball team.Dwyane Wade is one of the all-time greats in NBA history. However, before everything, he played for Marquette University prior to the 2001-02 NCAA season. Now, he could see the change in college basketball. He recently opened up about the modern rules and regulations on Time Out. He said:“We’re in this era now where college sports are about the portal… It’s about NIL.”He continued:“It's about the collective. It's about all these different things that we didn't experience. Obviously, I didn't even have to experience it. He didn't go to college, but I didn't. So, as a father, you have to put your sons in positions at this point..”He then added:“As you're watching Devin's, you know, progression, you got a decision to make. Do I send him to college? Do I hold him and let him go to prep school so he can keep developing? Like, these different decisions you guys have to make…”He further said:“As soon as you lose a game or two, they go back to these coaches. These coaches have had this system since they first started coaching. They stick with your system, boy…”An interim policy on name, image, and likeness, or NIL, was put into place by the NCAA in June 2021, enabling student-athletes to profit from their personal brands.States have different NIL laws, therefore it might be a little confusing.The regulations established by the high school sports association in a state will determine whether or not high school students are permitted to engage in NIL activities. Universities and colleges also frequently have their own special NIL regulations.The acronym ""NIL"" represents ""name, image, and likeness."" It refers to a person's legal right to manage the use of their image, including in a commercial setting. By joining collegiate sports teams, student-athletes gave up their NIL rights because it has long been illegal for them to make deals to benefit on their popularity.College athletes have been negotiating sponsorship deals ever since their NIL rights were reinstated three years ago due to a mix of state legislation and NCAA regulation changes. What bargains athletes can make is determined by a combination of state laws and school policy. The NCAA requires colleges to create their own rules for their own athletes in states with little monitoring. Understanding these rules are extremely vital for the college athletes.Also read: ""We knew it in that moment""- Dwyane Wade reflects on 2003 draft class and how he, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh shifted NBA power",NBA veteran Dwyane Wade discusses the impact of NIL rules on college athletics.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shares 5 ChatGPT prompts he swears by for daily work that show what’s now possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-shares-5-chatgpt-prompts-he-swears-by-for-daily-work-that-show-whats-now-possible/articleshow/123559941.cms,"Satya Nadella’s 5 ChatGPT prompts for daily workflow

1. Predict key discussion points for meetings



2. Draft comprehensive project updates



3. Assess product launch readiness



4. Categorize time and focus areas



5. Prepare for specific meetings

AI-driven productivity at work emphasised by Satya Nadella



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot , has become an essential part of his daily workflow. Launched on August 7, 2025, GPT-5 brings advanced AI capabilities across apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, and Excel, analyzing data from emails, meetings, and chats to provide actionable insights. Nadella shared five specific prompts that he uses to streamline work, save time, and improve decision-making. These examples showcase how AI can anticipate meeting priorities, prepare project updates, track progress, and optimize scheduling, reflecting a shift toward AI-driven productivity at the executive level.“Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting.”Nadella uses GPT-5 to analyze past interactions with colleagues and generate a list of five topics likely to be on their minds in upcoming meetings. By scanning emails, chat histories, and previous meetings, the AI anticipates priorities, unresolved issues, and recurring themes, helping executives prepare efficiently and align discussions with strategic goals.“Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers.”Another prompt allows GPT-5 to compile project updates by aggregating data from emails, chats, and meetings. The AI highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) versus targets, successes and setbacks, potential risks, and competitive actions. It even predicts likely questions from stakeholders and suggests thoughtful responses, ensuring concise, data-driven communication for briefings and reports. By leveraging GPT-5 for project updates, Nadella ensures faster, more accurate reporting while freeing time for higher-level strategic thinking.“Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check engineering progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability.”Nadella asks GPT-5 to evaluate whether projects, like an upcoming product launch, are on track. The AI reviews engineering progress, pilot program results, and potential risks, then calculates a probability of success. This probabilistic insight supports informed decision-making and helps executives identify areas needing attention before critical deadlines. These prompts illustrate how AI is moving from a supportive tool to a central decision-making partner in modern leadership.“Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions.”GPT-5 can analyze Nadella’s calendar and email activity over the past month to categorize his time into 5–7 project “buckets.” It estimates the percentage of time spent on each and provides short descriptions, offering a clear overview of focus areas. This allows leaders to optimize schedules, reallocate efforts, and ensure alignment with strategic priorities. By identifying time sinks, GPT-5 ensures leaders avoid burnout and maximize efficiency. It also helps executives quickly see if their time matches organizational goals.“Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions.”The final prompt reviews a selected email and prepares Nadella for an upcoming meeting by summarizing relevant past discussions with managers and team members. The AI suggests talking points, action items, and context-aware insights, helping executives enter meetings fully informed and ready to address key decisions efficiently. This proactive support reduces time spent digging through notes or inboxes. It ensures that meetings are focused, productive, and strategically aligned.Nadella’s use of GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot reflects a broader trend toward AI-powered workflows. By automating routine tasks, analyzing complex data, and generating actionable insights, AI can save time, improve strategic decision-making, and enhance overall productivity. Many companies are now exploring similar AI-driven integrations to streamline workflows and boost productivity across multiple levels of their organizations. As organizations continue to integrate tools like GPT-5, executives and teams alike can leverage AI to focus on higher-value work while staying informed, organized, and proactive. This approach also fosters a culture of data-driven decision-making, empowering employees to take informed actions quickly. Additionally, it helps bridge communication gaps between departments by providing shared insights and context in real time.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, has become an essential part of his daily workflow.

Meta AI head Alexandr Wang's memo to employees on massive AI restructure makes one thing clear: Everyone will ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-head-alexandr-wangs-memo-to-employees-on-massive-ai-restructure-makes-one-thing-clear-everyone-will-report-to-wang/articleshow/123598963.cms,"From Scale AI to Meta’s AI architect

Read Alexandr Wang's full memo here

Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra. We are building a world-class organization around these areas, and have brought in some incredible leaders to drive the work forward.

As we previously announced, Shengjia Zhao will direct our research efforts as Chief Scientist for MSL, Nat Friedman will lead our product effort and Rob Fergus will continue to lead FAIR. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Aparna Ramani will be moving over to MSL to lead the infrastructure necessary to support our ambitious research and product bets.

As part of this, we are dissolving the AGI Foundations organization and moving the talent from that team into the right areas. Teams whose work naturally aligns with and serves our products will move to Nat's team. Some of the researchers will move to FAIR to double down on our long term research while teams working on infra will transition into Aparna's org. Anyone who is changing teams will get an update from their manager or HRBP today, if you haven't already.

We're making three key changes to our organizational design that will help us to accelerate our efforts.

Centralizing core, fundamental research efforts in TBD Lab and FAIR. Bolstering our product efforts with applied research that will work on product-focused models. Establishing a unified, core infrastructure team to support our research bets.

The work will map to four teams:

TBD Lab will be a small team focused on training and scaling large models to achieve superintelligence across pre-training, reasoning, and post-training, and explore new directions such as an omni model.

FAIR will be an innovation engine for MSL and we will aim to integrate and scale many of the research ideas and projects from FAIR into the larger model runs conducted by TBD Lab. Rob will continue to lead FAIR and Yann will continue to serve as Chief Scientist for FAIR, with both reporting to me.

Products & Applied Research will bring our product-focused research efforts closer to product development. This will include teams previously working on Assistant, Voice, Media, Trust, Embodiment and Developer pillars in AI Tech. Nat will continue to lead this work reporting to me.

MSL Infra team will unify elements of Infra and MSL's infrastructure teams into one. This team will focus on accelerating AI research and production by building advanced infrastructure, optimized GPU clusters, comprehensive environments, data infrastructure, and developer tools to support state-of-the-art research, products and AI development across Meta. Aparna will lead this team reporting to me.

Ahmad and Amir will continue reporting to me focusing on strategic MSL initiatives they will share more about later.

I recognize that org changes can be disruptive, but I truly believe that taking the time to get this structure right now will allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term. We're still working through updated rhythms and our collaboration model across teams, including when we'll come together as a full MSL org.

Thank you all for your flexibility as we adapt to this new structure. Every team in MSL plays a critical role and I'm excited to get to work with all of you.

In a new and dramatic move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making the most aggressive move in his AI arm race. Zuckerberg is now reorganising the company’s artificial intelligence operations by restricting the Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) into four distinct teams. As reported by Business Insider the company outlined the move in an internal memo from the newly appointed chief of AI Alexandr Wang. The internal email, sent by Alexandr Wang , the 28-year-old head of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), outlines a dramatic restructuring aimed at accelerating Meta’s pursuit of “personal superintelligence”—AI that can outperform humans across intellectual domains.According to a report by Business Insider, the reorganization splits the company’s AI efforts into four specialized teams—TBD Lab, FAIR, Products & Applied Research, and MSL Infra. However, another important update shared in the memo revealed that nearly all the senior leaders in Meta’s AI ecosystem will now directly report to Wang. This list also includes high-profile hires like former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who will lead product integration, and engineering veteran Aparna Ramani, who will oversee infrastructure.Alexandr Wang, founder of the AI startup ScaleAI shared a bold mandate in order to accelerate Meta’s race toward superintelligence. His memo dissolves the AGI Foundations group and redistributes its talent across the new structure, emphasizing speed, clarity, and centralized execution. “Superintelligence is coming,” Wang wrote. “And in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product, and infra”.The memo marks a clear consolidation of power and vision under Wang, reflecting Meta’s urgency to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google.","Alexandr Wang, Meta's new chief of AI, outlines a dramatic restructuring aimed at accelerating Meta’s pursuit of “personal superintelligence’ Wang: “We are building a world-class organization around these areas, and have brought in some incredible leaders to drive the work forward”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123598960,imgsize-25074,width-400,resizemode-4/meta-is-freezing-hiring-for-its-ai-unit-and-prohibiting-internal-transfers-as-well.jpg"

Why this feature matters for Instagram



Meta-owned Instagram is reportedly working on a new Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature for Reels. The upcoming feature will enable users to watch short videos in a floating window while navigating other apps in their screen. The test confirmed by Meta , is presently available to a select group of users and marks a significant step towards improving multitasking on mobile devices . The test was first spotted by app researcher Radu Oncescu, who shared screenshots of the feature on Threads.The users selected for the testing phase will now notice a pop-up prompt inviting them to “Try Picture in Picture.” Once the feature is enabled, Reels can play in a small window which will remain active even after exiting the Instagram app. Users will also be allowed to toggle on or off the feature via the app settings menu.Instagram took a lot of time in introducing this feature as its rival platforms such as TikTok and YouTube already offer the same PiP functionality to its users. With the ability to run Reels in the background, Instagram aims to boost both engagement and retention. The feature may also help the platform in keeping the users engaged while watching long videos which otherwise users skip.With attention spans shrinking and multitasking becoming the norm, PiP could help creators reach wider audiences by keeping their content visible even as users switch tasks. For Meta, it’s a strategic play to increase time spent on Instagram and compete more aggressively in the short-form video space.Instagram head Adam Mosseri hinted at the feature months ago, responding to user requests by saying he’d “talk to the team and see if we can figure something out”. Now, that promise is taking shape.",Instagram is reportedly working on a new Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature for Reels.

US President Donald Trump addressed a viral video during his Oval Office announcement on Wednesday, in which an object appears to be dumped from a White House window—a clip that has sparked intense speculation online.Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy showed Trump the footage, which has gone viral on X, with millions of viewers asking the same question: What was in the bag?“No, that's probably AI-generated. You can't open the windows. They're all heavily-armored. I know every window up there. The last place I'd be doing it is there,” Trump said. He added, “They're sealed, and each window weighs about 600 pounds.”The video shows the object sailing through the air before hitting the ground. While the act appears to violate standard White House security protocols, neither the Secret Service nor the White House provided any explanation, deepening the mystery and fueling online speculation.Social media users quickly reacted with a mix of theories and humor. “It’s Melania.

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

Stone Age underwater city: A window into prehistoric life

Broader research and scientific significance





Archaeologists have uncovered a remarkably well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast. Dubbed the “Stone Age Atlantis,” the site went underwater as massive ice sheets melted at the end of the last Ice Age, raising sea levels and flooding coastal communities. Preserved in an oxygen-free underwater environment, the settlement has effectively become a “time capsule,” halting decomposition and providing unprecedented insight into early human life. Artefacts, including wooden tools, arrowheads, animal bones, hazelnuts, and seal teeth, reveal a thriving Mesolithic society skilled in fishing, hunting, and crafting tools.The settlement offers a rare glimpse into Mesolithic life. Archaeologists have excavated about 430 square feet at a depth of 26 feet, uncovering evidence of organised human activity. Wooden tools, stone implements, and food remnants, such as hazelnuts, indicate a society that relied on fishing, hunting, and gathering. The site’s preservation provides valuable information on how early humans adapted to environmental changes, particularly rising sea levels that transformed coastlines and habitats.Researchers employed specialised underwater technologies, including vacuum systems, to safely recover artefacts without damaging them. The oxygen-free conditions preserved both organic and inorganic materials, allowing archaeologists to study Mesolithic tools, structures, and dietary remains in remarkable detail. Experts describe the site as a “time capsule,” where everything feels as though time has stopped, offering unique insights into prehistoric human life.This discovery is part of a six-year, €15.5 million European Union-funded project mapping submerged prehistoric landscapes across the North and Baltic Seas. Scientists aim to reconstruct coastal human activity, subsistence strategies, and adaptation to climate change during the post-Ice Age period. The Aarhus site complements other submerged settlements, including locations near Alexandria, Egypt, and lakes in North America, shedding light on how ancient civilisations responded to rising waters and changing environments. The artefacts offer a fascinating glimpse into everyday life in the Stone Age. They also highlight the skill and ingenuity of early humans in using available resources.Stone Age Atlantis demonstrates how early humans thrived despite environmental challenges. Artefacts such as fishing tools, seal remains, and arrowheads highlight their ingenuity, while the preserved settlement layout suggests organised community life. Beyond archaeology, the site offers valuable lessons for modern societies on climate resilience, illustrating how humans have historically adapted to rising sea levels—insights that remain highly relevant today. The Stone Age Atlantis discovery not only enriches our understanding of prehistoric human ingenuity but also underscores the enduring importance of studying ancient responses to environmental change.","Archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast.

Tiny robot captures secrets of the Great Pyramid: Exploring Queen's hidden Chamber for the first time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tiny-robot-captures-secrets-of-the-great-pyramid-exploring-queens-hidden-chamber-for-the-first-time/articleshow/123578165.cms,"

A remarkable journey inside the Great Pyramid



Hidden symbols and their potential meaning

Preserving history through technology





For more than 4,500 years, Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has intrigued explorers, historians, and archaeologists, holding mysteries that have long eluded discovery. Now, a tiny, purpose-built robot weighing just 5 kg has offered an unprecedented glimpse into one of the pyramid’s most inaccessible areas: a narrow shaft leading out of the Queen’s Chamber. Designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure, the robot captured footage that revealed previously unseen chambers and intricate painted symbols on the stone floor, challenging traditional assumptions about the pyramid’s construction and purpose.The robot’s journey is part of the Djedi Project, led by engineers from the University of Leeds in collaboration with inventor Dr. Tze Chuen Ng. Their goal was to explore the mysterious shafts without harming the centuries-old stones, combining ingenuity, robotics, and patience over several years. This small device’s careful ascent has opened a window into the secrets of a monument that has fascinated the world for millennia.The Queen’s Chamber shaft, which rises at a 40-degree angle, had long resisted exploration due to its narrow dimensions.Previous attempts to probe it caused damage, making a safe, non-invasive approach essential. After nearly five years of development, the tiny 5 kg robot was able to navigate the 60-meter shaft gently, bypassing one blocking stone with a flexible camera arm.Beyond it, the robot discovered a small sealed chamber featuring colored symbols painted directly on the stone floor, hinting at symbolic or ritualistic significance. A second stone further along the shaft blocked the robot, leaving what lies beyond still unknown. The discovery adds yet another layer to the ongoing mystery of the Great Pyramid, showing that even the smallest spaces may hide details of great cultural value.It also reinforces the idea that every exploration inside this monument brings the world a step closer to understanding how and why it was built. The painted symbols may also offer clues about the daily lives or beliefs of workers who built the pyramid.The discovery of painted markings challenges the idea that the shafts served solely as air vents. Experts suggest the artwork may indicate ceremonial or symbolic purposes, possibly tied to ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife and the pharaoh’s soul. The deliberate placement of multiple stones also suggests intentional concealment, reinforcing the theory that these spaces had more than just architectural function. The project highlights the growing role of interdisciplinary collaboration, showing how engineers, archaeologists, and historians can work together to solve ancient mysteries. It emphasizes that even the most delicate explorations can yield invaluable insights when guided by innovation and care.Though further exploration is on hold due to security concerns in Egypt, the robot’s footage provides a rare and invaluable view into these long-hidden chambers. The discoveries have reignited worldwide fascination with ancient Egypt, inspiring both researchers and enthusiasts to look closer at the pyramids’ hidden secrets. Experts believe that continued technological innovation may uncover even more chambers, reshaping our understanding of Egyptian history.Such findings remind us that the Great Pyramid is not just an architectural wonder but also a cultural and spiritual symbol. Each new clue adds to its enduring story, proving that its mysteries are far from exhausted even after thousands of years. The painted symbols may also offer clues about the daily lives or beliefs of workers who built the pyramid. If future explorations succeed, these chambers could reveal details about rituals, astronomy, or record-keeping practices of ancient Egypt.While the full mysteries of the Great Pyramid remain elusive, the tiny robot’s expedition demonstrates the potential of modern technology to illuminate ancient secrets. By combining robotics, careful engineering, and digital documentation, researchers have not only avoided damaging the pyramid but also sparked renewed global interest in Egyptology.The released footage allows historians, archaeologists, and the public to engage with these discoveries directly, offering insights into a monument that continues to inspire awe more than four millennia after its construction. The Djedi Project team hopes to resume exploration once conditions in Egypt allow, potentially unlocking more hidden chambers. This breakthrough shows how the smallest tools can sometimes unlock the biggest mysteries of human history.These findings could mark just the beginning of a new era in non-invasive archaeology.

Looking Ahead

Partial Lunar Eclipse — July 6, 2028

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE — December 31, 2028

This will align with New Year’s Eve, offering a second dramatic Blood Moon in just over three years.





On the night of September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory — an 82-minute stretch of totality that will turn the Moon a vivid red. The event will be visible from all seven emirates, with global livestreams and local public viewings set to make the spectacle accessible to millions.A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow — the umbra — across the Moon’s surface. During this alignment, sunlight bends through the Earth’s atmosphere, scattering blue light and allowing red tones to reach and reflect off the Moon, creating the phenomenon popularly known as a Blood Moon.This particular eclipse stands out for two reasons:The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG) emphasizes that this combination of extended totality and widespread visibility makes the September 7 eclipse especially significant.The celestial spectacle will unfold over almost five and a half hours, beginning with the faint penumbral eclipse, progressing through the partial phases, and culminating in the most visually dramatic stage, totality, when the Moon will be completely immersed in Earth’s umbra and appear red in color.This breathtaking phase will be fully visible across all seven emirates, starting in the late evening and continuing past 10:30 PM.During this 82-minute window, the Moon will take on varying shades of red depending on atmospheric conditions, dust levels, and light pollution.The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), founded in 2000, has played a central role in popularising astronomy and space science across the Middle East. Over the past two decades, it has established itself as the region’s leading authority in the field, offering expert consultancy to government bodies and major private-sector institutions.DAG actively promotes public engagement with astronomy through a range of initiatives, including outdoor astronomical observations, public lectures, exhibitions, and conferences. The group also maintains an in-house resource centre and leverages social media to reach a wider audience. Dedicated observing sites further support its mission of making the night sky accessible to all.In line with this mission, DAG will host a public viewing event in Dubai, offering telescopes, expert guidance, and group observation sessions. Event details, including the venue and registration process, will be announced soon.A special highlight of the event will be a curated photo moment capturing the Blood Moon as it rises behind the Burj Khalifa, in collaboration with acclaimed photographer Rami Dibo.To include international audiences, DAG will host a global livestream, featuring:This coordinated broadcast aims to connect skywatchers around the world in a shared experience of the eclipse.Lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no glasses or filters are needed.

Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas. This new mandate comes as part of a government crackdown on unlicensed co-living arrangements, aiming to ensure that only authorized residents occupy rented properties. The change requires tenants to provide full details of everyone living in their unit, regardless of whether they are the primary tenant or a co-occupant. With this step, Dubai’s authorities are tightening enforcement of tenancy laws, ensuring that only those officially listed are permitted to reside in a property.As of recent, landlords in Dubai have started scrutinizing the details included in Ejari contracts to ensure that the names of all individuals residing in a property are listed. The rules are simple: any person staying in the unit for a month or longer must be entered into the system using the Dubai REST app. Failure to do so can lead to complications, with landlords pressing tenants to provide the missing information.The initiative comes as the Dubai Land Department (DLD) intensifies efforts to eliminate unlicensed co-living arrangements. Landlords who continue to violate these regulations face stringent penalties, as the authorities adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards unauthorized shared living.The process of registering co-living individuals on the Ejari system is straightforward, especially with the help of the Dubai REST app, The Ejari contracts are registered with the Dubai Land Department in the name of either the principal tenant or the landlord.Tenants must follow these steps to update their records:The updated rules apply to family members, domestic help, and any other co-occupants who reside in the unit. This is crucial for tenants who wish to avoid issues when dealing with government agencies, utilities, and landlords.Ejari, which means ""My Rent"" in Arabic, is a mandatory rental registration system introduced by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) under the Dubai Land Department (DLD) in 2007. It serves as the backbone of Dubai’s rental market, ensuring that all agreements are legally documented. Here's why Ejari matters:By ensuring that all co-residents are accurately recorded, Ejari adds transparency to Dubai’s rental market and helps maintain accountability.With stricter enforcement of housing laws, the importance of complying with Ejari regulations cannot be overstated. Tenants benefit from Ejari by ensuring their rental agreements are properly documented, which is essential when setting up utilities, renewing visas, or even resolving disputes. For landlords, having a valid and properly registered Ejari contract provides legal protection and ensures they are not unintentionally breaking any laws.Furthermore, the recent crackdown on unlicensed shared living arrangements is a reminder for tenants to be diligent about their housing agreements. Landlords who permit unauthorized occupants without the proper registrations face heavy penalties, which may include fines or even loss of their ability to lease properties.As part of Dubai’s broader digital transformation efforts, a new update rolled out in June has made Ejari registration more accessible than ever. Through a joint initiative between the Dubai Land Department (DLD) and Injaz Real Estate Registration Trustee, tenants can now complete the process remotely via WhatsApp, using the AQARI platform.Originally launched in August 2024 to streamline services such as title deed data amendments and property valuations, AQARI has evolved into one of the UAE’s most comprehensive remote property service platforms with the addition of Ejari registration in June 2025.This new service simplifies the process significantly, eliminating the need for in-person visits. Tenants can start by visiting the AQARI platform and clicking the WhatsApp chat icon, which launches an automated chat to guide users through various services, including:With access to 10 DLD-approved Service Trustees through WhatsApp, users can complete these transactions from anywhere in the world. This advancement supports Dubai’s smart governance goals while enhancing convenience for both landlords and tenants.","Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people. (The Conversation) RD RD","The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms. People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123483213,imgsize-1212831,width-400,resizemode-4/123483213.jpg"
Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated.

Prince Andrew’s Lies EXPOSED? Leaked Emails Contradict His Epstein Timeline Claims | WATCH

Netizens can’t stop guessing

From Melania to the Lincoln bedroom bathroom

Mystery deepens





A strange scene unfolded at the White House on Labor Day, September 1, when a dark, unidentified bag was filmed being thrown from a second-floor window - right into a restricted area. The moment, caught on camera, has gone viral on X, with millions now asking the same question: What was in the bag?The clip shows the object sailing through the air before hitting the ground. The act is a clear violation of standard security protocol, but so far, neither the Secret Service nor the White House has offered any explanation, only deepening the mystery.Online sleuths wasted no time filling in the blanks. Some suggested it was all routine. “Contractors often throw construction debris out the window rather than carry it downstairs. It may be that a room is being remodeled and furnishings such as carpet, drapery, etc. are being tossed out to a dumpster,” one user wrote.Others leaned into past government lore. “All I know is when I worked in Aerospace on Gov. contracts, and new equipment was needed but not in the budget, equipment like say, typewriters, often fell out of a window.Not saying I did it, just saying it happened,” another claimed.But then came the darker, wilder takes. “Boy those Epstein files took up a lot of bags when they were shredded…” one person wrote. Another joked, “Probably just the very best handling of classified documents.”Some comments were straight out of a political thriller. “It’s Melania. She is sneaking out before the Epstein files are exposed because her phone # is in them as well!” one user said. Another claimed, “That’s the bathroom connected to the Lincoln bedroom. They’re gutting it because Trump doesn’t like art deco. Ironically, the demo starts on Labor Day.”And the theories didn’t stop there. “Construction workers are throwing trash out of the window, these are the very same people Trump wants to report are doing the rehab work for him,” one user added, pointing to ongoing renovations. Another wrote: “There’s renovation in the White House… Prs. Trump has told about it before…”With no official word from Washington, the mystery bag has now become internet legend, giving rise to everything from jokes about shredded files to speculation about White House renovations.For now, all anyone knows is this: a bag was tossed out of the most secure building in America on a national holiday — and the internet may never let it go.","A dark, unidentified bag was filmed being thrown from a second-floor window - right into a restricted area.

An Indian-American man has gone viral for an unexpected confession: he says his white American wife is the reason he feels more Indian than ever.The video, shared on the couple’s joint account Half Past Chai, features Suketu Patel reflecting on his journey of self-acceptance alongside his wife, Hallie. What struck viewers most was Patel’s honesty about trying to “fit in” while growing up in the US.“I think a lot of Indian Americans, they go through this identity crisis when they’re in America. Everyone around them is white. So you try and be that,” Patel admitted in the clip, which has now been watched nearly 58,000 times. “I tried to be white all throughout my high school years. But then, I ran into this girl… Hallie was the first person to ask about my culture and be like, ‘What does this mean? Why do you do this?’”Patel said Hallie’s curiosity and encouragement made him re-examine his relationship with his roots. “It made me start to think—I love who I am, I love my culture. I think I lost a lot of that because I tried to be someone I wasn’t. I truly think I’m more Indian because of Hallie. She just helped me be more myself.”The video text playfully read: “My wife made me more Indian”, and the internet was here for it.Reactions poured in from viewers who were touched by the couple’s story. “So amazing! So realistic,” one user wrote. Another chimed in, “This is so wholesome! I hope I make my husband this comfortable to be himself.”Others showered praise on Hallie, with one person noting,“Sometimes our own partners are the ones that make us believe in ourselves and appreciate where we come from.”With love, laughter, and chai at the center of their content, Suketu and Hallie’s story is a reminder that sometimes it takes someone else’s perspective to help us see the beauty in our own.","Indian-American Suketu Patel says his white American wife is the reason he feels more Indian than ever.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.
