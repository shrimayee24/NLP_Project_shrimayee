A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.",The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122605450,imgsize-1167559,width-400,resizemode-4/122605450.jpg"

A Call for Global Adoption







In a groundbreaking move that could reshape the way the world evaluates creative and scientific output, His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation, has announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind global classification system. The initiative, called the, aims to clearly differentiate between human and machine contributions in the research, production, and publication of creative, academic, scientific, and intellectual content.As reported by the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Sheikh Hamdan emphasized the urgency of this step in light of the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI):“Distinguishing between human creativity and artificial intelligence has become a real challenge in light of today’s rapid technological advances. This calls for a new approach to recognise the growing role of intelligent machines. That’s why we launched the world’s first Human–Machine Collaboration Icons, a classification system that brings transparency to how research documents, publications, and content are created. ”This new system is not just theoretical, it is being implemented immediately across Dubai’s government. Sheikh Hamdan has directed all Dubai Government entities to adopt the classification in their research and knowledge-based projects.The HMC classification system, developed by the Dubai Future Foundation, offers a practical and visually accessible way for readers, researchers, and decision-makers to understand the extent of AI involvement in content creation. The classification introduces five core icons that indicate the level of collaboration between humans and intelligent machines:This approach is designed to inject clarity into a domain where AI use often goes undisclosed. In today’s digital landscape, where tools like generative AI, automation systems, and intelligent algorithms increasingly shape content, it’s often difficult for consumers or collaborators to understand how much of the work was created by a human or a machine.The termin this context covers a broad range of technologies: from AI and automation tools to robotics and algorithms, or any digital system that plays a role in the research, design, writing, analysis, or presentation of information.The HMC system goes beyond top-level labels by introducing nine functional icons that show where, in the content creation process, human–machine collaboration took place. These icons are especially relevant to common research workflows and publication tasks, helping identify exactly how machines were involved.As a foundation, the classification system reflects key stages that typically involve machine assistance in research and content production. These include:For instance, a research paper may be marked “Machine Assisted” with functional icons indicating AI helped in data analysis and visuals, but ideation and writing were entirely human-led. This enables a more nuanced and transparent evaluation, providing valuable insight not only into thebut theof content creation.Importantly, the system does not attempt to assign numeric percentages or weights to the machine's contribution, acknowledging that these judgments can often be subjective. Instead, it empowers creators to be honest and transparent about the involvement of machines, providing audiences with the information they need to evaluate authenticity and integrity.Sheikh Hamdan's announcement is more than a local policy, it’s a global invitation.“We invite researchers, writers, publishers, designers, and content creators around the world to adopt this new global classification system and use it responsibly and in ways that benefit people,” he stated.This marks more than just a response to rapid technological change, it’s a clear signal that Dubai wants to shape how the world works with AI, not just adapt to it. As intelligent machines become more deeply involved in how we create and communicate, the line between human input and machine output continue to blur. The HMC Icons are meant to bring that line back into focus, not to hold innovation back, but to make sure people know what they’re looking at, and can trust what they’re reading or watching.By launching this system, Dubai is taking a leadership role in shaping ethical AI use and setting new standards for content transparency. The classification model is built to be adaptable across multiple sectors, such as academia, design, video production, and software development, where AI is increasingly integrated into everyday workflows. At its core, the system promotes honest disclosure of machine involvement, encouraging creators and institutions to uphold integrity by clearly showing how content is produced.By normalizing transparency, it may also reshape how AI involvement is perceived, less as a hidden shortcut and more as a declared, deliberate part of the creative and research process.","Dubai launched a global system to label human vs. AI roles in content creation.

Why Supercars? The Strategy Behind the Spectacle

Enforcement Efficiency: Dubai’s fast roads require police cars that can match or exceed the speed of offenders.





Public Engagement: Tourists frequently pose for photos with the cars, which strengthens the relationship between the force and the public.





Global Branding: The fleet projects Dubai’s image as a city of the future, rooted in innovation, luxury, and excellence.





Deterrence: The presence of high-performance vehicles serves as a visible deterrent to unlawful activity.





Sustainability: With growing EV integration, Dubai is aligning its law enforcement with green goals.





The Future of Policing?





In most parts of the world, police cars are designed for utility, not spectacle. In Dubai, however, they are a statement. Since 2013, the Dubai Police force has rewritten the playbook on law enforcement visibility by curating a vehicle fleet that looks more like an elite car show than a motor pool. With Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Rolls-Royces, and even a flying hoverbike, the Dubai Police fleet represents a unique blend of security, branding, and futuristic thinking.The transformation began in April 2013 with the induction of a Lamborghini Aventador into the police force. This was not simply about performance,it was about perception. The goal was clear: to elevate the image of Dubai as a global city of innovation, prosperity, and forward-thinking governance. Today, that vision is fully realized through a vehicle collection that symbolizes prestige, discipline, and a new form of civic engagement.Dubai’s roads are filled with high-performance vehicles owned by residents and tourists alike. To maintain authority and presence in such an environment, law enforcement vehicles had to match the city’s personality. These cars are strategically deployed in high-profile locations such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah Beach Residence, Dubai Mall, the Palm Jumeirah, and international expos,where they serve more as ambassadors than enforcers.While many of them are not used for daily patrols or high-speed pursuits, their presence deters crime and promotes a visible connection between police and the public.The Dubai Police force boasts a fleet of numerous supercars, but the exact number remains undisclosed. The collection is constantly evolving, and while not every vehicle is publicly confirmed, the lineup includes an unmatched variety of exotic, electric, luxury, and tactical models.The most expensive and fastest car in the Dubai Police fleet, the Bugatti Veyron is powered by an 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine that produces 1,001 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.5 seconds and reaches speeds beyond 400 km/h. Estimated at $1.6 million, it is a symbol of unmatched engineering and status.The flagship that started it all, the Aventador features a 6.5-litre V12 engine delivering 691 horsepower. With a top speed of 349 km/h and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 2.9 seconds, it turned the Dubai Police into a viral phenomenon practically overnight.Unveiled at the Arabian Travel Market in 2025, this luxury SUV comes equipped with a 6.75-litre twin-turbo V12, enhanced to 602 horsepower by Mansory. The bespoke widebody kit, carbon fibre bumpers, and elite presence make it a showpiece and mobile lounge for dignitary-related duties.Fitted specifically for Dubai Police, this €280,000 SUV includes sirens, emergency equipment, and a weapon-safe box. With 666 horsepower and a top speed over 300 km/h, it blends supercar speed with tactical utility.A recent addition representing the shift to electric mobility, the Cybertruck reportedly generates over 800 horsepower, accelerates to 100 km/h in under four seconds, and reaches estimated top speeds around 210 km/h. Its futuristic design aligns perfectly with Dubai’s branding strategy.Dubai’s electric ambitions continue with this sleek EV, introduced during the Arabian Travel Market 2023. It boasts 646 horsepower, a range of 472 km, and can fast charge from 5% to 80% in just 22.5 minutes. Used primarily in tourist zones, it also offers information and assistance to the public.This V8 grand tourer produces 542 horsepower and 770 Nm of torque, reaching 100 km/h in under 3.9 seconds. Designed for elite visibility and event-based security, it’s one of the most luxurious models in active rotation.Dubai Police’s first Chinese EV, this full-size luxury SUV features adaptive cruise control, a facial recognition interface, and acoustic alert systems. It marks the beginning of deeper tech integration into Dubai’s law enforcement strategy.Extremely rare and incredibly powerful, this 7.3-litre V12 supercar generates 750 horsepower and accelerates to 100 km/h in 3.7 seconds. Only 77 units were produced globally, making this one of the rarest police cars ever.Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8, this British supercar hits a top speed of 333 km/h and exemplifies mechanical precision. It’s used for ceremonial events and official showcases.With a 6.3-litre V12 engine producing 651 horsepower, the Ferrari FF was designed in part with input from Michael Schumacher . It combines grand touring luxury with elite performance and a nod to Italian engineering.Another Mansory-tuned SUV, this G63 boasts 710 horsepower and off-road capabilities, blending utility with visual impact. It's built for both terrain patrol and urban presence.This luxury performance coupe produces 467 horsepower from its 5.0-litre V8 and reaches 273 km/h in 4.4 seconds. Acquired for AED 250,000, it’s a sleek, fast, and budget-conscious performance car.Based on the Chevrolet Tahoe and developed by W Motors, the Ghiath features real-time facial recognition, an AI surveillance system, and integrated command tools. Ten are currently in service, with plans to scale up to 400 units.Each of these serves a distinct purpose, whether for high-speed response, desert patrol, ceremonial display, or community engagement.A revolutionary eVTOL vehicle capable of hovering 5 meters above the ground and flying at 96 km/h. With a flight time of 10–25 minutes (manual) and up to 40 minutes autonomously, this quadcopter bike is part of Dubai’s vision of airborne law enforcement.Introduced in 2014, these eco-friendly bikes are used in malls, events, and high-traffic zones. They combine agility with sustainability and are often favored for their silent, quick mobility.Dubai Police maintains a mounted unit for night patrols in communities such as Al Qusais, Mirdif, and Jumeirah. Operational since 1976, this unit plays ceremonial and community-building roles.Used primarily for aerial surveillance, crowd control, and emergency response. These aircraft are deployed during major events, cross-border monitoring, and disaster preparedness operations.The Dubai Police fleet is more than an indulgence in wealth,it’s a strategic tool of statecraft, law enforcement, and soft power.In a city synonymous with ambition, opulence, and vision, the Dubai Police fleet functions as a bridge between symbolism and service. From the Bugatti Veyron to the Scorpion hoverbike, every vehicle in this unmatched fleet is part of a grander strategy,to redefine public safety as not just a necessity, but an experience. Whether it’s winning the hearts of tourists or showcasing the technological might of the UAE, Dubai has ensured its police vehicles are as unforgettable as the city itself.","Dubai Police use supercars like Bugatti Veyron and Rolls-Royce Cullinan to enhance public safety and showcase city’s luxury.

The James Gunn reboot is getting strong reviews and could mark a fresh chapter for DC.

More Than Just a Light Show

The Film: A Quieter, Hopeful Superman



FAQs

Q1. Why did Dubai light up the Burj Khalifa for Superman?

Q2. Can I still see the Superman display?

Q3. What’s special about this Superman movie?





Dubai doesn’t do things halfway, especially when it comes to global pop culture moments. This weekend, to mark the release of James Gunn’s new Superman, the city turned the Burj Khalifa into a superhero beacon.The LED façade lit up with scenes from the movie, including a close-up of David Corenswet as Clark Kent and Superman, with the words “Dubai, look up” flashing across the skyline. It wasn’t subtle, and that was the point. It was bold, clear, and unmistakably Dubai.The promotion, organized by Reel Cinemas, drew crowds downtown and plenty of praise online. One user called it “the best promotion for a movie ever.” Whether or not you agree, it’s hard to argue with the scale.But the Burj Khalifa wasn’t the only place Superman touched down.At the Dubai Mall waterfall, shoppers got a surprise. Nestled among the silver diving statues, a Superman figure made a low-key appearance. The mall leaned into the moment, sharing on Instagram:“Superman just flew into Dubai Mall.”It was small, but effective and added just enough wonder to make people stop and look twice.Meanwhile, over at Ski Dubai, things got cooler.A digital display showed Superman and Krypto soaring above the snowy indoor slopes. The promo invited families to book advance tickets at VOX Cinemas. There was even a screening that allowed pets to join their humans in the theatre. For a film that features Superman’s loyal dog, Krypto, the gesture made sense and it definitely made social media.James Gunn’s take on Superman isn’t just another reboot. It’s a reset. Starring David Corenswet as a more grounded, thoughtful Clark Kent, the movie leans into emotional beats rather than just big action.Critics have responded well. The film holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with reviewers calling it a “fresh start” and praising its emotional depth. It’s not trying to be the biggest superhero movie ever, it’s trying to bring heart back to the franchise.And it seems to be working. Globally, the movie opened to $217 million in its first weekend, including strong numbers in the UAE and across the region.It was part of a local promotional campaign tied to the film’s global release. Dubai often uses the Burj Khalifa for major entertainment launches, from Marvel movies to concerts.The Burj Khalifa show was a timed activation. However, events at Dubai Mall and Ski Dubai may continue through July, depending on footfall and cinema schedules.Directed by James Gunn, this version focuses more on Clark Kent’s humanity and less on destruction and spectacle. It’s being positioned as the starting point for a new, connected DC universe.","Dubai celebrated the new Superman film by lighting up Burj Khalifa with clips from the movie.

Q: Can I stay beyond 90 days without a problem?

Q: What happens if I don't exit within 30 days?

Q: How many times can I use the exit extension?

Q: Can I re-enter Saudi with a new visa during the 30-day period?





In late June 2025, Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Passports (Jawazat) unveiled a groundbreaking policy, visit visa holders whose visas expire can now request a 30-day exit permit via the Absher platform and its Tawasul service. After paying any outstanding fines, this grant allows legal departure without punishment.Previously, overstayers faced immediate fines or arrest. This policy signals a new approach: balancing enforcement with flexibility for those delayed by travel issues, health concerns, or emergencies .Exiting under the grace period is crucial. Overstaying beyond 30 days results in harsh penalties:Although intended for Hajj and Umrah peak periods, these rules now apply tovisit visa holder, year-round.Eligible individuals include holders of expired tourist, business, or family visit visas and Umrah visas—applicable once per person.Note the exceptions:The grace policy is part of an ongoing effort to digitize Saudi's immigration infrastructure:Saudi Arabia’s shift reflects a larger move under Vision 2030, using technology to streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and clamp down on irregular visa cases. Modernisation goals include:For expats and sponsors, this means compliance is real-time and transparent.Now excuses like “I did not know” won’t hold water once Absher sends the alert.The exit window policy is not an isolated change. Saudi recently introduced skill-based visas, which:Together, these reforms present a Saudi Arabia in transition, moving from rigid control toward flexible, skill-based mobility.Failure to comply will restore older penalties; fines, bans, and possible jail time.Saudi Arabia’s new 30-day exit grace period, integrated with digital systems, marks a fresh and fairer approach to immigration. Pairing this with skill-based visa reforms signals readiness to shift from arbitrary control to a more transparent, performance-driven, and global profile. Still, this grace is not a loophole, time matters, and overstays bring serious consequences. As Saudi modernizes, staying informed and compliant will be vital for every visitor.Saudi Arabia is making visa compliance automatic and shared not only for visitors but also for those who manage their immigration status. By combining in Absher with stiff penalties, the government is sending a message. Sponsors and expats now share responsibility, and mistakes can be costly.Only if your visit visa was still valid. Overstaying beyond expiry even within 90 days of entry relies on the 30-day exit application.You may face fines up to SAR 50,000, jail up to six months, deportation, and likely a multi-year re-entry ban.Only once per applicant, tied to their expired visa.No. This window is strictly for exit only.","Saudi Arabia introduced a 30-day grace period effective June 26 for expired visit visas.

Q1. How can I tell if a Wi-Fi network is a honeypot?

Q2. Is using a VPN enough to stay safe on public Wi-Fi?

Q3. What should I do if I suspect I’ve connected to a fake Wi-Fi hotspot?





When you travel abroad, connecting to free Wi-Fi in airports, hotels, or cafés seems harmless. It’s fast, easy, and usually part of the plan. But that free internet can come with hidden dangers you might not expect. Many UAE residents don’t realize that cybercriminals can use these networks against them.Hackers create fake Wi-Fi networks that look legitimate. These traps are called honeypots. They trick users into connecting so hackers can steal sensitive data like passwords, emails, or even banking details. Unlike a visible virus or attack, this kind of threat is silent. You might never know you’ve been targeted.Even real public Wi-Fi isn’t always safe. Many lack strong security, making it easier for hackers to eavesdrop or push malware to your device. The UAE Cyber Security Council warns travelers to be cautious and protect their digital lives.A honeypot is a fake Wi-Fi network set up by hackers. It looks like a normal public network, think “Airport_Free_WiFi” or “Hotel_Guest.” But when you connect, your data can be intercepted. Hackers can watch your online activity, steal passwords, or even access your private messages.These fake hotspots are dangerous because they don’t require passwords or verification. They are designed to be attractive so you’ll join quickly, without thinking twice.This is one of the most common ways hackers steal your data on public Wi-Fi. Imagine you’re talking to a friend, but someone else secretly listens in and can even change the conversation.

They can capture your login info, credit card numbers, or private messages. And since it happens quietly, you usually won’t notice until it’s too late.Public Wi-Fi networks, even real ones, usually don’t use strong encryption. Encryption is like a lock for your data. Without it, anyone nearby can listen to your internet traffic. Hackers can inject malware or redirect you to fake websites designed to steal your information.Also, many public networks require you to agree to terms and conditions before connecting. These agreements sometimes give the network permission to track your location, monitor your browsing habits, or collect personal data.

TL;DR

13 people died in e-scooter and e-bike incidents in Dubai in early 2025, triggering bans in some areas.

E-scooters offer vital transport options for residents who don’t drive, especially in large communities.

Instead of banning, a mix of education, licensing, and clear rules could make streets safer for everyone.

Education & Licensing or Banning?



Safety risks: Riders often ignore traffic rules.

Pedestrian danger: Scooters zip through crowded sidewalks.

No system to hold reckless riders accountable.

The argument for licensing and education

Not everyone can afford a car or taxi.

E-scooters are practical for short trips in large communities.

More Balanced Solutions: What Could Work Instead of a Ban?

Mandatory Licensing or Permit System: Riders must pass a short safety course and get a digital permit. This filters out riders who don’t understand road rules.

Cannot block doors, aisles, or seats.

No wet, dirty, or damaged scooters.

The Debate Over Freedom and Safety: What’s the Real Solution?

FAQs

Q1. Are e-scooters banned everywhere in Dubai now?

Q2. Can I take my e-scooter on the Metro?

Q3. Do I need a license to ride an e-scooter in Dubai?





Dubai is seeing a sharp rise in e-scooter and e-bike accidents. In just the first five months of 2025, 13 people lost their lives in micromobility-related incidents. That’s already more than the 10 deaths recorded in all of 2024. In response, some neighbourhoods, including Victory Heights and Jumeirah Beach Residence have banned e-scooters completely.But for many residents, especially those without cars, e-scooters are more than a trend. They're a necessity. In communities like Green Community DIP-1, riding one can cut a 20-minute walk down to 3 minutes, a big deal in Dubai's summer heat.The current approach feels all-or-nothing. Either full freedom or total bans. But the issue might not be the vehicles themselves, it’s the lack of consistent rules, awareness, and enforcement.So the real question is: do we need more bans, or just better systems?Right now, anyone aged 16 or above can ride an e-scooter in Dubai. Helmets are mandatory, but you’ll often see people riding without them. There’s no requirement for training, testing, or understanding the rules of the road.The argument for banningThe problem is often poor behavior not the scooters themselves.A structured training or licensing system could help filter out unsafe riders, much like we do with cars. Without that, people will continue riding without the knowledge to do it safely.Instead of banning scooters outright, here’s what a more measured approach could look like:In October 2025, the RTA lifted its ban on e-scooters aboard public transport, allowing foldable models on the Metro and Tram under strict safety conditions.This move shows that the city isn’t anti-scooter, it just wants clear safety measures in place.This issue comes down to balance. On one side: people’s right to use simple, affordable transport. On the other: the public’s right to feel safe in shared spaces.Banning all scooters because of a few bad riders may be a quick fix, but it’s not a long-term answer. The better path might be tougher to build, it requires laws, education, awareness, and real enforcement but it’s fairer. And it actually solves the root of the problem.No. Only some residential areas have banned them. You can still ride in approved zones and public roads where allowed by the RTA.Yes, but only if it’s foldable and you follow all RTA rules (like keeping it off, clean, and not blocking doors).As of now, no license is required. But there are growing calls for a formal training or permit system to improve safety.","13 people died in e-scooter and e-bike incidents in Dubai in early 2025, triggering bans in some areas.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Apple's former design director warns: Bring the culture, not the habits



“I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple... That’s not really where Pinterest was at the time.”

Why ""slowing down"" matters when you join a new team



“When you go into a new culture, you need to slow down, deeply observe, don’t judge or compare.”

Starting a new job can feel like being dropped into a foreign country. You know the role, you know the company name, but the culture? That’s invisible. Former Apple design director Bob Baxley learned this the hard way when he jumped straight from Apple to Pinterest—“Friday to Monday”—and his Apple instincts clashed with Pinterest norms. He calls it being caught in Apple’s cultural imprint, or what Steve Jobs playfully dubbed “the Apple car wash.”According to Baxley, the biggest mistake people make on day one is not pausing to reset. Here’s why slowing down—and learning how to blend your past strengths with your new setting—is essential for your career success.Baxley shared how he “bounced off” Pinterest by carrying over Apple’s direct and intense style—an environment he thrived in at Cupertino but didn’t translate elsewhere. He said:He describes Apple’s culture as a “really powerful” imprint that sticks around long after you leave. To adapt effectively, Baxley recommends adopting a “personal period of adjustment”—a “car wash” to rinse off old workplace behaviours.In fast-paced industries—especially tech—you might not get a delay between jobs. But Baxley says that even then, you can buffer:That means listening more than speaking early on, watching how decisions are made, and noticing norms around communication, feedback, and risk. This approach keeps you from stepping on toes.Baxley isn’t saying throw away your toolbox—just be strategic about using it. He notes that your former employer hired you for your values—such as focus, detail, or creative rigour—but not necessarily for your past behaviours.So the key: pause, rethink, and ask yourself:That alignment not only earns you credibility, it also avoids cultural misfires.Baxley points to Hiroki Asai—a former Apple marketing VP who took several years off before joining Airbnb—as a good example. That “rewirement” gave him time to recalibrate his mindset, easing the cultural transition.If you can’t take a break, you can still mimic the effect by spending your first few weeks observing, learning, and asking questions—instead of immediately implementing.Even beyond tech, starting a new job often means tripping over invisible cultural patterns. Reddit users in r/Accounting recently shared first-week mistakes like rushing into tasks without checking procedures, then hiding them—it’s normal. The advice? Own your mistakes, document clearly, and ask for feedback early.This aligns with Baxley’s core tip: slow down, ask clarifying questions like ""Can you walk me through your preferred process?"" and adjust before acting.","Apple's former design director warns: Bring the culture, not the habits.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Company morale hits rock bottom amid restructuring

Microsoft 's King division, the developers of popular game Candy Crush, had laid off around 200 employees, and now these human workers will reportedly be replaced by artificial intelligence tools they helped create, according to multiple sources speaking to. This comes as Microsoft pushed its gaming division into broader restructuring, cutting thousands of jobs across Xbox and its subsidiaries earlier this month.Designers, user researchers, UX writers, and narrative copywriters who spent years building and training these AI systems, are the ones now being replaced for now. King's London-based Farm Heroes Saga team also faces severe cuts, with sources indicating about 50 people, roughly half the team, will be made redundant, including key leadership positions.""Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker,"" said one King staffer speaking anonymously to. ""Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating.""The situation has created widespread frustration among remaining employees. ""The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it's all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall,"" the same source continued. ""If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership.""Sources indicate the total number of cuts may exceed the initially reported 200 positions, with centralized staff in research and quality assurance also being eliminated. A recent internal employee survey conducted before the layoffs showed morale was already at an all-time low, with one person familiar with the results saying it's now ""in the gutter.""The restructuring affects King's offices in London, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Berlin, with many employees remaining in limbo throughout the summer as union negotiations continue. Senior staff have been placed on gardening leave ahead of expected September departures.","Microsoft's King division, the developers of popular game Candy Crush, laid off around 200 employees.

Microsoft will stop offering new Office features to these Windows users starting August 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-will-stop-offering-new-office-features-to-these-windows-users-starting-august-2026/articleshow/122569788.cms,"Security updates continue but feature development stops

Windows 11 upgrade becomes essential for latest Office tools

Microsoft has quietly announced it will stop delivering new features to Office apps for Windows 10 users starting in August 2026, marking another significant step in the company's push to migrate users to Windows 11. While security updates will continue until October 2028, the feature freeze effectively forces users seeking the latest Office capabilities to upgrade their operating system.The timeline varies by subscription type: Microsoft 365 Personal and Family users will lose access to new features with version 2608 in August 2026, while enterprise customers face cutoffs between October 2026 and January 2027 depending on their update channel. All versions will remain frozen at the 2608 feature set regardless of subscription tier.Microsoft's decision represents a significant shift from its previous commitments. The company had originally planned to end Office support alongside Windows 10's October 2025 end-of-life date but reversed course earlier this year following user backlash. However, as The Verge first reported, the company failed to initially disclose that new features would be restricted starting in 2026.The change means Windows 10 users experiencing Office issues unique to their platform will receive limited support. Microsoft's official guidance directs such users to upgrade to Windows 11, with support staff providing only ""troubleshooting assistance"" and warning that ""technical workarounds might be limited or unavailable.""This move aligns with Microsoft's broader strategy to accelerate Windows 11 adoption. Despite Windows 11 recently overtaking Windows 10 as the most-used desktop OS, millions of devices still run the older system. The company has offered various incentives for upgrading, including free extended security updates for Windows 10 users who enable Windows Backup or pay $30 per device.For users unwilling or unable to upgrade, Office web apps will remain an alternative for accessing new features. However, the desktop experience will remain static after August 2026, creating a two-tiered system where modern Office capabilities require Windows 11.",Microsoft will stop delivering new features to Office apps for Windows 10 users starting in August 2026.

AI Appreciation Day , observed annually on July 16, celebrates the transformative power of artificial intelligence in shaping our world. From enhancing healthcare diagnostics to streamlining business operations, AI drives efficiency and innovation across industries. This day honors the researchers, engineers, and visionaries who advance AI technologies, making life more connected and insightful. It’s also a moment to reflect on ethical AI development, ensuring inclusivity and fairness. Here's what some industry leaders have to say on AI’s contributions and potential:On AI Appreciation Day, we celebrate the incredible strides AI has made in reshaping industries and enhancing daily life. While the challenges of coding complexity and data volume continue to grow, the opportunities to innovate, improve efficiency, and make smarter decisions are limitless. As AI evolves, it paves the way for a brighter, more intelligent future for all.As we celebrate AI Appreciation Day, it’s clear that people expect more from smart brands than just automated features - they’re seeking technology that understands, adapts, and truly adds value to their daily lives. In India, we’re witnessing a remarkable evolution: consumers are moving past surface-level AI toward solutions that address authentic challenges and drive meaningful improvements.Over the last few years, AI has become a crucial component driving bold transformations. By cutting through complexity, it empowers faster, smarter decisions that drive real business outcomes. The future belongs to organisations that align people, purpose, and plans to harness AI’s full potential. Operational excellence is just the beginning; inclusive intelligence is the destination.AI is fundamentally reshaping how businesses operate and innovate within India’s fast-paced digital economy. Today, embracing AI has become essential for keeping pace with evolving industry demands and unlocking new opportunities. One of the clearest signs of AI’s growing influence is the wave of entrepreneurial interest in the area.On AI Appreciation Day, we're reminded that the true power of artificial intelligence lies not in complexity, but in its ability to intuitively simplify our lives. The best AI quietly adapts to people learning preferences, enhancing comfort, and making everyday living more efficient from behind the scenes.It is not an overstatement to say that the adoption of AI is moving at breakneck speed. The ease of using generative AI to create and enhance content is having a far-reaching impact on people’s lives. AI tools and capabilities continue to evolve. Unfortunately, the AI-based tools that are powering innovation, productivity, and efficiency in business are also being used by cyber attackers to develop and scale increasingly complex, sophisticated, and evasive cyber threats. Organisations need their own, powerful multimodal AI security that can detect and neutralize AI-based attacks regardless of whether they are delivered in an image or a QR code, and even if the language and sender seem completely legitimate.AI’s real promise lies in augmenting—not replacing—human capability. We are entering an era of Dual Intelligence, where the combination of human judgment and machine precision creates exponential value. Whether it’s transforming enterprise data into decisions or enabling an AI-ready workforce, the focus must remain on purposeful application. AI Appreciation Day is a timely reminder that the future of innovation is rooted in collaboration between people and intelligent systems, driving outcomes that are scalable, ethical, and inclusive.AI has already started to change how people experience their personal devices. Much like how smartphones transformed how we connect, AI is now powering a shift in how we create, work, and interact with PCs. The focus is moving beyond performance towards building machines that are more intuitive, ones that understand, evaluate, and adapt to the user experience in real time. We’re seeing everyday tasks become smarter, creative workflows get faster, and personalisation move to an entirely new level. Early AI PC benchmarks have shown up to 40% better battery efficiency and significant performance gains in AI-accelerated tasks.","AI Appreciation Day, observed annually on July 16, celebrates the transformative power of artificial intelligence in shaping our world.
