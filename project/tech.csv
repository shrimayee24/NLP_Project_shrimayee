Winnipeg Jets are willing to make a serious commitment

Where could Jonathan Toews end up next season? | OverDrive Clips | 06/11/25

Colorado Avalanche still strongly in the mix



Jonathan Toews is expected to decide soon as negotiations begin.



Jonathan Toews is inching closer to a highly anticipated NHL comeback. Once eyed by four teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning, he has reportedly cut his list in half. Now, all eyes are on two Western Conference teams, the Winnipeg Jets and Colorado Avalanche, as Toews prepares to negotiate a deal.Toews returning to his hometown is more than just a feel-good narrative; it’s now a serious possibility. For Winnipeg, bringing in Toews would not only boost leadership and experience but also serve as a powerful symbol for the franchise. With the team looking to re-establish itself as a strong postseason contender, Toews could be the missing piece that stabilizes the locker room and adds playoff grit.While the Jets offer sentiment and hometown appeal, the Colorado Avalanche bring title ambitions. Despite earlier assumptions that the Avalanche had moved on after acquiring Brock Nelson, Dreger clarified that his Colorado sources insisted they remain very, very interested in Toews. The front office views him as a cultural fit who can strengthen their leadership group.The Avalanche are still hunting another deep playoff run, and a healthy Toews could add the veteran savvy they lacked last season.With uncertainty around their bottom six and leadership depth, Toews’ return could round out their roster.Toews’ comeback story has moved from speculation to strategy. With a decision reportedly between just two teams, negotiations are expected to begin in earnest. The timing suggests he wants a deal wrapped up before the July 1 free agency window, allowing him to integrate into his new team early.Read more: Who is Quinn Hughes girlfriend?

"Donald Trump launches smartphone after threatening Apple, Samsung with tariffs: What T1 Phone 8002 phone’s listing tells and does not",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-launches-smartphone-after-threatening-apple-samsung-with-tariffs-what-t1-phone-8002-phones-listing-tells-and-does-not/articleshow/121900965.cms,"Specifications of T1 Phone 8002: What the listing page tells and what it does not



Why Trump’s America-made T1 Mobile is a far-fetched reality



President Donald Trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, Trump Mobile, just weeks after threatening Apple and Samsung with steep tariffs unless they move production to the United States. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his ""America First"" manufacturing rhetoric while offering consumers a domestic alternative to foreign-made devices.Donald Trump's flagship device, the T1 Phone 8002 (Gold version), carries a $499 price tag and can be reserved with a $100 down payment for September delivery. The phone is marketed as ""designed and built in the USA,"" positioning it as the patriotic choice Trump has been demanding from major manufacturers.The launch comes after Trump's May threat to impose ""at least 25 percent"" tariffs on iPhones and similar devices manufactured overseas. He specifically targeted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating that iPhones sold in America must be manufactured domestically, not in India or elsewhere. Trump extended the tariff threat to ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product,"" as he told White House reporters, with implementation potentially beginning at the end of June. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his broader commitment to reshoring technology manufacturing.The T1 Phone 8002 boasts some impressive hardware for its price, including a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, 256GB storage, 12GB RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery. The device features three rear cameras led by a 50MP main sensor, Android 15, and notably includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rarity among modern smartphones.However, the Trump Mobile website doesn't tell much about the smartphone, and displays what appears to be heavily manipulated product images. No processor is listed despite a dedicated section on the specifications page, a critical omission for any smartphone launch.Industry observers note that the September delivery timeline seems optimistic given the typical 12-18 month development cycle for new smartphones. The Trump Mobile venture requires customers to place $100 deposits for pre-orders, with the remainder due upon delivery.Trump's assertion that the phone is manufactured domestically contradicts industry consensus about smartphone production capabilities in the United States. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that domestic iPhone production faces significant infrastructure and supply chain challenges.Currently, virtually no smartphone manufacturers, including those based in the US, produce their devices on American soil. The complex supply chains and specialized manufacturing capabilities required for modern smartphones remain concentrated in Asia, particularly China, despite ongoing efforts by companies like Apple to diversify production to countries like India.","Donald Trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, Trump Mobile.

AI Godfather Geoffrey Hinton’s chilling warning: AI could replace you unless you are a...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hintons-chilling-warning-ai-could-replace-you-unless-you-are-a-/articleshow/121906996.cms,"AI godfather Geoffrey Hinton’s chilling warning

AI Godfather’s urgent warning: Want job security? Learn plumbing

A personal warning from the AI Godfather

Office jobs face AI pressure, says ‘Godfather of AI’

Growing inequality could be the real problem

A future that’s still unwritten

In a world moving quickly toward automation, one of the creators of modern artificial intelligence is raising serious concerns about what happens next. Geoffrey Hinton , the British-Canadian computer scientist often called the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk—and which ones might survive.Hinton, who helped lay the foundation for AI systems that now power everything from chatbots to medical tools, left his role at Google in 2023. Since then, he’s been speaking more freely about the risks of the technology he helped create. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett, Hinton discussed the future of work in a world shaped by powerful machines. And in a surprising turn, he said there’s one career path that may be safer than most: plumbing.While talking about the risks of AI, Hinton made a simple point: machines are good at thinking, not at fixing pipes. “It’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us,” he said. “A good bet would be to be a plumber.”Plumbing is hard to automate. It involves manual skill, real-world judgment, and problem-solving in unpredictable settings. A plumber might need to crawl under a sink, deal with unusual water pressure, or fix something without a manual. These aren’t tasks AI systems are built to handle.According to Hinton, jobs that rely on hands-on skills are less likely to be taken over by AI anytime soon. While machines can handle large amounts of data and even draft documents, they still can’t climb ladders or tighten valves. That gives trade jobs—especially ones like plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry—an edge in the AI era.Now 77, Hinton didn’t try to hide how conflicted he feels. He admitted that he’s still processing the full consequences of his work. “Intellectually, you can see the threat,” he said. “But it’s very hard to come to terms with it emotionally.”He said he worries about the future his children and grandchildren might face. In the interview, he painted a picture that was both realistic and unsettling. He talked about a world where AI systems could eventually control power plants and critical infrastructure. If these systems become fully independent, they may not need people at all.“If AI ever decided to take over,” he warned, “it would need people for a while to run the power stations—until it designed better analog machines… There are so many ways it could get rid of people, all of which would, of course, be very nasty.”Hinton didn’t say this will happen. But he made it clear that it could. And in his view, that’s reason enough to take it seriously.While plumbers may be safe for now, Hinton believes many office jobs won’t be. He pointed to legal assistants and paralegals as some of the first roles being reshaped by AI.These jobs often involve reviewing contracts, analyzing documents, or summarizing information—all tasks that large language models can already handle. With AI tools now able to draft legal text and even predict case outcomes, the need for human support roles in law firms could shrink.Hinton wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He was simply stating what the data shows. “In a society which shared out things fairly, everybody should be better off,” he said. “But if you can replace lots of people by AIs, then the people who get replaced will be worse off.”In other words, the shift may boost productivity, but it might not help everyone equally.Beyond the risks of job loss, Hinton pointed to a deeper issue: inequality. As companies adopt AI, many workers may be pushed out, while only a small group—those who own or run these companies—stand to benefit.If not managed carefully, this could lead to a wider gap between rich and poor. People in manual jobs may still find work, but others—especially those in mid-level white-collar roles—may struggle to adapt.And while AI might create new jobs, Hinton warned that the pace of change could be too fast for many to keep up.Hinton’s message wasn’t meant to scare people. It was meant to make them think. He didn’t claim to know how the future will unfold. But he said it’s time to have an honest conversation about what’s coming.For now, the most valuable skills may not be digital ones—but physical ones. Fixing a leak, rewiring a switchboard, or installing a water heater might be harder to replace than people think.And that’s something worth remembering.","Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk.

Experienced addition to a reshuffled unit



Fitting into Matt Eberflus' evolving system



The Dallas Cowboys have added Super Bowl-winning cornerback Robert Rochell on a one-year deal, reinforcing a secondary facing depth questions ahead of training camp. With Trevon Diggs rehabbing and key veterans gone, Rochell’s arrival signals Dallas isn’t waiting for problems to surface. The move was first reported by NFL insider Adam Schefter. Rochell joins a defense undergoing key adjustments under new leadership.Robert Rochell was drafted by the Rams in 2021 and won a Super Bowl in his rookie year. He brings size (6'0"", 195 lbs), athleticism, and scheme versatility to the cornerback group. Though used mostly as a rotational player, he has logged reps on defense and special teams. His recent stints with the Packers and Panthers kept him active in NFL circles.The Cowboys' secondary took hits this offseason with Jourdan Lewis leaving in free agency. Trevon Diggs continues recovering from a knee injury, and rookie Shavon Revel is rehabbing too. This has left Dallas searching for stable backups behind their headline names. Rochell provides coverage depth while competition heats up in camp.New defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus is emphasizing speed, turnovers, and flexibility in the backfield.Players like DaRon Bland and Kaïir Elam are expected to play expanded roles this season. Rochell’s adaptability gives him a chance to fit into sub-packages or emergency starts. He’s not guaranteed a roster spot but will have every chance to prove value.Also read: Netflix’s ‘America’s Team-The Gambler and His Cowboys’ fuels debate among fans as Cowboys’ title drought nears 30 years The Cowboys have made this signing ahead of July’s full-squad camp kickoff.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

A New York couple is finally having a baby after almost two decades of failing to conceive a long, emotionally trying, physically draining, and medically frustrating ride. Their story, foiled by 15 failed IVF treatments and consultations from experts on every continent, was redeemed by an AI-based fertility tool designed at Columbia University. It's a breathtaking medical milestone that could change the face of treatment for male infertility globally.The long-awaited pregnancy of the couple is not only a medical success; it's a victory of endurance, ingenuity, and the ability of technology to overcome very intimate kinds of difficulties. For those with apparently insurmountable barriers, this case provides something invaluable: hope.With the help of AI, the era of reproductive health is about to experience a breakthrough period where even the most challenging fertility situations can be addressed not with desperation, but with data, precision, and empathy.For the majority of couples, fertility treatments are emotionally and financially exhausting—if not more so when they are unsuccessful time and time again. This couple was no exception. They struggled for nearly 20 years to have a biological child. Even with access to cutting-edge fertility treatment, surgeries, and international consultations, they were consistently given the same message: conception was all but impossible.The fundamental problem was with the husband, whom the doctor diagnosed with azoospermia , a rare but serious condition where no sperm is present in the ejaculate.Just when hope appeared to be lost, the couple approached Dr. Zev Williams, a fertility specialist at Columbia University , whose team had been developing a cutting-edge technology: Sperm Track and Recovery (STAR).The AI system was developed to identify good sperm in semen samples where previously none were seen.In this New York couple's situation, standard lab technicians spent two entire days searching through the semen sample, but couldn't locate a single sperm cell. STAR located 44 viable sperm, though, within an hour—a figure large enough to continue with in-vitro fertilization (IVF).Miraculously, the pair did not require further cycles of hormonal treatment or surgery. With the sperm isolated by STAR, the IVF cycle went smoothly in March 2025. It worked—and the pair is now pregnant with their first child. Dr. Williams noted that the case is by no means a fluke. STAR has the potential to overturn fertility treatment, particularly for men with non-obstructive azoospermia.Affects 1 in 6 people worldwide, states the World Health Organization, and male infertility accounts for roughly 50% of these. For many, diagnosis of azoospermia seemed the end of the road until now.Whereas STAR today solves sperm detection, scientists think AI can revolutionize many other aspects of fertility treatment as well:""There are things happening that we are not aware of now,"" said Dr. Williams. ""But with AI, we can finally observe them.""Azoospermia occurs in about 1 in 100 men and is responsible for 10–15% of male infertility. It exists in two types:Some common reasons are:Conventional therapies for azoospermia usually include risky operations to harvest sperm directly from the testes or using donor sperm—both of which pose emotional and ethical challenges for most couples.","A New York couple is finally having a baby after almost two decades of failing to conceive.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Xbox Games Showcase 2025 Highlights: Biggest Game Reveals, New Consoles & More!

Google’s Veo 3 model now powers AI video generation on Canva, the company announced in a press release today. The new feature allows users to generate 8-second video clips with synchronized audio using voice or text prompts in a single workflow. The tool is available to Canva’s paid and nonprofit users as well as Leonardo.Ai subscribers (starting at $10/month). For those unaware, Leonardo.Ai is owned by Canva. The integration brings cinematic-style video creation to millions without the need for specialized software or skills.To recall, Google released the Veo 3 tool last month at I/O 2025. The AI-powered video generation tool allows users to generate videos from text and image prompts. This includes speech such as dialogues and voice-overs; and audio, such as music and sound effects.Canva also revealed its plan to acquire MagicBrief, an AI-driven creative platform used by marketing and design teams worldwide. Both announcements highlight Canva’s growing investment in AI-powered content creation and creative tools.Cameron Adams, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Canva said: “Enabling anyone to bring their ideas to life – especially their most creative ones – has been core to Canva's mission ever since we set out to empower the world to design.

The AI video tool is coming later this summer.Mohan said “The possibilities with AI are limitless. A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution.”He continued “My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers. Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”","Google’s Veo 3 model now powers AI video generation on Canva.

Orphaned cheetahs named Taylor and Travis find comfort—and love—in each other

In a heartwarming twist straight out of a fairy tale, two orphaned cheetah cubs rescued from the illegal wildlife trade are making headlines—not just for surviving, but for thriving together. Named Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce , the adorable duo has formed an inseparable bond at a conservation center in Somaliland, sparkling smiles and a wild ‘Love Story’ of their own.At the Cheetah Conservation Fund's sanctuary, a heartwarming narrative of friendship and survival is playing out. It all began with a tiny cheetah cub, fittingly named Taylor Swift in a nod to the beloved popstar superstar.This resilient cub, weighing a mere three pounds upon her arrival this past April, was a lucky rescue from the clutches of the illegal wildlife pet trade. Brought to the Cheetah Rescue and Conservation Centre in Somaliland, she swiftly adapted to her secure new home, thriving under the dedicated care provided by the staff.The center recently welcomed four new residents—a litter of orphaned siblings, also saved from the same unfortunate circumstances of illegal wildlife trafficking. These new arrivals were gently introduced to Taylor Swift once they had settled into their new surroundings.Among them, a particular male cub quickly caught Taylor's attention, and a significant bond began to blossom between the two.Observing this flourishing friendship, the staff at the cheetah center made a charming and fitting decision: they named the 5-month-old male cub Travis Kelce, inspired by the well-known athlete. According to the center, this cheetah, Travis Kelce, embodies qualities similar to his namesake, described as ""playful, confident, and has a winning streak.”The delightful bond between the two cubs has not gone unnoticed. As the center's staff shared in a statement, ""Not only is [cub Taylor Swift] thriving, it looks like we have a little Love Story unfolding on the savannah."" They further emphasized the depth of the two cub's connection, stating, ""The two have become nearly inseparable—grooming each other, napping side by side, and occasionally partaking in friendly roughhousing. ""The male cub's ""rookie stats"" include an approximate sitting height of 50 cm and a length of about 90 cm, along with impressive abilities like ""climbing trees, running fast [and] scarfing down snacks."" It's clear that this young male cheetah is also ""fiercely protective of the things he likes most,"" a sentiment that undeniably includes his dear friend, Taylor Swift, the cheetah cub.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift inspire each other to grow as Erin Andrews dubs her with sweet new nickname Isn't it amazing how these two rescued cubs found each other and formed such a special bond? As these two ""superstar"" cheetahs thrive together, their story reminds us that sometimes, the most unexpected pairings lead to the most enduring love stories.Recently, teh American popstar Taylor Swift visited Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. and talked with some patients who were huge Swifties. When a patient asked her why she was there in Florida, the pop singer replied, “My boyfriend is training here. So I just thought I’d come and see how you’re doing. Just drop in on you, you know what I mean?”","Two orphaned cheetah cubs rescued from the illegal wildlife trade are making headlines.
