Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

He who, without raising doubt, can sense what lies hidden in another’s heart—

He is equal to the divine

Life is a grand, unpredictable game. And in this game, strategy is not optional—it is survival. And at the heart of every great strategy lies one powerful ability – the art of reading others.Be it a chessboard or a boardroom, the first move toward mastery is watching for subtle rhythms people unknowingly adopt.One of my favourite illustrations of this is from a classic Vadivelu comedy. He disguises himself in an array of costumes, yet his friends recognize him instantly. Exasperated, he asks, ""How did you know it was me?"" Their answer is simple: “You forgot to hide your trademark beehive hair.” (And isn’t that true for us all? No matter how clever the mask, our patterns betray us.Consider tennis in the 1990s. A young, fiery Boris Becker stunned audiences with his serves—earning the nickname. When he first clashed with Andre Agassi, a master of returns, Becker triumphed easily in the first three matches.But soon, something changed.In their next eleven matches, Agassi won nine times. Years later, Agassi revealed the secret. After the losses, he started watchingof Becker’s matches obsessively and noticed that just before serving, Becker would subtly stick out his tongue. If it pointed right, the serve would follow suit, and vice versa.Agassi saved it for the pivotal moments—break points, set points—when it mattered most. The result? Becker felt, almost eerily, like Agassi could read his mind. When Agassi disclosed the truth post retirement, Becker could only laugh in disbelief.In the game of life, we’re always playing with and against others. Reading them doesn’t just give us an edge—it prepares us.There’s an African saying:Strategy isn’t only about planning. It’s the subtle art of reading your opponent’s motives, not just their moves. Their fears. Their hopes.The Japanese have a word for this—In the business world, Yomi has worked wonders. Consider the curious case of the ‘new Coke’. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola introduced a new formula with a different taste. Thousands of customers wrote letters of complaint. Eventually, the company “listened” and reintroduced the original Coke.Sales soared.Some industry veterans still believe it was all part of a larger plan. Coca-Colataking something away would reignite affection for it. If true, this wasn’t a product failure—it was strategic brilliance.Even Thiruvalluvar, centuries ago, revered this gift. In, he writes:The greatest strategists are not always the loudest or the boldest. They are the ones who quietly listen, observe, and understand. They hide their beehive hair. They watch for the tongue’s direction. They think like rats to catch them. And in doing so, they play not just the game, but the minds behind it.So, the next time you find yourself at the crossroads, pause. Observe the patterns. Listen to the silence between the words. In that moment, you will see not just the obvious, but what is hidden —that will lead you to your next move.Then you will fight, with the power of being a part of your opponent’s mind.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120622480,imgsize-46472,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/120622480.jpg"
Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Who is Gabriella Zuniga? The OnlyFans star who sued Shannon Sharpe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-gabriella-zuniga-the-onlyfans-star-who-sued-shannon-sharpe/articleshow/120578272.cms,"Source - X

Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama and speculation to an already chaotic story.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","Gabriella Zuniga is a 20-year-old OnlyFans model.

Shannon Sharpe posts a statement about his sexual assault scandal and gets called “dumb” by his fans



Jane Doe has claimed the relationship between her and Shannon Sharpe was not consensual



Shannon Sharpe, the NFL legend, has been going through a tough time ever since he was accused of sexually assaulting a young woman on multiple occasions. The woman who is using the pseudonym Jane Doe in the media has sued the ESPN host for a whopping $50 million. Shannon Sharpe has strongly denied such claims and has issued a statement about it but fans think his statement was “dumb”.Shannon Sharpe recently posted a screenshot of a text message that he received. This text message is supposedly his official statement on the whole matter.Shannon Sharpe’s statement reads as, “The relationship in question was 100% consensual…I will be devoting this time to my family, and responding and dealing with these false and disruptive allegations set against me. I plan to return to ESPN at the start of the NFL preseason.”The NFL legend has also added that he appreciates the support he has gotten from fans. But now his fans are trolling him for posting a screenshot of a message rather than a statement.A fan commented, “Shannon you’re supposed to copy and paste what the PR team sends you, not screenshot their text of it”, while another fan posted, “Ain’t no way you posted a screenshot instead of copy/pasting the text your lawyer sent you 😂”A third fan commented, “Shannon when your lawyer texted you that he probably didn’t mean post a screenshot. I’m guessing he wanted you to copy and paste it.”Another user commented, “Big dumb ape you were supposed to copy this and post it yourself. Not screenshot your lawyers PR statement for you”, while a fifth fan noted, “You gotta be the dumbest mf ever😭”Another fan posted, “Screenshot is fitting for how poorly you are treating this entire situation. You will never air on ESPN again”, while a seventh fan joked, “Have you reached out to Leonardo Dicaprio for advice on banging 20 year olds in your 50s and not getting extorted?”A few days ago, Shannon Sharpe was sued by this young woman who has claimed that the two had met at a gym in 2023 and the NFL legend sexually assaulted her multiple times.Jane Doe’s lawyers have also leaked the recording of their phone call to various media outlets and has accused Shannon Sharpe of “threatening” the young woman.Shannon Sharpe’s lawyers, in turn, have leaked the sexually explicit texts that were exchanged between the two which shows the relationship was consensual.As Shannon Sharpe deals with this scandal, his fans remain divided on this issue.Also Read: “Put a big black baby in me”: Shannon Sharpe posts explicit texts from accuser sparking wild reactions from fans","Shannon Sharpe has been going through a tough time ever since he was accused of sexually assaulting a young woman on multiple occasions.

Most apps today have become unusable. They bombard users with irritating notifications, spam messages, and dark patterns, and many are downright scammy.

Without your knowledge, numerous apps on your phone track and harvest extensive data: which apps you've installed, how you use them, the content of your emails and SMS, media on your device, and more.

What's truly disturbing is that some apps track usage not just within their own environment but across other apps too. This means your most personal data is being harvested without your consent and sold to companies for shady targeting purposes.

At @zerodhaonline, we're different. We only request app permissions that are genuinely necessary for functionality. We don't send unnecessary push notifications, messages, or emails. We don't peddle useless financial products or push you to trade for the sake of ""engagement.""

Not doing unto others what we don't want done unto us is deeply rooted in our philosophy.

Taking to microblogging platform X, Kamath wrote “Most apps today have become unusable.

Indian cobra vs Chinese cobra: Who would win



Also Read |

When comparing venomous giants such as the Indian cobra and the Chinese cobra, the differences ignite an interesting debate. Both snakes have powerful neurotoxic venom that can kill, but their physical characteristics and behaviours distinguish them. The Indian cobra, which inhabits the entire Indian subcontinent, is famous for its dramatic hood display and fearless temperament. Conversely, the Chinese cobra, found in Southeast Asia and southern China, is a bit nimbler and shy. Although both are dangerous in their respective habitats, variables like size, ferocity, habitat, and reaction to danger would all be major factors in any theoretical confrontation.Indian cobra's natural habitat is located on the Indian subcontinent with a very wide range of distribution. Indian cobra inhabit nearly every kind of habitat, ranging from dense forest to dry desert stretches of land to even cultivated fields and even dense urban areas. This makes Indian cobra one of India's most commonly encountered venomous snakes, found mostly in rural and suburban landscapes where human and snake interaction becomes a relatively common phenomenon.By contrast, the Chinese cobra is native to East and Southeast Asia, with its primary distribution in southern China, Taiwan, and northern Vietnam. It occurs in a variety of habitats, from lowland plains to hilly country and forests. Like the Indian cobra, the Chinese cobra has demonstrated some capacity to occupy territories in close proximity to human settlement, which increases the chances of encounters in semi-urban areas.Indian cobra is a large snake, ranging from 4 to 7 feet for adults. Some of them reach more, reaching 10 feet on special occasions. Between 1.1 and 2.7 kilograms in weight, the Indian cobra has a solid body that can yield physical advantages when it comes to strength and attack.The Chinese cobra is relatively shorter, thus it tends to be on average 3 to 4 feet long and weighing about 1 to 2 kilograms. Its lighter, rounded body due to its briefness lightens it and perhaps makes it quicker. Even with the lack of the heaviness of its Indian relative, such briefness is feasible with enhanced locomotion and agility in movement or pounce.These cobras are highly venomous, employing neurotoxins to paralyze predators and guard against predators. The venom of these cobras disrupts the flow of nerve impulses, leading to paralysis and fatal breathing failure. Indian cobra venom has predominantly rapid-acting neurotoxins. It is a powerful assault on the nervous system and therefore a lethal snake to animals and humans alike. Its rapid action makes it deadly.The Chinese cobra, however, has a more intricate venom composition. Not only does it consist of neurotoxins, but also cardiotoxins with the capacity to kill the heart functioning as much as the nervous system. Although smaller in length, this two-way venom increases the combat capability of the Chinese cobra, and its bite is more lethal.In an imagined standoff between the two, the Indian cobra would perhaps possess a raw power advantage in terms of reach and bulk. Its wider build means broader displays of the hood and, potentially, a harder hit to deliver, and it can produce a powerful look.The Chinese cobra, however, can turn the tables with speed. Lighter and smaller, it can move and strike faster and perhaps first. With a faster reflex and accuracy, it may be able to land a killing bite before the Indian cobra can respond. Because both snakes possess such lethal venom, the successful strike would most likely be a death blow, either fast or quick.Combat between the Indian cobra and Chinese cobra would be brief and vicious, both having a great deal to lose. The Indian cobra's strength and reach would initially seem to be an asset, but the Chinese cobra's velocity and more sophisticated venom composition offer a lethal counter.It would then be a matter of who would be able to get the first strike in, since both are deadly if they bite you. Oftentimes though, the outcome would be a tie—the two cobras both dead due to each other's venom and proving that nature has a tendency to bring forth the greatest begetting death when faced with an equal killer.","Indian cobra is a large snake, ranging from 4 to 7 feet for adults.

""He has added it to his repertoire,"" a source told Page Six.""It's his communication platform of choice.""He can't give anyone his number to minimize the probability of his number getting leaked.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Elon Musk criticism of OpenAI’s for-profit status

Podcaster Rob Wiblin recently shared a post highlighting a legal letter titled 'Not For Private Gain', signed by 3 Nobel Prize winners and dozens of AI researchers, accusing OpenAI of illegally restructuring from a non-profit to a for-profit entity. Sent to California and Delaware Attorneys General, the letter allegedly demands halting the restructuring of the company. X owner and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk replied to the post, calling it “scam of the century”.The post also has screenshots of the letter with the following text highlighted in colour: All of the governance safeguards that Mr. Altman claimed “ensure (OpenAI) remains focused on its long-term mission would be in jeopardy”. It also has a table comparing the current governance safeguards of OpenAI (under its nonprofit structure) with the proposed changes under the for-profit restructuring.Founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, OpenAI is reportedly looking to turn the status to for-profit. The company, as per reports plans to restructure as a public benefit corporation, a shift that has raised concerns among AI experts, legal scholars and former OpenAI employees. They argue that the move could compromise OpenAI’s original mission to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of all humanity.Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI has been a vocal critic of this transition. He has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI that will go to a jury trial in spring 2026.

Responses will typically be shorter while maintaining the depth and quality you’ve come to expect. Once limits for the original version of deep research are reached, queries automatically default to the lightweight version,” said the company.The lightweight deep research tool is now available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users, with plans to extend access to Enterprise and educational users next week. OpenAI has also made the tool accessible to free-tier users, offering five tasks per month. Paying users benefit from expanded usage limits , with the tool seamlessly switching to the lightweight version once limits for the original deep research are reached.While responses from the lightweight version are shorter, they retain the structured logic and citations that users expect from the original deep research tool. OpenAI claims the lightweight model is cheaper to serve, enabling broader adoption without compromising the user experience.“All Plus, Team, and Pro users now have expanded usage of deep research. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the following week, and will have the same usage levels as Team users. The lightweight version of deep research is starting to rollout today to all Free users,” added the company.","OpenAI has introduced a lightweight version of its ChatGPT deep research tool.

While it does not support third-party music apps yet, Perplexity is reportedly working on integrating support for Gmail and Google Calendar in future updates.

Email and communication

The assistant will also allow users to compose emails, check their inboxes, and send replies, making it a useful tool for managing communications without needing to manually type messages.
