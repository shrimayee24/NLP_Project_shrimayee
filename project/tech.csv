Can the Rodgers-Adams reunion revitalize the Jets' season?



Aaron Rodgers & Davante Adams Talk Reunion After Trade To The Jets | Pat McAfee Show

Could Adams be the answer for Rodgers amid Williams' struggles?



In the wake of a tough Week 6 loss to the Buffalo Bills , New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers finds a silver lining with the return of former teammate Davante Adams . This reunion not only lifts team morale but also raises hopes for a turnaround in the Jets' struggling 2-4 season. The question on everyone's mind: can Adams rekindle the spark that once made them an unstoppable duo?Also Read: “[Jerry Jones] Was Out of Line”: Cowboys owner’s Radio outburst sheds light on NFL Media’s dark side, says Mike Florio After a disappointing loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6, New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has reason to celebrate: his former teammate, Davante Adams, is back in the locker room.Having a close friend by your side can boost morale, but the question remains—can Adams turn around the Jets' 2-4 season?Rodgers described Adams' return as surreal and reflected on his remarkable transformation from “fat to fit” by taking Rodgers' advice seriously. When asked if Adams could enhance the Jets' offense, Rodgers confidently stated, “Yeah, I mean, he can do a lot of different things. He can play all three positions: on the ball, receiver, off the ball, and slot. He’s got a high football IQ. I think he’s going to help.” That's high praise for the star wideout.Rodgers also expressed optimism for the team’s younger players, noting,“I think he can help teach the young guys who are willing and eager to listen coz he’s a master of route running and releases. He’s always working on his craft.” On his on-field chemistry with Adams, he added, “We click. I mean we could literally watch a highlight clip and both of us not only know the game, but the play in the situation and the thoughts that were behind and maybe a conversation that happened. So that’s a gift.” The statistics certainly backup Rodgers’ enthusiasm. (Via: EssentiallySports)The Green Bay Packers locker room was a powerhouse for Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams. Together, they lit up the field, with Adams racking up 622 catches, 7,590 yards, and 69 touchdowns in 108 games. Rodgers thrived alongside him, boasting a passer rating of 103.5, 28,368 yards, and 237 touchdowns. Yet, before reuniting with his old teammate, Rodgers criticized Mike Williams for the loss to the Bills.The Jets endured a disappointing Week 6, falling to the Buffalo Bills 20-23. Their performance was marred by red zone struggles, missed kicks, and penalties, but Aaron Rodgers notably highlighted a key mistake by wide receiver Mike Williams. “It’s two vertical [routes]. Allen [Lazard] is down the seam and Mike is down the red line. I’m looking at Allen, he puts his hand up and three guys go with him. So I’m throwing a no-look to the red line. And when I peek my eyes back there, [Williams] is running an in-breaker. He’s got to be on the red line. It’s the little things every single time.” he stated.This miscommunication proved costly, especially when the Jets needed a conversion on third-and-16, leading to an interception by Taron Johnson. Williams’ struggles extend beyond this moment; he has yet to score a touchdown this season, accumulating just 145 yards and 10 receptions with a longest catch of 22 yards.In contrast, Davante Adams of the Las Vegas Raiders is in excellent form, with 18 catches, 209 yards, and a touchdown over three games. The seasoned receiver boasts impressive career stats, including 10,990 yards and 96 touchdowns across 153 games.The Jets will look to turn their fortunes around against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday, October 21, at Acrisure Stadium, as fans eagerly await the potential Rodgers-Adams connection to spark a turnaround.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes delivers strong message to Travis Kelce and team following Chiefs' shocking offensive stats","New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has reason to celebrate: his former teammate, Davante Adams, is back in the locker room.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs talked about AI 40 years ago: Here’s a video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-co-founder-steve-jobs-talked-about-ai-40-years-ago-heres-a-video/articleshow/114403621.cms,"This is what is he talks about AI

And so we’re finding the way we’ve built computers in the past isn’t working for the kinds of things we want to do in the future. And we’re examining new architectures, these fancy words like non–von Neumann machines, etcetera. And what we’re doing is we’re starting to look to the human brain. How is the human brain architected? And we’re finding that computers are very good at doing very simple things extremely accurately. And the human mind is very good at doing very complex things adequately. And there’s a ton of people now starting to look to the brain as a model of an architecture to build a computer.

The main differentiation that exists now between the two machines, and I’m going to use the word “machine” to describe the brain for a moment, is that man is self-conscious, obviously. We are conscious that we’re conscious: “I am thinking.” And to our knowledge, no computer or any even of the high primates has yet to say, “I am thinking.”

And so a tremendous amount of work is going on in the artificial intelligence community to try to understand what self-consciousness is, to try to understand if a computer can ever be self-conscious. But I think the biggest thing that motivates a lot of us is, unlike what we just heard, we don’t know. We honestly don’t know whether we are more than just a machine.

And we are building better and better computers. We’re running up against roadblocks. A lot of people are spending the best parts of their lives right now to try to understand the architecture of the brain and how we can make better and better machines to emulate it. And I actually think, by the end of our lifetimes, we’re going to know the answer to this question. And that’s what’s driving a lot of us.

While artificial intelligence as a technology may have picked up steam after the launch of ChatGPT two years ago, the concept is far from new. Apple founder Steve Jobs , a visionary in the tech world, predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago, envisioning machines that may answer questions and think like humans.On the Steve Jobs Archive , there’s footage from 1983 in which Jobs is talking to people at the International Design Conference in Aspen.The old video shows what Jobs thought about computers at that time, how books may be replaced by computers one day and the amount of work that is being done to understand the architecture of the brain to help machines emulate it.You can watch the video and a bunch of others using this link",Apple founder Steve Jobs predicted the potential of AI as far back as 40 years ago.

The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5. Choose whether you want to link the device with your account. Select 'Yes' or 'No' based on your preference.6. Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

During a dig in 1936, paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Prince found a theropod (a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur) specimen at the Santa Maria Formation in southern Brazil. Thanks to radiocarbon dating of sediments surrounding the fossil, during the late Triassic period, about 225 million years ago. Also called the “Southern Cross Lizard,” the dinosaur was named after the Southern Hemisphere constellation.

From the findings we have, the Staurikosaurus was large for an early dinosaur — it was around 2 meters long, 80 cm tall, and weighed 30 kg, which is close to the weight of a large dog. Staurikosaurus had a long tail and ran on two legs, and its fossils suggest that it was quite fast for its size. The predator also had serrated teeth that were curved towards the back of its throat, which helped with catching and holding prey.","The Staurikosaurus was a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur.

Other AI tools that Meta is releasing

Meta , the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, recently announced that it is releasing new AI models, including a “Self-Taught Evaluator”, from its research division. Among other things, this AI model uses AI to evaluate other AI models, potentially reducing the need for human involvement in the development process.Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator is nothing but a “chain of thought” reasoning technique, which is used by OpenAI's latest model OpenAI o1 that is claimed to offer reasoning while responding.As per a report by news agency Reuters, this approach breaks down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, improving accuracy in areas like mathematics, scientific analysis, and coding.What sets Meta's model apart is that it's trained entirely on AI-generated data, eliminating the reliance on human-labeled data.Notably, this approach of AI model may pave the way for more autonomous AI systems capable of self-improvement. By learning from its own mistakes, AI could become increasingly accurate and sophisticated without constant human intervention.“We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human,” said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.This may also streamline the development process and potentially lead to more powerful and efficient AI applications.“The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI,” he added.In addition to the Self-Taught Evaluator, Meta also released other AI tools, including an update to its Segment Anything image identification model, a tool to accelerate response times in large language models, and datasets to aid in the discovery of new inorganic materials.","Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator is nothing but a “chain of thought” reasoning technique.

Google still has to bring this one ‘change’ despite getting pause order on Play store ruling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-still-has-to-bring-this-one-change-despite-getting-pause-order-on-play-store-ruling/articleshow/114371024.cms,"For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement with an OEM or carrier not to preinstall an Android app distribution platform or store other than the Google Play Store.

Why Google is being penalised

A federal judge has granted Google a relief in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games , temporarily halting a ruling that would have forced significant changes to the Google Play Store . However, Google is still required to comply with one aspect of the original order, according to a report.As per The Verge, starting November 1, the injunction on payment and revenue share is not stayed.The injunction reads:US District Judge James Donato granted Google's request to pause his October 7 injunction. The pause will remain in effect until the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals rules on Google's separate request for a longer stay during its appeal of the case.“We're pleased with the District Court's decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,” a Google spokesperson said.Epic Games, maker of the popular game “Fortnite,” challenged Google's control over the Android app market. A December 2023 ruling that found Google guilty of illegally monopolising theAndroid app market could have significant financial implications for the tech giant.The initial injunction permitted alternative payment systems within apps, and stopped paying device makers to pre-install the Google Play Store. These changes could disrupt the Play Store's estimated $14.66 billion in annual revenue.Google argued that implementing these changes so quickly would introduce ""serious safety, security and privacy risks"" to Android users.","A federal judge has granted Google a relief in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games.

Early Success

Pro Model Surge

Challenges Ahead

Long-Term Outlook

Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16 , has good news for Apple in China . Bloomberg reports strong sales for Apple's newest iPhone in China, quoting research firm Counterpoint. Compared to the 2023 model, sales are up 20% in the first three weeks, according to Counterpoint Research data. This is a positive sign for Apple, after facing challenges in the crucial Chinese market last year.Though the smartphone market is stagnant, the iPhone remains Apple's most crucial product, generating roughly half of its sales.Strong iPhone sales in China are a positive indicator for Apple's overall performance.The iPhone 16's success can be attributed to several factors. A smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and existing user upgrades all contributed to ""substantial growth"" in China, said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam.Consumers are also gravitating towards pricier options, with sales of the top-tier Pro and Pro Max models jumping 44% compared to their predecessors.Despite the promising start, competition remains fierce. Local rivals like Vivo's X200 Pro, Huawei's upcoming Mate device, and updates from Xiaomi and Oppo threaten to steal market share. Additionally, the ongoing economic slowdown in China might lead some consumers to delay purchases until major shopping holidays like Singles' Day in November.While the iPhone 16 boasts AI features, the lack of a local partner for these features in China poses a potential hurdle. Analysts previously expressed concerns about this, as Beijing restricts foreign-developed AI models. Apple may need to collaborate with a Chinese company like Baidu to fully utilize these features in the region.While the initial response is positive, it remains to be seen how the iPhone 16 will fare throughout its lifespan. The success will depend on navigating intense competition and the ongoing economic climate in China.","Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16, has good news for Apple in China.
