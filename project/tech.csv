Why DeepSeek and its model made waves in US tech industry



iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Series Mega Unboxing





Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals. After launch, the DeepSeek R1 model stood out for its cost-efficient development and its open-source nature, offering unlimited free usage to a wide audience. Its emergence as a direct competitor to models from industry leaders such as OpenAI Google , and Anthropic has brought new scrutiny to the financial investments required for AI development.According to a report by Reuters, DeepSeek revealed that the company spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train its R1 model. This figure was published in a peer-reviewed article in the academic journal Nature.The company’s disclosure may reignite a debate in the tech industry over why US giants are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train large language models (LLMs).DeepSeek's release of what it claimed were lower-cost AI systems in January caused investors to sell off tech stocks, as they worried the new models could threaten the dominance of companies like Nvidia. The update, which is the first cost estimate the Hangzhou-based company has released for its R1 model, appeared in a paper co-authored by its founder, Liang Wenfeng.The paper specified that the reasoning-focused model was trained using 512 Nvidia H800 chips.By comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2023 that ""foundational model training"" had cost ""much more"" than $100 million, though his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported.Some of DeepSeek's previous claims about its development costs and technology have been questioned by US companies and officials. The company’s use of H800 chips comes after the US in October 2022 made it illegal for Nvidia to export its more powerful H100 and A100 AI chips to China.In a supplementary document to the Nature article, DeepSeek acknowledged for the first time that it does own A100 chips and used them in the “preparatory stages of development” for R1.US officials claimed in June that DeepSeek had access to “large volumes” of H100 chips procured after export controls were in place, a claim Nvidia has denied, stating that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 chips.","Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals.

Meta introduces Celeste: Subtle AR display, wristband control, and luxury design hints



Meta’s Celeste AR glasses: Premium cost, niche audience, strategic launch



Meta faces child safety controversies while pushing forward with AR and AI



Meta aims to grow AR market by empowering developers with Celeste

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and niche markets, rather than appealing to a broad mainstream consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky, heavier than expected, and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers, encouraging innovative apps, and paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet officially confirmed the exact status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will likely follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that reflects the UAE’s values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways. This year’s celebrations are also expected to set new records in tourism and retail spending, reflecting the growing impact of National Day on the UAE’s economy.","The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2.

Dubai Fountain reopening set for early October

What’s new at the Dubai Fountain





Here’s what’s changed:





A brand-new flooring system now replaces the old foundation, which was known to crack over time. The new base is made of shiny, reinforced concrete designed to better insulate and retain water, solving a recurring maintenance issue.





Beneath that floor lies a carefully engineered waterproofing layer and an insulation system, topped with glowing blue tiles. These tiles aren’t just for looks, they reflect beautifully through the water and are visible from any vantage point around the lake.





The fountain’s choreography now relies on a new generation of robotic systems, each designed for precision:



Choreography bots guide the movement of the water itself

Lighting bots match visual effects to musical cues

Fixed water jets, dozens of them, are reprogrammed to spray in perfect rhythm with each show’s score







The scale and legacy of the Dubai Fountain





Its jets can launch water up to 150 metres high



It features 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors



Performances are choreographed to a diverse mix of classical, Arabic, and contemporary music





What to expect from the upgraded Dubai Fountain experience









After five months of silence, drained waters, and behind-the-scenes upgrades, the Dubai Fountain, the towering spectacle at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, is ready for its return. Emaar has officially announced that the world-famous attraction will be fully operational by October 1, 2025, marking the end of a massive redevelopment that touches nearly every element of the fountain’s structure and show. From state-of-the-art robotics to a brand-new underwater floor, this isn’t just maintenance, it’s a full-scale reinvention of one of Dubai’s most iconic landmarks.Dubai’s most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive upgrade that saw the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake drained, exposing the massive infrastructure beneath the surface. Now, with the waters refilled and the giant digital display screens removed, the space is beginning to take its familiar shape once again. In a recent Instagram post, Emaar stated that the Dubai Fountain is expected to be fully operational by Wednesday, October 1, although the developer noted that the attraction will not resume performances until “early October.”The developer first broke the news via Instagram, noting that while work is nearly complete, operations will resume only once the team is confident that all systems, both technical and visual, are ready for a seamless experience. So while the date is marked, there’s still a margin for final tweaks before the relaunch.This was never just a cosmetic refresh. Emaar’s redevelopment focused on the structural foundation and performance technology — rethinking the fountain from the inside out.Every movement, every beam of light, every rise and fall of the fountain is programmed, and just a single song in the show takes several weeks of fine-tuning to execute correctly. The accompanying playlist, featuring over 48 carefully selected tracks, blends classical, pop, and traditional Arabic music to reflect Dubai’s cosmopolitan spirit and cultural heritage, enhancing the fountain’s grandeur and global appeal.The result is a completely rebuilt platform that still looks like the Dubai Fountain, but performs with a new level of power, elegance, and reliability.To appreciate the effort behind this upgrade, it’s worth revisiting what the Dubai Fountain actually is, not just in reputation, but in scale.Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, the Dubai Fountain made its official debut on May 8, 2009, alongside the opening of The Dubai Mall. Spanning 275 metres across the manmade Burj Khalifa Lake, it is the largest choreographed fountain in the world.With each show, the fountain has drawn millions of visitors, becoming a staple of Downtown Dubai and one of the most recognisable water performances on the planet.And despite the closure over the past few months, Emaar ensured that the space didn’t go quiet. During redevelopment, the site was fenced off, but not hidden. The barriers were embedded with digital screens, looping archival footage of previous shows in sync with the Burj Khalifa light display, allowing visitors to still engage with the spirit of the fountain even while it was offline.Once the Dubai Fountain resumes operations in October, visitors can expect a performance that feels both familiar and entirely refreshed.The sound and light systems have been enhanced, the choreography is sharper, and the integration of robotics promises smoother, more spectacular motion than ever before. The changes aren’t just technical, they’re immersive. These upgrades were built with both performance and maintenance in mind, ensuring the fountain can continue to run spectacular shows with fewer interruptions and less wear over time.And while the core elements, the music, the light, the water, will remain central to the experience, the visual clarity, dynamic precision, and overall grandeur of the show will reflect five months of engineering and design at the highest level.","Dubai's most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive upgrade that saw the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake drained.

Google Pay in Saudi Arabia





What Google Pay offers: Core features

Card Support Across Networks: Users can add and manage Mada debit cards as well as digital credit and prepaid cards from Visa and Mastercard.



Contactless Payments (Tap to Pay): Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals.



(Tap to Pay): Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals. In-App and Online Transactions: Soon, the service will also enable purchases within apps and on websites.



Google Wallet Integration: The Google Wallet app, which powers the Google Pay experience, also allows users to store loyalty cards, event tickets, boarding passes, and other digital items in one centralized location for easy access.



Security Architecture: A key strength of the platform is its multi-layered security. Instead of transmitting real card data during transactions, it uses tokenization, creating a device-specific virtual card number with a dynamic security code that refreshes with every payment. This ensures that actual card details remain protected throughout the transaction process.



Ease of Use: Activation is streamlined. Users only need to download the Google Wallet or Google Pay app, sign in with their Google account, add a bank card, and complete a quick security verification. Once set up, the phone is ready for tap-to-pay functionality.





Limitations and drawbacks: What users should consider

Restricted Bank Support at Launch: Only Riyad Bank and Al Rajhi Bank cards are supported at present. Cards issued by other banks may not yet be functional with Google Pay, though wider support is planned in upcoming phases.



Android-Only Compatibility: The service is not available to iPhone users, which confines access to users of Android smartphones or Wear OS smartwatches.



Point-of-Sale Gaps: While major retailers and e-commerce platforms already accept Google Pay, some smaller vendors may lack the necessary infrastructure or awareness to support it. This is expected to improve over time but may be an obstacle during the early adoption phase.



Dependence on Internet Connectivity: A stable internet connection is essential for initiating and verifying some transactions, especially during card addition or initial setups. In areas with poor network access, users may face interruptions or failed transactions.

How to get started: Step-by-step activation

Download the Google Wallet (or Google Pay) app from the Google Play Store.

Sign in using the Google account associated with the device.

Tap “Add Card” in the app interface.

Scan or manually enter your card details.

Complete the security verification process via your bank’s authentication method.

Once verified, your device is ready for contactless transactions.

Market impact: Google Pay enters a crowded field





Google Pay is now officially available to Android users in Saudi Arabia, marking a significant step in the Kingdom’s digital transformation efforts. Launched on September 15, 2025, in collaboration with the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), the service brings contactless, secure payments through Android devices, with full integration into the national payment infrastructure, Mada. Here’s a detailed look at how it works, who can use it, what it offers, and what it doesn’t.The formal rollout of Google Pay in Saudi Arabia was announced during the Money20/20 Middle East event, held at the Riyadh International Convention and Exhibition Center in Mulham. This initiative, developed jointly by Google and SAMA, represents a major addition to the local digital payments ecosystem.The service operates through Mada, the national payment network, and is part of the broader push under Vision 2030 to reduce reliance on cash and enhance the Kingdom’s financial infrastructure. It also aligns with the Financial Sector Development Program, which encourages adoption of modern financial technologies and a shift toward a cashless society.Currently, Al Rajhi Bank and Riyad Bank support the service, with additional banks set to join in phases. Other institutions with cards potentially compatible in future updates include the National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi French Bank, Alinma Bank, and others.Also read: Saudi Arabia’s central bank launches Google Pay and announces Alipay+ acceptance by 2026 Google Pay, as rolled out in Saudi Arabia, functions as a digital wallet for Android phones and Wear OS smartwatches, offering users a quick and secure way to manage transactions and digital essentials.Here’s what the service includes:While Google Pay brings new capabilities to Android users in Saudi Arabia, its initial launch comes with a few limitations that users should be aware of.For those ready to use Google Pay, the process is designed to be intuitive and fast:With its official entry into the Saudi market, Google Pay joins a competitive lineup of existing digital wallet solutions that include Apple Pay, STC Pay, Mada Pay, and Hala. Each of these services brings its own features and integrations, but Google Pay’s tight integration with Android systems and its global brand familiarity could offer it a distinct edge.Its introduction is expected to drive further adoption of digital wallets, especially across retail outlets, restaurants, transportation services, and e-commerce platforms, contributing to a more digitized and efficient consumer economy.",Google Pay is now officially available to Android users in Saudi Arabia. Users can add and manage Mada debit cards as well as digital credit and prepaid cards from Visa and Mastercard. Payments can be made via NFC (Near Field Communication) by tapping a phone or smartwatch at supported point-of-sale terminals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123945494,imgsize-300510,width-400,resizemode-4/google-pay-saudi-arabia.jpg"

UPI's global expansion strategy: A vision for the future









The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has rapidly gained global attention for revolutionizing digital payments in India, and its expansion is now making waves in the Middle East, especially across the GCC nations. UPI, which allows for instant and secure transactions across multiple bank accounts, has been rolled out in countries like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, providing both Indian nationals and tourists with a seamless payment experience.UPI, a system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has become one of the most successful fintech innovations, boasting over ₹20 trillion in transactions by September 2024. Initially launched in India in 2016, UPI has enabled users to send and receive money in real time without sharing sensitive bank account details. As part of its ambitious internationalization strategy, NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL) has been driving UPI's expansion globally, with the goal of making the payment system available in 20 countries by FY29.So far, UPI has been rolled out in 12 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, France, and others.In the GCC, UPI is currently available in four countries: the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. As more banks provide support, additional countries are expected to join the UPI network soon.Since 2022, UPI has expanded beyond India, initially reaching select Middle Eastern countries. With recent launches in Qatar and Oman, the GCC region is now a key player in UPI’s international growth, offering significant benefits to millions of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Indian tourists.The UAE became the first country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to roll out UPI payments. In 2022, UPI became available via the NeoPay app, enabling Indian expats to link their international mobile numbers and perform transactions without the need for an Indian SIM card. Recently, in 2025, an important update was made, allowing Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in the UAE to access UPI without the necessity of having an Indian mobile number. This milestone significantly improved the digital payment experience for the Indian diaspora and tourists in the UAE, offering familiar and convenient payment methods.Notably, UPI payments are accepted across retail outlets, supermarkets, transportation services, and tourist spots like Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates. Indian tourists—who make up a significant portion of the UAE's visitors—are expected to reach 5.29 million in 2024 alone. For them, UPI brings an instant and secure payment solution without the need for cash or international cards, streamlining cross-border transactions.In 2023, Oman became the seventh country to embrace UPI and RuPay, following Singapore, Nepal, the UAE, Bhutan, Malaysia, and France. The launch in Oman was marked by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between NPCI, NIPL, and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) on October 4, 2022. This collaboration allows for real-time cross-border payments and the use of RuPay cards across Oman's ATM networks, POS terminals, and e-commerce platforms.With a significant number of Indian nationals living and working in Oman, UPI's introduction offers an efficient, cost-effective way for remittances to flow between India and Oman, a crucial feature for Indian expatriates.Qatar started integrating UPI payments in 2023, making it easier for Indian tourists and residents to pay at retail outlets, tourist spots, and other businesses using popular UPI apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm . Then, in July 2024, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) teamed up with Qatar National Bank (QNB), a major milestone in expanding UPI acceptance across QNB’s merchant network. This partnership ensures that Indian visitors to Qatar now have a seamless and familiar payment experience.Qatar’s tourism industry, which sees a lot of Indian visitors, is about to get even more convenient with UPI payments. On September 16, 2025, Commercial Bank of Qatar teamed up with NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) to bring UPI QR code payments to its merchants. This makes paying easier for Indian tourists and strengthens Qatar’s push for a cashless economy.Saudi Arabia has been another important addition to the UPI network, with NRIs in the kingdom already able to link Saudi (+966) mobile numbers to their Indian bank accounts. This system facilitates cross-border remittances and everyday transactions through the UPI platform. Additionally, Indian expats living in Saudi Arabia can link their international mobile numbers to their NRE/NRO accounts, making it easier for them to use UPI apps such as PhonePe and Google Pay.One of the most appealing aspects of UPI for NRIs in the GCC is that it enables them to make transactions without needing an Indian mobile number. By linking an international mobile number to their NRE or NRO account, users can transfer funds to and from their Indian bank accounts through a variety of UPI-enabled apps, including PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and BHIM.Here’s how you can set up UPI with an international mobile number:AU Small Finance Bank, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, City Union Bank, DBS Bank Ltd, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank.NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), is driving the global expansion of UPI and RuPay. As of September 2025, UPI is live in 12 countries, including major trading partners like Singapore, Australia, the USA, and the UK. NIPL’s partnerships with institutions like QNB and Network International in the Middle East are pushing UPI deeper into global payment systems.With a focus on cross-border remittances and smoother experiences for international travelers, UPI is quickly becoming a key player in global fintech. These collaborations are helping promote India’s digital payments while supporting the growth of real-time payment systems worldwide.","Since 2022, UPI has expanded beyond India, initially reaching select Middle Eastern countries.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Video: Jasmine Crockett says ‘crime doesn’t make you a criminal’; social media isn’t convinced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/video-jasmine-crockett-says-crime-doesnt-make-you-a-criminal-social-media-isnt-convinced/articleshow/123992958.cms,"



A new video of Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett has gone viral after she said: “Just because someone has committed a crime, it doesn’t make them a criminal.” The Texas lawmaker’s comments sparked a torrent of online ridicule.“I understood what was kind of pushing them there. And so I do want people to know that just because someone has committed a crime, it doesn’t make them a criminal,” Crockett said. “Being a criminal is more so about your mindset. Committing a crime can come for a lot of different reasons.”The remarks quickly drew scorn on X, formerly Twitter. “Pretty sure it does,” wrote AmericanPapaBear, while user @TheRightGirl47 argued, “The LITERAL definition of criminal is a person who has committed a crime. That is exactly what it makes you.” Conservative commentator Buzz Patterson accused her of having “overplayed her racist hand,” while others mocked her legal background. “The Bar exam must have been easy for Jasmine,” one post read. Another bluntly added: “Actually, doing a crime does make you a criminal.”Responses ranged from incredulity to open derision. “She can’t define criminal. Yikes!” wrote one critic, while another quipped, “Being elected to Congress doesn’t make you a congressman, either.”Several accused Crockett of “always trying to change the definition of words,” while one post called her remarks “such wonderful clarity… exactly what you would expect from a clown.”The controversy comes as the nation is still reeling from the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month. Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of shooting Kirk at Utah Valley University, was charged with capital murder this week, with prosecutors announcing they would seek the death penalty.This is not the first time Crockett has triggered uproar over her views on law enforcement. Just last week, a clip of her on the Grounded podcast went viral after she claimed that “law enforcement isn’t to prevent crime. Law enforcement solves crime.” Her comments were swiftly denounced by police officers, commentators, and even former intelligence officials, with one branding her remarks “terrifying.”","Jasmine Crockett said: ""Just because someone has committed a crime, it doesn’t make them a criminal"" Her comments sparked a torrent of online ridicule, with many accusing her of trying to change the definition of words.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Samsung may bring first tri-fold phone to US this year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-may-bring-first-tri-fold-phone-to-us-this-year-report/articleshow/124002405.cms,"Representative image

“A much larger screen than before”

Betting on foldables





Samsung is considering releasing its upcoming “tri-fold” smartphone in the United States later this year, marking the first time such a device would be available in the market, according to a CNN Business report. Samsung is still weighing which markets to launch the device in, but the US is part of those discussions, a person familiar with the company’s plans told the publication. Notably, Samsung has often limited new product lines to certain regions, such as South Korea and China. For instance, last year it released the Galaxy Z Fold 6 SE only in those countries.Chinese rival Huawei already sells a tri-folding phone, but the company does not operate in the US market. If Samsung proceeds, it would make the device the first tri-fold smartphone available to American consumers.The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables. “I think what we’re seeing is a bit more of a return to life before (the smartphone),” said Drew Blackard, senior vice president of mobile product management for Samsung Electronics America, in an interview with CNN.“When older cell phones had different forms and people wanted a variety of options.”Minseok Kang, Samsung’s global head of smartphone product planning, told the publication that the 2025 launch timeline is on track. Kang described the new form factor as the next step in a product strategy that has already seen strong demand for the Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold, which together saw a 25% increase in preorders compared to their predecessors. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung’s latest foldable, unfolds to an eight-inch screen.Samsung has teased tri-folding prototypes at trade shows, including the Flex G and Flex S concepts. The upcoming phone would mark the first time those designs are translated into a commercial product.“I think… the exciting part is getting it out into the wild and then ultimately seeing what different users are attracted to,” Blackard told CNN.Analysts say the tri-fold could remain a niche, high-priced device like Samsung’s existing Fold lineup. But it could help the company stand apart from rivals, especially as Apple prepares to launch its iPhone Air this week and reportedly develops its own foldable phone for 2026.","The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
