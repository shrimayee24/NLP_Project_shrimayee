Saudi Arabia's dedication to facilitating worship at all hours is evident in its expansion of 24-hour mosque access beyond just Masjid Al-Qiblatain. Here's a look at other mosques in the Kingdom that offer round-the-clock facilities for worshippers:

"Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu: Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to….",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-whether-it-is-google-or-apple-when-they-operate-in-india-they-have-to-/articleshow/124376512.cms,"Sridhar Vembu ’s three faces of privacy

Poll Is it reasonable for companies to comply with the laws of the countries they operate in, even on privacy issues? Yes, it's necessary No, companies should have their own standards

What Zoho’s Sridhar Vembu wrote in X post

On the topic of privacy, there are three distinct cases I want to address:

1. The secret lover case

2. The violation we feel when a company uses our personal data to show ads to us

3. The secret rebel case

The secret lover case also applies to org trade secrets and confidential data but ""secret lover"" is more catchy 😁

We work hard to ensure your privacy in case 1. Our tech stack and product are designed with this as a major goal.

Let me come to case 2. By taking a vow to not use your data to try to sell you stuff, we protect you from that sense of distaste or violation. Our strong stand also ensures that corporate confidential data or trade secrets do not get leaked to those ad-related data mining systems.

The secret rebel case is subject to the laws of the nations we operate in. Any company operating in a jurisdiction promising to protect a secret rebel against their own government is making a false promise. Sovereign power always prevails over mere companies. Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America.

So while secret rebels can communicate like secret lovers do, secret rebels cannot expect courts to affirm their right to plot against their government.

Our stand has been consistent on this matter. I have said these in our Zoholics events in many locations around the world for well over a decade.





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company’s approach to users’ privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X (formerly Twitter) recently. In the post, he described three privacy cases – secret lover, use of personal data to show ads and secret rebel. He also emphasized that all companies must follow the laws of the country in which they operate. “Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America,” Vembu writes in the post. His remarks comes as the company's messaging platform Arattai gains popularity, topping both Apple App Store and Google Play Store.The first, which he called the “secret lover case,” refers to personal data, corporate trade secrets, and confidential information. He said Zoho designs its technology and products to protect such data and maintain strict privacy.The second, he said, involves the use of personal data for targeted advertising. Zoho has pledged not to use customer data to sell products or services, a practice Vembu said prevents a sense of violation and protects corporate confidential information from ad-related data-mining systems.The third, the “secret rebel case,” refers to situations where individuals may seek to challenge their governments.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company’s approach to users’ privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X.

Elon Musk’s xAI studio aims to create innovative AI-generated video games



Experts warn AI content creation cannot match human creativity and vision



Musk’s Grok aims for AI movies while raising copyright and ethical concerns

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation.

Final notes for viewers across the UAE





Best Time to View: Just after sunset on October 7, with the moon rising above the horizon.

Photography Tip: Use a tripod and shoot just after moonrise for the best balance of size, light, and contrast against landscapes.





On the night of October 7, 2025, the UAE will witness a rare and brilliant celestial display — the Hunter Supermoon. Appearing 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual, this astronomical event offers a unique stargazing opportunity. Whether you're heading to the desert, mountains, or a beach, the UAE has a wide range of prime viewing locations, from expert-led events to serene natural spots — all promising a clear, awe-inspiring sight of the moon in its closest orbit to Earth.The Hunter Supermoon, also known as the Hunter’s Moon, traditionally signals the time of year when hunters prepared for winter by gathering game under the bright moonlight. Though its name has historical roots, the modern spectacle lies in its astronomical significance.This year’s Hunter Moon becomes a supermoon — a term used when a full moon occurs at perigee, its closest point to Earth in orbit. As a result, on October 7, the moon will appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than when it's at its farthest point. This visual amplification makes it particularly stunning for viewers across the UAE and beyond.This supermoon is the first of three expected in the current season, making it a key date on the calendar for skywatchers.For those seeking a more immersive experience, the Dubai Astronomy Group is organising a public moon-viewing session on Tuesday, October 7, at Al Awir Second Park from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm. The event will include expert explanations and access to telescopes for enhanced viewing.Those unable to attend the official viewing still have plenty of accessible public spots across the UAE to enjoy the event.Located away from urban light pollution, this 24-hour desert location is ideal for moongazing. A 4×4 vehicle is recommended, and designated barbecue areas offer a chance to combine stargazing with a meal. For those wanting fast food, Last Exit Al Qudra is just a 9-minute drive away.Just under two hours from Dubai, Hatta offers scenic mountain views and opportunities for overnight camping. Light pollution exists closer to the town, but deeper into the Hajar Mountains, the skies are clearer for a better viewing experience.Open 24 hours, this coastal location provides a quiet, open space for moon-watching. Visitors can either picnic on the beach or watch from parked cars with air conditioning.This 70-metre-long pedestrian bridge offers panoramic views of the Burj Khalifa, Downtown Dubai, and the creek — creating a striking urban contrast to the natural wonder above. While picnicking isn’t allowed on the bridge itself, nearby benches and restaurants offer comfort and refreshments. Open 24 hours.Al Quaa Milky Way Spot (Abu Dhabi)Approximately 90 minutes from Abu Dhabi towards Al Ain, this is one of the darkest and clearest locations for sky observation. Ideal for more serious stargazers, it requires a 4×4 vehicle and some experience with desert driving.Sharjah Centre for Astronomy and Space SciencesLocated in Sharjah, this facility blends astronomy education with observation. While it has a dedicated observatory and is suitable for public events, availability depends on their schedule, so prior checking is recommended.Jebel Jais, Ras Al KhaimahAs the highest peak in the UAE, Jebel Jais offers an unobstructed and pollution-free sky, perfect for viewing celestial events like the Supermoon. It's an ideal location for those willing to make the drive and prefer solitude with stunning altitude views.","On October 7, 2025, the UAE will witness a rare and brilliant celestial display — the Hunter Supermoon.

If you’re in Dubai this October, get ready to catch one of the city’s biggest Diwali celebrations yet. Fireworks will be lighting up the skies at key spots, alongside a range of cultural events. It’s a perfect chance to experience how Dubai blends tradition and celebration for the Festival of Lights.Running from October 17 to 25, Dubai’s expanded Diwali fireworks celebrations will light up iconic locations like Al Seef and Global Village. With multiple dazzling displays scheduled throughout this period, here’s everything you need to know, where to watch, when to catch the shows, and what makes each fireworks event special.Diwali in Dubai wouldn’t be complete without a burst of colour lighting up the night sky. This year’s fireworks schedule includes five major shows across two venues.The festivities kick off on October 17 with a stunning opening display at Al Seef. Located along the banks of Dubai Creek, this historic waterfront destination offers a unique Diwali experience, pairing views of traditional wooden dhows and restored souks with modern cafés and boutiques.Organisers recommend arriving early — the show is free to attend, but expect large crowds drawn to the charming, old-world setting.The celebration continues at Global Village, which hosts four additional shows over two weekends. Each display begins at 9:00 PM, adding sparkle to the venue’s festive ambience as families and tourists pour in for the Diwali weekend.From October 17 to 19, Al Seef also hosts the ‘Noor: Festival of Lights’, a cultural showcase organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in collaboration with the Indian Consulate in Dubai and Teamwork Arts.Far more than just a fireworks event, Noor transforms Al Seef into a cultural crossroads, celebrating India's rich artistic heritage through:The festival begins at 6:00 PM on October 17, inviting families, residents, and tourists to dive into a multisensory journey of India’s performing arts.

Jewellery sales surge, especially gold, with Indian and UAE-based retailers offering deals and discounts.

UAE announces new Eid Al Etihad brand rules from Abu Dhabi



54th Eid Al Etihad brand rules: dos and don’ts

Logo forms: There are three official logo versions: primary (no frame), a framed version, and a negative (light on dark) version. Use the one that fits your background.

Colours & emblems: The system uses three palettes — Flag Palette (UAE flag colors), Heritage Palette (neutral cultural tones) and a Seven Emirates Palette (each emirate has a defining color and keyword). Seven emblems (palm, dhow, sun, traditional dances, fort, pearl oysters) represent emirates’ identities.

Typefaces: Use the prescribed fonts — Vinyl for English and Athelas Arabic Variable for Arabic to keep text readable and authentic.

Practical do’s: Download the correct logo file, respect minimum size rules (so the logo stays legible), place on uncluttered, high-contrast backgrounds, and follow spacing rules.

Practical don’ts: Don’t stretch, rotate, recolor, add drop-shadows or combine the logo with other logos unless an approved co-branding layout is provided. Don’t use the logo as a random pattern or translate the logotype into other languages.

What residents and businesses need to know

Residents / families: Want to decorate your home or block? Download the right logo and palette, print flags on plain backgrounds, and avoid altering the symbol. For event invites, use the official recommendations where possible.

Small businesses: If you plan to decorate a shopfront, banner or package with Eid Al Etihad identity, follow the spacing/minimum-size rules. If you need co-branding (your logo + Eid logo), check the guideline examples or seek approval through official channels.

Designers & makers (open call): The Eid Al Etihad Team opened a call for creatives to design official merchandise. Application window: Sept 17 – Oct 17, 2025. Winners’ designs may be used in the official collection. Apply through the EidAlEtihad website or official social links.

This year marks the 54th anniversary, a milestone reflecting over half a century of national growth, unity, and shared achievements.The day is a reminder of the UAE’s journey from a group of small, separate sheikhdoms into a modern, unified nation with strong economic, cultural, and social foundations.

Cheap flights Wizz Air Abu Dhabi → Larnaca: Dates, price & how often

WIZZ Plus (from around AED 400+): adds flexible rebooking, larger luggage, and refund options.

Larnaca on a shoestring, what to see and where to save

Smart booking guide for middle-class travelers — How to fly cheaper and smarter

Book Early, Not Last-Minute: Wizz Air uses a dynamic pricing model the earlier you book, the cheaper it gets. Aim to book at least 6–8 weeks before travel. Prices jump closer to holidays, especially Christmas, New Year, and school breaks.

Travel Light — One Small Bag Can Save You Hundreds: Wizz Air’s Basic fare only includes a small carry-on bag (fits under the seat). If you can pack light think roll-up clothes, travel-size toiletries, and digital boarding passes you can skip baggage fees entirely. For longer trips, one 20 kg checked bag shared by two people can be cheaper than paying for two separate ones.

Join WIZZ discount club (Optional but worth it for families): Frequent travelers or families can join WIZZ Discount Club for around €35 (AED 135) per year. It gives €10–20 (AED 40–80) off most fares and extra discounts on baggage often paying for itself in one round trip for two people.

Avoid paying extra at the Airport: Print your boarding pass or have it ready on the Wizz app airport printing fees can be steep. Also, always pre-book luggage and seats online. Adding them at the counter can cost 50–70% more.

Compare total cost, not just the ticket: A €25 fare looks great but remember to factor in:

Seat selection (optional: €5–10) Cabin baggage (optional: €20–30 if upgraded)

Airport meals and transfers: Even then, Wizz Air’s total cost is usually less than half of full-service airlines on similar routes.

Use Budget-Friendly Payment & Travel Tools: Book directly on wizzair.com or the Wizz Air app for the best deals. Pay in AED to avoid currency conversion fees. For accommodation, look for apart-hotels or local guesthouses in Larnaca Old Town — cheaper and walkable.

Bonus tip (Turn it into a smart Europe trip): Cyprus is part of the EU’s Schengen zone, so with a Schengen visa, you can easily connect to Greece, Malta, or Italy via short hops from Larnaca — all on budget carriers. Perfect for families or couples looking to stretch one visa into a full European experience.

The flights will operate four times a week — Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays — perfect for weekend breaks or short getaways without burning leave days.Base fares start from just €24.99 (around AED 100) for a one-way ticket, available on Wizz Air’s website and app. These lowest prices are usually for early bookings and “WIZZ Basic” fares, which include only a small carry-on bag (40x30x20 cm) ideal for light travellers or those planning a quick 3–4 day trip.For travellers who need more flexibility, Wizz Air offers upgrades like:While prices can rise during holiday peaks (December–January), even mid-season fares remain below what most legacy airlines charge, often 40–60% cheaper than competitors.Round-trip tickets, when booked early, can cost as little as AED 220–250 total, making it one of the cheapest ways to reach Europe from the UAE.Larnaca is a classic budget friendly Mediterranean pick: beaches, old town charm and inexpensive tavernas. Highlights that won’t blow your budget include Finikoudes Beach, the Byzantine Church of Saint Lazarus, and the nearby Salt Lake (seasonal flamingos). Walkable, compact and with lots of cheap eats, it’s ideal for a weekend or a 4–6 day family break. Book simple guesthouses or budget hotels near the shoreline to avoid taxi costs.Flying low-cost doesn’t mean cutting corners, it means planning smart. Here’s how UAE travelers can make the most of Wizz Air’s budget fares to Cyprus without getting hit by hidden costs.This route restart is notable because Wizz Air had earlier scaled back Abu Dhabi operations, the Larnaca return (via one of Wizz’s European units) gives UAE travelers a low-cost gateway to Europe even as the carrier retools its Gulf strategy. For middle-income holidaymakers, that means shorter travel time and cheap winter sun without long haul prices competition that helps keep fares low across carriers.","Wizz Air is relaunching its Abu Dhabi–Larnaca route from 15 November 2025.

The Zayed Charity Run arrives in Rio de Janeiro on October 5, 2025, marking the event’s first stop in South America and bringing thousands of runners together to race, celebrate and raise funds for local social causes.The Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is set to take place on Saturday, October 5, marking a major milestone as the first-ever edition in South America. Hosted along Rio de Janeiro’s iconic coastline, the event will blend fitness, culture, and philanthropy in one of the world’s most picturesque race settings. This year’s Rio chapter is the second global stop of the 2025–2026 Zayed Charity Run season, following the opening leg in Beijing earlier this year. It sets the stage for a global calendar that will move through several cities including Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Miami, and Budapest before concluding mid-2026.Organizers expect a mass turnout of participants, with thousands of runners from Brazil and abroad signing up for the event. Among them will be approximately 200 participants from the UAE, including community runners, students, and representatives from various humanitarian and cultural organisations.The Rio race will also welcome over 250 international delegations, making it a powerful symbol of global unity under the banner of sport and giving. Officials from both the UAE and Brazil have noted that the event not only celebrates fitness but also strengthens bilateral ties through community engagement and goodwill.The run will feature two main routes a 5km family-friendly course and a 10km competitive race. Both are designed to be inclusive and accessible, encouraging participation from all age groups and fitness levels. Whether participants are seasoned athletes or first-time runners, the focus remains on togetherness and purpose, not just performance. The scenic routes will likely pass through some of Rio’s most recognizable landmarks, offering runners sweeping ocean views and a festive, carnival-like atmosphere along the course. Entertainment stations, cultural performances, and local volunteer groups are expected to add to the energy of the day.The Zayed Charity Run is one of the UAE’s most successful humanitarian sports initiatives, launched to honor the legacy of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding Father of the UAE. It reflects his vision of humanity, compassion, and community service through action not just words.The event began in Abu Dhabi in 2001 as a local race aimed at promoting health and social responsibility. Over the years, it evolved into an international movement that combines fitness, philanthropy, and diplomacy. Each edition raises funds for hospitals, medical research, and welfare programs in its host city all under the spirit of “giving without borders.” Unlike commercial races, the Zayed Charity Run’s core niche is humanitarian impact. Every stop donates its proceeds directly to local causes, from cancer treatment in Egypt to children’s hospitals in New York and now family welfare in Rio. The initiative has previously supported organisations such as the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City, Children’s Cancer Hospital in Cairo, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.The goal is simple yet powerful: ""Use running as a bridge between nations and people, promoting health and kindness through collective action""Beyond the race itself, the Rio event is explicitly charitable: proceeds will support local organizations that help vulnerable children, women and families including partnerships with community groups such as Rio Solidario. The National and other coverage note that funds raised at the Rio stop will be channelled into programmes on education, social support and child welfare in the host city. That local focus is central to the Zayed Charity Run’s mission combining sport, culture and humanitarian aid.Participation in the Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is open to the public, with organizers encouraging people of all backgrounds to join from professional runners to families and first-time participants. The goal is to make the event accessible while ensuring that every registration contributes to a charitable cause.Runners can sign up online through the official Zayed Charity Run portal and affiliated sports websites.Every participant receives an official race T-shirt, bib number, timing chip, and finisher’s medal, along with access to hydration stations and first-aid support throughout the route.In keeping with its international editions, the Rio leg will also offer cash prizes for top finishers, alongside symbolic awards that honour participation and sportsmanship.Beyond the race itself, the Rio edition is designed as a community festival, complete with cultural showcases, live performances, and local food stalls. Families are encouraged to attend and cheer, turning the event into a day of joy and charity. The event organisers have emphasized that participation is open to all, with proceeds from registration fees and sponsorships directly funding local social welfare initiatives.","The Zayed Charity Run Rio 2025 is set to take place on Saturday, October 5, 2025.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry.

Starting January 1, 2026, Apple will require anyone creating a new Apple Account in Texas to confirm whether they're over 18, marking a significant shift in how the company manages underage users. Minors will be locked into Family Sharing groups, giving parents and guardians approval rights over every app download, purchase, and in-app transaction.Apple announced the changes while voicing sharp concerns about the privacy trade-offs involved.

The AI arms race meets physics





Engineers are embedding synthetic diamonds into computer chips to combat the massive energy waste plaguing data centers, as companies rush to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence models that consume electricity at unprecedented rates.More than half of all energy in chips is wasted as heat leaking from transistors, according to R. Martin Roscheisen, an electrical engineer at Diamond Foundry. This heat shortens chip lifespans, reduces efficiency, and forces data centres to spend enormous resources on cooling systems. Now, researchers are turning to an unlikely material to solve this crisis: diamond.Diamond conducts heat several times faster than copper, the material traditionally used in chip cooling systems, notes Paul May, a physical chemist at the University of Bristol. The secret lies in diamond's atomic structure—each carbon atom bonds strongly to four neighbours, creating efficient pathways for heat to travel through the crystal.Companies are now manufacturing diamond layers specifically for chip cooling. Diamond Foundry grows four-inch synthetic diamond disks using carbon-rich plasma, then polishes them to atomic smoothness—no defect larger than a single atom across the entire surface.These wafers attach directly to chips, eliminating hot spots that plague conventional designs.Element Six, the industrial division of diamond giant De Beers, has developed a copper-diamond hybrid that balances performance with affordability. The material targets next-generation AI chips that generate unprecedented heat loads, potentially extending their lifespans while slashing cooling costs, the company's business development head Bruce Bolliger told the Times.The urgency has intensified as chipmakers hit physical barriers in shrinking transistors. Srabanti Chowdhury, an electrical engineer at Stanford University, is exploring diamond layers to enable vertical transistor stacking—a promising approach that generates even more problematic heat.Her research, partly funded by DARPA, focuses on growing diamonds at temperatures low enough not to damage silicon foundations. ""The problem of heat was already there, but now that the growth really came with A.I., it's like a hockey stick,"" Chowdhury told the Times.Within a few years, even home computers and mobile phones will likely include diamond heat-spreaders, according to Dr. May. However, the technology hasn't yet proven itself commercially, and researchers continue working to make production more affordable and scalable for mass-market applications.","Diamond conducts heat several times faster than copper, the material traditionally used in chip cooling systems.

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

World's youngest self-made woman billionaire Lucy Guo says that my parents viewed it as a sign that I didn’t love them when I ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-youngest-self-made-woman-billionaire-lucy-guo-says-that-my-parents-viewed-it-as-a-sign-that-i-didnt-love-them-when-i-/articleshow/124317958.cms,"Lucy Guo





At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo’s meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.“They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,” Guo told CNBC Make It. “For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.” “I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them, and they weren’t very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,” she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. “I think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them,” Guo said. “It was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.” Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.“One to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you’re going to make the best friends in college, and you’re going to meet the smartest people,” she told CNBC Make It. “There’s no other scenario where there’s such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.”Guo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform.

Full text of Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Arattai is on the surface a simple product but it has a lot of depth inside.

Let me list the engineering frameworks (all homegrown) that power Arattai.

First is what we call our messaging/AV framework. This has been the ""real time"" workhorse of Zoho for a while and this is what offers you those crisp calls and meetings that connect quickly. It has been perfected for 15 years.

Then we have a distributed framework that allows us to distribute the workload among many servers and databases, and provides fault tolerance, performance monitoring, security and so on. This is the backbone of Zoho and powers a lot of what you see on the surface and also keeps our systems secure. We have been perfecting this for over 20 years now!

We have teams actively working on these frameworks and they provide strong support to the Arattai team.

Our staying power comes from the depth of all the R&D we do. Recently I have moved full time to R&D and you will see many more innovations from us.





Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu recently said that being a dedicated engineer is like being a Rishi. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu highlighted that the company’s recently launched messaging platform – Arattai may see a “simple product” on the surface, but “has a lot of depth inside”. Praising the Arattai team, he wrote “all of you have worked hard for over 5 years without expecting that the product would ever take off.” “Allow neither praise nor criticism nor fame to distract you, resolutely stay the course,” Vembu added.In the post, he also shed light on the engineering framework that power Arattai.
