xQc Suggests a “Side Character” for Speed’s Streams



Backlash Over Alleged Bias

The Community Divided

With the incendiary remarks on the YouTube content and its CEO, Darren “IShowSpeed” Watkins Jr, xQc has managed to instigate online banter once again. On the 2nd of September 2025, a segment of his stream was shared that started rather extreme reactions on both sides of the feud.In light of the ongoing Speed Does America marathon, xQc decided to throw his opinion in. The French-Canadian streamer suggested that Speed’s content would have additional layers if such dynamics were added. “Alright, chat, listen; I think this might sound off the wall, but it would be great comedic relief if Speed had a side character for the stream. Maybe his cameraman, Slipz, starts fake production and becomes more of a character. I think it will help out a lot.” While a number of fans took this from its face value and saw it as an attempt to offer advice, an equal number of people were quick to jump to its defense and felt like xQc was trying to say that Speed couldn’t hold his streams by himself.As the video circulated on social media, it sparked controversy and further accusations that xQc has a habit of criticizing Black content creators. One user’s comment, which stated, ""Dude literally just hates on every black streamer"" gained immediate traction.Later the same day, yet another clip caused a stir. This time, xQc was noted for speaking about Speed’s cross-platform live viewer count. He remarked on how Speed is known for pulling huge numbers on YouTube, especially given that he and other streamers don’t have the algorithmic advantages or search tools that others use:“Speed gets 50k on YouTube with zero discoverability. Zero bots. Zero synthetic push. These are numbers that are, like, as raw as you can get them. And everyone knows Speed. Everyone knows him, like, everywhere.”Online feedback has been rather polarized. To one side, Speed’s supporters blamed xQc for having envious issues, attacking a streamer who has established himself outside of the Twitch ecosystem. On the other side, there were defenders for xQc, proposing that his remarks were less social media trolling and more stating the facts, and that he has a reputation for critiquing content creation methods no matter who the person is.Alongside IShowSpeed, xQc is also one of the most renowned live streamers, each having their own unique audience from their different platforms. This recent conflict shows just how childish and ego-driven the world of streaming is, as fan groups immediately jump to the defense of their preferred creators.Whether or not there was any truth in xQc’s “side character” theory, the reaction pinpoints one thing with undeniable clarity, discussions about Speed transcend the content he produces, they touch on matters of balanced online culture, shifting online entertainment, and the elements of identity and success therein.","Darren “IShowSpeed” Watkins Jr has managed to instigate online banter once again.

A vision that sounded absurd



From skepticism to ubiquity



Microsoft co-founder and once the world’s richest man Bill Gates is again making headlines. A clip from 1995 has again surfaced online showing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates being laughed at during a live interview for his bold predictions about the Internet. The viral clip doing the rounds of the internet is from The Late Show with David Letterman . In the clip Gates was seen being laughed at for trying to explain the potential of the internet.On November 27, 1995, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates appeared on The Late Show to talk about the internet. Speaking about it, Bill Gates addressed the internet as the ‘new big thing’. Gates explained that people will be able to publish information, create homepage and also send electronic mail using internet. However, the host of the show responded with mockery and compared the features of the internet with the then available technologies.“You could listen to a baseball game on your computer,” Gates said. Letterman shot back, “Does radio ring a bell?” prompting laughter from the audience. Bill Gates clarified that users could listen to games anytime, to which Letterman replied, “Do tape recorders ring a bell?”Along with this, Bill Gates also talked about internet’s ability to connect people with niche interests also offer continuous updated information. Letterman dismissed the idea with a joke about ‘loner chat rooms’ underscoring how unfamiliar and unnecessary the internet seemed at the time.The clip, recently shared by tech-focused social media pages, has been praised for its “wholesome” and “innocent” tone. But more importantly, it serves as a reminder that even the most transformative innovations often sound ridiculous before they become indispensable.All the features that Bill Gates described back then have now become a reality. The interview now stands as a testament to visionary thinking and the resistance it often faces. From laughter to legacy, Bill Gates’ moment on late-night television is a powerful snapshot of how the future often arrives disguised as folly.",A clip from 1995 has again surfaced online showing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates being laughed at during a live interview for his bold predictions about the Internet.

Google antitrust ruling: Court says Google can keep Android and Chrome but will have to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-antitrust-ruling-court-says-google-can-keep-android-and-chrome-but-will-have-to-/articleshow/123672479.cms,"AI seen as new competitive threat



Apple deal survives, investors cheer



Other restrictions on Google



What’s next for Google



In a landmark antitrust ruling, the US District Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google can retain its Android operating system and Chrome browser . Along with this, the ruling also stated that the company can also keep the lucrative deal with Apple. But, Google will now have to share search data with its rivals in order to open up competition in the online search market. As reported by Reuters, this decision is followed by a five-year legal battle in which regulators accused Google of maintaining illegal monopoly in search and related advertising. While the court stopped short of ordering a breakup of Google’s core products. But the data sharing mandate is seen as a significant step toward levelling the playing field for competitors, including emerging AI-powered search tools.As per the Reuters report, Judge Mehta also noted that artificial intelligence companies such as OpenAI and developing advanced chatbots and AI search engines, are “better placed to compete with Google than any search engine developer has been in decades”. By giving them access to Google Search data could help in accelerating innovation and reducing the company dominance in the sector.Along with Android operating system and Google Chrome, the court has also allowed Google to continue paying Apple — reportedly around $20 billion annually in order to remain the default search engine on its devices. After this judgement, the shares of Alphabet rose by 7.2% and Apple also gained 3% in extended trading.As per the Reuters report, the judgement has barred Google from entering exclusive contracts which prevent the device makers and carriers from preloading rival search apps. Recent agreements with Samsung, Motorola, AT&T, and Verizon already reflect this shift, allowing more flexibility for competitors.Google has expressed its concerns over sharing search data as it could impact the privacy of its users. The company is reviewing the decision, with plans to appeal — a process that could take years and potentially reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling is part of a broader bipartisan crackdown on Big Tech, with ongoing cases against Meta, Amazon, and Apple.","US District Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google can retain its Android operating system and Chrome browser.

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame.

Dead Sea mystery: Strange 'salt snow' could explain hidden structures below,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/dead-sea-mystery-strange-salt-snow-could-explain-hidden-structures-below/articleshow/123678887.cms,"

What is ‘ salt snow ’ of Dead Sea

How the Dead Sea became a natural laboratory



Salt giants beneath the surface



Climate change and its role



Why it matters globally





In one of the most unusual natural discoveries of recent years, scientists have observed what they call “salt snow” falling beneath the surface of the Dead Sea. Unlike normal snowfall, this strange process happens underwater as halite crystals form and descend like snowflakes. Researchers believe this rare phenomenon may help explain how massive underground salt structures such as chimneys, domes, and kilometer-thick deposits are created. Triggered by climate change, evaporation, and water diversion, the “salt snow” not only reshapes the Dead Sea but also offers clues to Earth’s geological past.Salt snow refers to the precipitation of halite crystals within the Dead Sea. Normally, salt crystallization is seen in shallow or cold water layers, but here it occurs year-round, even during summer. The process begins when surface water becomes warmer and saltier due to evaporation. This dense water cools and sinks, while colder, less salty water from below rises. The mixing of these layers triggers crystal formation in mid-water zones, creating the illusion of snow falling underwater.The Dead Sea is the lowest point on Earth’s surface and one of the saltiest water bodies in the world, making it uniquely suited for such phenomena.Historically, its water remained layered and stable. But since the 1980s, reduced inflow from the Jordan River and intensified evaporation have disrupted this balance. As a result, annual mixing of water layers now fuels continuous salt crystallization. Unlike other seas such as the Red Sea or the Mediterranean, where similar processes ended millions of years ago, the Dead Sea remains active, offering a living glimpse into Earth’s geological history.These falling crystals accumulate over time, forming vast salt structures beneath the seabed. Known as salt giants, chimneys, and domes, they can reach more than a kilometer in thickness and extend over vast distances. Such formations are crucial for geologists because they mirror conditions during the Messinian Salinity Crisis over 5 million years ago, when the Mediterranean dried up and massive salt deposits were left behind. The Dead Sea now serves as a smaller-scale model of that ancient process.The salt snow is not just a scientific curiosity, it reflects wider environmental shifts. Climate change, combined with human-driven freshwater diversion, has caused the Dead Sea’s water level to drop by about one meter per year. This accelerates salinity increases and alters stratification, intensifying salt precipitation. The unusual “snowfall” thus acts as a visible marker of climate stress on fragile ecosystems, highlighting how human activities and warming temperatures reshape natural processes.Understanding the Dead Sea’s salt snow provides more than local insights. These formations record climate fluctuations and hydrological imbalances, offering a geological archive of environmental change. On a broader scale, studying this phenomenon could shed light on how coastal systems respond to rising salinity and climate change worldwide. It also informs research into erosion, resource extraction, and the stability of other saltwater basins.","Scientists have observed what they call “salt snow” falling beneath the surface of the Dead Sea.

Stone Age underwater city: A window into prehistoric life

Broader research and scientific significance





Archaeologists have uncovered a remarkably well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast. Dubbed the “Stone Age Atlantis,” the site went underwater as massive ice sheets melted at the end of the last Ice Age, raising sea levels and flooding coastal communities. Preserved in an oxygen-free underwater environment, the settlement has effectively become a “time capsule,” halting decomposition and providing unprecedented insight into early human life. Artefacts, including wooden tools, arrowheads, animal bones, hazelnuts, and seal teeth, reveal a thriving Mesolithic society skilled in fishing, hunting, and crafting tools.The settlement offers a rare glimpse into Mesolithic life. Archaeologists have excavated about 430 square feet at a depth of 26 feet, uncovering evidence of organised human activity. Wooden tools, stone implements, and food remnants, such as hazelnuts, indicate a society that relied on fishing, hunting, and gathering. The site’s preservation provides valuable information on how early humans adapted to environmental changes, particularly rising sea levels that transformed coastlines and habitats.Researchers employed specialised underwater technologies, including vacuum systems, to safely recover artefacts without damaging them. The oxygen-free conditions preserved both organic and inorganic materials, allowing archaeologists to study Mesolithic tools, structures, and dietary remains in remarkable detail. Experts describe the site as a “time capsule,” where everything feels as though time has stopped, offering unique insights into prehistoric human life.This discovery is part of a six-year, €15.5 million European Union-funded project mapping submerged prehistoric landscapes across the North and Baltic Seas. Scientists aim to reconstruct coastal human activity, subsistence strategies, and adaptation to climate change during the post-Ice Age period. The Aarhus site complements other submerged settlements, including locations near Alexandria, Egypt, and lakes in North America, shedding light on how ancient civilisations responded to rising waters and changing environments. The artefacts offer a fascinating glimpse into everyday life in the Stone Age. They also highlight the skill and ingenuity of early humans in using available resources.Stone Age Atlantis demonstrates how early humans thrived despite environmental challenges. Artefacts such as fishing tools, seal remains, and arrowheads highlight their ingenuity, while the preserved settlement layout suggests organised community life. Beyond archaeology, the site offers valuable lessons for modern societies on climate resilience, illustrating how humans have historically adapted to rising sea levels—insights that remain highly relevant today. The Stone Age Atlantis discovery not only enriches our understanding of prehistoric human ingenuity but also underscores the enduring importance of studying ancient responses to environmental change.","Archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Stone Age settlement submerged around 8,500 years ago beneath the waters of the Bay of Aarhus, off Denmark’s coast.

Tiny robot captures secrets of the Great Pyramid: Exploring Queen's hidden Chamber for the first time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/tiny-robot-captures-secrets-of-the-great-pyramid-exploring-queens-hidden-chamber-for-the-first-time/articleshow/123578165.cms,"

A remarkable journey inside the Great Pyramid



Hidden symbols and their potential meaning

Preserving history through technology





For more than 4,500 years, Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza has intrigued explorers, historians, and archaeologists, holding mysteries that have long eluded discovery. Now, a tiny, purpose-built robot weighing just 5 kg has offered an unprecedented glimpse into one of the pyramid’s most inaccessible areas: a narrow shaft leading out of the Queen’s Chamber. Designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure, the robot captured footage that revealed previously unseen chambers and intricate painted symbols on the stone floor, challenging traditional assumptions about the pyramid’s construction and purpose.The robot’s journey is part of the Djedi Project, led by engineers from the University of Leeds in collaboration with inventor Dr. Tze Chuen Ng. Their goal was to explore the mysterious shafts without harming the centuries-old stones, combining ingenuity, robotics, and patience over several years. This small device’s careful ascent has opened a window into the secrets of a monument that has fascinated the world for millennia.The Queen’s Chamber shaft, which rises at a 40-degree angle, had long resisted exploration due to its narrow dimensions.Previous attempts to probe it caused damage, making a safe, non-invasive approach essential. After nearly five years of development, the tiny 5 kg robot was able to navigate the 60-meter shaft gently, bypassing one blocking stone with a flexible camera arm.Beyond it, the robot discovered a small sealed chamber featuring colored symbols painted directly on the stone floor, hinting at symbolic or ritualistic significance. A second stone further along the shaft blocked the robot, leaving what lies beyond still unknown. The discovery adds yet another layer to the ongoing mystery of the Great Pyramid, showing that even the smallest spaces may hide details of great cultural value.It also reinforces the idea that every exploration inside this monument brings the world a step closer to understanding how and why it was built. The painted symbols may also offer clues about the daily lives or beliefs of workers who built the pyramid.The discovery of painted markings challenges the idea that the shafts served solely as air vents. Experts suggest the artwork may indicate ceremonial or symbolic purposes, possibly tied to ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife and the pharaoh’s soul. The deliberate placement of multiple stones also suggests intentional concealment, reinforcing the theory that these spaces had more than just architectural function. The project highlights the growing role of interdisciplinary collaboration, showing how engineers, archaeologists, and historians can work together to solve ancient mysteries. It emphasizes that even the most delicate explorations can yield invaluable insights when guided by innovation and care.Though further exploration is on hold due to security concerns in Egypt, the robot’s footage provides a rare and invaluable view into these long-hidden chambers. The discoveries have reignited worldwide fascination with ancient Egypt, inspiring both researchers and enthusiasts to look closer at the pyramids’ hidden secrets. Experts believe that continued technological innovation may uncover even more chambers, reshaping our understanding of Egyptian history.Such findings remind us that the Great Pyramid is not just an architectural wonder but also a cultural and spiritual symbol. Each new clue adds to its enduring story, proving that its mysteries are far from exhausted even after thousands of years. The painted symbols may also offer clues about the daily lives or beliefs of workers who built the pyramid. If future explorations succeed, these chambers could reveal details about rituals, astronomy, or record-keeping practices of ancient Egypt.While the full mysteries of the Great Pyramid remain elusive, the tiny robot’s expedition demonstrates the potential of modern technology to illuminate ancient secrets. By combining robotics, careful engineering, and digital documentation, researchers have not only avoided damaging the pyramid but also sparked renewed global interest in Egyptology.The released footage allows historians, archaeologists, and the public to engage with these discoveries directly, offering insights into a monument that continues to inspire awe more than four millennia after its construction. The Djedi Project team hopes to resume exploration once conditions in Egypt allow, potentially unlocking more hidden chambers. This breakthrough shows how the smallest tools can sometimes unlock the biggest mysteries of human history.These findings could mark just the beginning of a new era in non-invasive archaeology. Such breakthroughs highlight how robotics can act as a bridge between modern science and ancient civilizations. Each discovery brings humanity closer to solving one of history’s greatest architectural mysteries. The ongoing work of the Djedi Project promises to reveal even deeper secrets of the Great Pyramid in the years to come.",The robot was designed to navigate the 20 cm by 20 cm passage without damaging the ancient structure.

Looking Ahead

Partial Lunar Eclipse — July 6, 2028

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE — December 31, 2028

This will align with New Year’s Eve, offering a second dramatic Blood Moon in just over three years.





On the night of September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory — an 82-minute stretch of totality that will turn the Moon a vivid red. The event will be visible from all seven emirates, with global livestreams and local public viewings set to make the spectacle accessible to millions.A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow — the umbra — across the Moon’s surface. During this alignment, sunlight bends through the Earth’s atmosphere, scattering blue light and allowing red tones to reach and reflect off the Moon, creating the phenomenon popularly known as a Blood Moon.This particular eclipse stands out for two reasons:The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG) emphasizes that this combination of extended totality and widespread visibility makes the September 7 eclipse especially significant.The celestial spectacle will unfold over almost five and a half hours, beginning with the faint penumbral eclipse, progressing through the partial phases, and culminating in the most visually dramatic stage, totality, when the Moon will be completely immersed in Earth’s umbra and appear red in color.This breathtaking phase will be fully visible across all seven emirates, starting in the late evening and continuing past 10:30 PM.During this 82-minute window, the Moon will take on varying shades of red depending on atmospheric conditions, dust levels, and light pollution.The Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), founded in 2000, has played a central role in popularising astronomy and space science across the Middle East. Over the past two decades, it has established itself as the region’s leading authority in the field, offering expert consultancy to government bodies and major private-sector institutions.DAG actively promotes public engagement with astronomy through a range of initiatives, including outdoor astronomical observations, public lectures, exhibitions, and conferences. The group also maintains an in-house resource centre and leverages social media to reach a wider audience. Dedicated observing sites further support its mission of making the night sky accessible to all.In line with this mission, DAG will host a public viewing event in Dubai, offering telescopes, expert guidance, and group observation sessions. Event details, including the venue and registration process, will be announced soon.A special highlight of the event will be a curated photo moment capturing the Blood Moon as it rises behind the Burj Khalifa, in collaboration with acclaimed photographer Rami Dibo.To include international audiences, DAG will host a global livestream, featuring:This coordinated broadcast aims to connect skywatchers around the world in a shared experience of the eclipse.Lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no glasses or filters are needed. For the best view:","Totality will last for 82 minutes, making it one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent years. It will be visible to 87% of the world's population, giving a vast portion of Earth’s residents the chance to witness the Moon turning deep red. The celestial spectacle will unfold over almost five and a half hours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123612558,imgsize-1042282,width-400,resizemode-4/lunar-eclipse.jpg"

Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas. This new mandate comes as part of a government crackdown on unlicensed co-living arrangements, aiming to ensure that only authorized residents occupy rented properties. The change requires tenants to provide full details of everyone living in their unit, regardless of whether they are the primary tenant or a co-occupant. With this step, Dubai’s authorities are tightening enforcement of tenancy laws, ensuring that only those officially listed are permitted to reside in a property.As of recent, landlords in Dubai have started scrutinizing the details included in Ejari contracts to ensure that the names of all individuals residing in a property are listed. The rules are simple: any person staying in the unit for a month or longer must be entered into the system using the Dubai REST app. Failure to do so can lead to complications, with landlords pressing tenants to provide the missing information.The initiative comes as the Dubai Land Department (DLD) intensifies efforts to eliminate unlicensed co-living arrangements. Landlords who continue to violate these regulations face stringent penalties, as the authorities adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards unauthorized shared living.The process of registering co-living individuals on the Ejari system is straightforward, especially with the help of the Dubai REST app, The Ejari contracts are registered with the Dubai Land Department in the name of either the principal tenant or the landlord.Tenants must follow these steps to update their records:The updated rules apply to family members, domestic help, and any other co-occupants who reside in the unit. This is crucial for tenants who wish to avoid issues when dealing with government agencies, utilities, and landlords.Ejari, which means ""My Rent"" in Arabic, is a mandatory rental registration system introduced by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) under the Dubai Land Department (DLD) in 2007. It serves as the backbone of Dubai’s rental market, ensuring that all agreements are legally documented. Here's why Ejari matters:By ensuring that all co-residents are accurately recorded, Ejari adds transparency to Dubai’s rental market and helps maintain accountability.With stricter enforcement of housing laws, the importance of complying with Ejari regulations cannot be overstated. Tenants benefit from Ejari by ensuring their rental agreements are properly documented, which is essential when setting up utilities, renewing visas, or even resolving disputes. For landlords, having a valid and properly registered Ejari contract provides legal protection and ensures they are not unintentionally breaking any laws.Furthermore, the recent crackdown on unlicensed shared living arrangements is a reminder for tenants to be diligent about their housing agreements. Landlords who permit unauthorized occupants without the proper registrations face heavy penalties, which may include fines or even loss of their ability to lease properties.As part of Dubai’s broader digital transformation efforts, a new update rolled out in June has made Ejari registration more accessible than ever. Through a joint initiative between the Dubai Land Department (DLD) and Injaz Real Estate Registration Trustee, tenants can now complete the process remotely via WhatsApp, using the AQARI platform.Originally launched in August 2024 to streamline services such as title deed data amendments and property valuations, AQARI has evolved into one of the UAE’s most comprehensive remote property service platforms with the addition of Ejari registration in June 2025.This new service simplifies the process significantly, eliminating the need for in-person visits. Tenants can start by visiting the AQARI platform and clicking the WhatsApp chat icon, which launches an automated chat to guide users through various services, including:With access to 10 DLD-approved Service Trustees through WhatsApp, users can complete these transactions from anywhere in the world. This advancement supports Dubai’s smart governance goals while enhancing convenience for both landlords and tenants.","Dubai tenants are now required to update their Ejari contracts with the details of all individuals living in their apartments or villas.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

What the new chatter suggests

Prince Andrew Snaps At Staff After Man Reads Aloud Extract From Controversial Biography 'Entitled'

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses.

US President Donald Trump addressed a viral video during his Oval Office announcement on Wednesday, in which an object appears to be dumped from a White House window—a clip that has sparked intense speculation online.Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy showed Trump the footage, which has gone viral on X, with millions of viewers asking the same question: What was in the bag?“No, that's probably AI-generated. You can't open the windows. They're all heavily-armored. I know every window up there. The last place I'd be doing it is there,” Trump said. He added, “They're sealed, and each window weighs about 600 pounds.”The video shows the object sailing through the air before hitting the ground. While the act appears to violate standard White House security protocols, neither the Secret Service nor the White House provided any explanation, deepening the mystery and fueling online speculation.Social media users quickly reacted with a mix of theories and humor. “It’s Melania. She is sneaking out before the Epstein files are exposed because her phone # is in them as well!” one user claimed. Another suggested, “That’s the bathroom connected to the Lincoln bedroom.They’re gutting it because Trump doesn’t like art deco. Ironically, the demo starts on Labor Day.”Others pointed to ongoing renovations at the White House. “Construction workers are throwing trash out of the window, these are the very same people Trump wants to report are doing the rehab work for him,” one user wrote. Another added, “There’s renovation in the White House… Pres. Trump has talked about it before…”","The video shows the object sailing through the air before hitting the ground.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Mangione case sparks 'Dark Fandom'

Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein has launched an investigation after an image of Luigi Mangione , who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was used to model a shirt on its website. The image, which showed a likeness of Mangione wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt, has since been removed. The shirt was reportedly listed for just under $10. A Shein spokesperson told BBC News that the image was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery.Incidentally, this is not the first time that Mangione's likeness has caused a major company a headache. In December 2024, the BBC complained to Apple after its new AI-powered ""Apple Intelligence"" feature falsely generated a summary stating that Mangione had shot himself. Apple later suspended the feature due to this and some other errors.""We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies."" It is currently unknown how long the image was featured on the site or who the vendor was.The image's origin remains unclear, but many online have speculated it was created using artificial intelligence (AI). The BBC report said that BBC Verify used the facial recognition tool Amazon Rekognition, which found a 99.9% similarity score between the Shein image and a real photo of Mangione from his court appearance.Generative AI expert Henry Ajder noted that the low-resolution image has several signs of being AI-generated or manipulated, including unusual lighting and skin texture, as well as a ""blob-like artifact"" and atypical finger segmentation on the right hand. He added that generating such an image with AI is significantly faster and easier than manual photo editing.Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested last December and pleaded not guilty to all federal charges of murder and stalking in April. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The public reaction to the case has been intense, sparking what some have dubbed a ""dark fandom"" fueled by anger toward America's private healthcare system.
