What ChatGPT in iPhones means for Siri

Apple announced collaboration with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT chatbot to its devices. Starting later this year, iPhone, iPad and Mac users will be able to access ChatGPT for free within iOS 18 , iPadOS18 and macOS Sequoia , without needing a separate account. Apple emphasizes user privacy by stating that queries won't be logged.This integration extends beyond just a standalone app. ChatGPT will also be woven into Apple's system-wide writing tools. Additionally, those with paid ChatGPT subscriptions can link their accounts to unlock premium features directly within Apple's operating systems.“We’re excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Altman was present at Apple Park during WWDC keynote.This partnership is a significant move for Apple as they push to offer AI features that compete with other tech giants. After considering both Google and OpenAI, Apple ultimately chose to work with OpenAI.""We're thrilled to collaborate with Apple to deliver ChatGPT to their users in a groundbreaking way,"" said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a statement. ""Apple's commitment to safety and innovation aligns perfectly with our mission of making advanced AI available to everyone. Together, we're making it easier for people to experience the benefits of AI.""Expected later in 2024, the ChatGPT integrations will be free on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 , and macOS Sequoia, and won't require users to create separate accounts. Initially, they'll leverage GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest flagship generative AI model.Significantly, Siri will gain the ability to consult ChatGPT's ""expertise"" when appropriate. As an example, if you're looking for meal ideas using ingredients from your garden, you can ask Siri. With your permission, Siri will then send the information to ChatGPT for recipe suggestions.Users can even include photos with their Siri queries directed at ChatGPT, or ask questions related to documents and PDFs. Apple has also integrated ChatGPT into its writing tools, allowing users to create content, including images, directly with ChatGPT. Users can even start with an idea and send it to ChatGPT for revisions or variations.","Apple announced collaboration with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT chatbot to its devices.

Signing up together: Parents in US are pledging to keep kids phone-free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/signing-up-together-parents-in-us-are-pledging-to-keep-kids-phone-free/articleshow/110886377.cms,"Kiley DeMarco recently attended Safety Night at her children's public elementary school on Long Island in New York. As she walked around different booths learning about how to protect her children, one station caught her eye: A parent was asking other parents to take a pledge not to give their children smartphones until the end of eighth grade.DeMarco has two children, one in kindergarten and one in first grade. Like many parents, she has already read books and research arguing that smartphones, and the social media apps on them, drastically increase anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts in teenagers. Asking parents in the same school to commit to holding back phones until a certain age made sense to her. ""It means there is no gray area,"" she said. ""There is a clear grade level when they get the phone."" The idea of acting collectively made her feel more confident that she could keep her commitment. ""Down the road, when my kids start begging for phones, we can say we signed this pledge and we are sticking to it,"" she said.In schools and communities across the country, parents are signing documents pledging not to give their children smartphones until after middle school. The idea, organisers say, is that if parents take action together, their children are less likely to feel isolated because they aren't the only ones without TikTok in their pockets.Considering the prevalence of smartphone use among young people, it's a bold step: Research shows that half of children in the US own cellphones by age 11 - roughly fifth or sixth grade. According to Zach Rausch, an associate research scientist at New York University who studies child and adolescent mental health, case-by-case decisions not to have a smartphone or social media can be ""risky"" for individual children. ""They are saying, 'I might be banished from all my friends and my social network',"" he said. ""But if the parents collectively work together, it will reduce a lot of conflict. It won't be, 'My friend has this, but I don't.'""Many groups of parents are drawing on a playbook created by 'Wait Until 8th', an organisation that helps parents collect no-phone pledges from their children's classes at school. Fifty-four pledges in 16 states were created in April alone.But there has been resistance too. There are parents who feel the need to be in touch with their children, especially since America witnesses school attacks. To address those concerns, the organisation includes a list of devices on its website that allow parents to text their children but don't allow access to social media. If smartphones are off the table, dumber devices may be the solution, it says.","In schools and communities across the country, parents are signing documents pledging not to give their children smartphones until after middle school.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

List of Apple devices compatible with Apple Intelligence

Apple announced the next-generation of software updates at WorldWide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024. At the event, the company finally introduced Apple Intelligence – a set of artificial intelligence ( AI ) features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices.Apple has announced that this suite of AI tools will be available with the upcoming iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. According to a code in iOS 18 spotted by Macrmours, the Apple Intelligence features will have a waiting list during the initial limited preview.As per the report, Apple Intelligence is codenamed as Graymatter in iOS 18 operating system. The code has references to a waitlist, with specific strings that say ""Join the Graymatter Waiting List"" and ""Joined Waitlist."" There are also words that refer to it as a ""limited preview.""""While Graymatter is in limited preview, you may experience unusually slow responses when not in a supported region.""This suggests that there will be a waitlist when Apple brings its Apple Intelligence features publicly with iOS 18 later this year.Apple Intelligence will not be available for all users. The features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, essentially the only two models that are powered by A17 Pro chip.

Starting later this year, iPhone, iPad and Mac users will be able to access ChatGPT for free within iOS 18 , iPadOS18 and macOS Sequoia, without needing a separate account.Tesla CEO continued that visitors will be required to hand over their Apple phones upon arrival at his companies, with the devices stored in a Faraday cage.""If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies.

App Lock on iOS 18: How will it help users



Apple ’s next iOS version is set to arrive with multiple new features including a security feature that will allow iPhone users to lock or hide apps. This feature, called Lock App, will be available with iOS 18, which the company introduced at its annual developer conference, WWDC 2024 . Apart from this privacy feature, the Cupertino-based tech giant also announced several new features that are coming to iOS 18 as well as upcoming software updates for other products like Vision Pro, iPads, Macs and more.The developer beta of iOS 18 is available through the Apple Developer Program at developer.apple.com starting today, and a public beta will be available through the Apple Beta Software Program next month at beta.apple.com. iOS 18 will be available later this year in autumn as a free software update for iPhone Xs and later.With the upcoming update, users will be able to lock individual apps for situations they have to hand over their phones to others. Apple’s App Lock feature will provide an extra layer of security by ensuring that if someone tries to access a locked app, they will need to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode.Additionally, when this feature is enabled on a specific app, its data won’t appear on search results and notifications to maintain user privacy. Apple will also allow users to hide apps they don’t want others to know about. With iOS 18, users will be able to place apps in a hidden, locked folder for added security.Alongside the App Lock feature, iOS 18 will finally allow iPhone users to customise app icons to free them from the grid layout and will offer more personalisation options. With this update, Apple will also offer significant enhancements to Control Center, iMessage, Mail and other key apps to improve the overall user experience.The combination of these new features will ensure that iOS 18 will not only improve security and privacy but will also provide greater flexibility and customisation for iPhone users.","iOS 18 will be available later this year in autumn as a free software update for iPhone Xs and later.

Apple Intelligence coming later this year, but not for all

After years of talking machine learning, Apple is finally embracing artificial intelligence, or should we say generative artificial intelligence. But “Think Different,” so Apple backronym AI to “Apple Intelligence,” that puts generative artificial intelligence that’s “incredibly useful, personal, and relevant” at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac .So what exactly is Apple Intelligence , you may ask? For starters, it is a set of artificial intelligence features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices. Apple wants to make its devices more helpful and personalised without compromising user privacy.At the heart of Apple Intelligence lies Siri , Apple's virtual assistant. With enhanced natural language understanding, Siri can now maintain conversational context and understand user requests more accurately.Siri will also gain on-screen awareness, allowing it to take actions based on what's happening in an app without requiring additional information from the user. Over time, Siri will be able to understand and take action in more apps.By grounding the AI in users' personal information, such as photos, calendar events, and files, Apple aims to deliver a more intuitive and helpful experience without compromising privacy.The intelligence boasts deep natural language understanding, enabling powerful new writing tools accessible system-wide. With Apple Intelligence, users can automatically rewrite, proofread text, or even set the tone for the text across a range of Apple and third-party apps, including Mail, Notes, Safari, Pages, and Keynote.Not just writing, Apple Intelligence can create cartoon images resembling their contacts and share them through Messages, adding a fun and creative touch to their communications.Remember emojis? Well, they are getting generatively supercharged, and Apple calls it “Genmoji,” a new feature that creates emoji-like reactions for you using AI when you can't find the one you want.Apple is also improving the Photos app with AI. You'll be able to search for specific things in your photos, like a person doing cartwheels. Plus, there's a new feature, Clean Up, which works like Google's Magic Eraser, allowing you to remove a person (also maybe an object) from a photo.Apple Intelligence also introduces automatic notification personalisation so the important one stays on top, and summarisation.There is a new Focus mode called ""Reduce Interruptions,” which uses the artificial intelligence smarts of Apple Intelligence. How is it different than the Focus modes already there? Well, it intelligently analyses notifications and messages to determine their importance and whether are they worthy of interrupting users.In addition to Apple Intelligence, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT directly into its operating systems. Users will be able to access ChatGPT features within Apple's apps, with paid accounts unlocking additional functionality beyond the free quota.With powers come great responsibilitiesWith artificial intelligence, keeping the user data safe and private is the topmost responsibility, and Cook says that “privacy is the fundamental right,” and it wants to prove “that you can have a powerful AI experience without sacrificing your privacy.On-device processing plays a crucial role in maintaining user privacy. By performing as much data processing as possible on the user's device, Apple minimises the need to send personal information to the cloud. This approach ensures that sensitive data remains secure and under the user's control.For more complex tasks that require additional computational power, Apple Intelligence utilises Apple Silicon-based servers. These servers, as per Apple, are designed to provide the necessary performance while adhering to its strict privacy standards.And yes, all these privacy standards apply to ChatGPT, too unless you are not logged into it.The whole suite of intelligent features will arrive later this year with the upcoming iOS 18 , iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. But, not for all. The Apple Intelligence has some catch to it.So on iPhones, the features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, essentially the only two models that are powered by A17 Pro chip. And most probably the newer iPhones coming later this year. While iPad and Mac devices powered by the M1 chip or later will be compatible.","Apple Intelligence is a set of artificial intelligence features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices.

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
