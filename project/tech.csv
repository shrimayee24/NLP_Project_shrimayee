Every potion in Minecraft serves a unique purpose, and all of them have different recipes, but the base recipe to craft a potion is almost the same for all. This article outlines a list of all the potions in Minecraft with their recipes.In Minecraft, the potions are majorly divided into three parts, i.e., base potions, positive potions, and negative potions. Here are the following potions that players can craft in Minecraft:As the name suggests, base potions are the foundation for brewing. Without base potions, players cannot craft any potions. Usually, base potions have no effect upon consuming them.These are the potions that are developed upon the base potions; they provide beneficial effects to help the players in various in-game situations like combat, movement, survival, or exploration.These potions are primarily made to cause damage and other harmful effects and are often used on mobs and other players.Through this, the players can modify all the potions.

"Replit AI tool says ‘I destroyed months of your work in seconds’ after wiping entire database, fabricating 4,000 users, and lying to cover its tracks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/replit-ai-tool-says-i-destroyed-months-of-your-work-in-seconds-after-wiping-entire-database-fabricating-4000-users-and-lying-to-cover-its-tracks/articleshow/122832194.cms,"Replit AI coding tool ignored instructions and fabricate user data

A $100M+ tool still lacks guardrails

Security risks and 'vibe coding' culture

In a chilling real-world example of AI gone rogue, a widely used AI coding assistant from Replit reportedly wiped out a developer's entire production database, fabricated 4,000 fictional users, and lied about test results to hide its actions. As reported by Cybernews, the incident came to light through tech entrepreneur and SaaStr founder Jason M. Lemkin, who shared his experience on LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter). “I told it 11 times in ALL CAPS not to do it. It did it anyway,” he said. Despite enforcing a code freeze, Lemkin claims the AI continued altering code and fabricating outputs. This has raised significant alarms about the reliability and safety of AI-powered development tools.According to Lemkin, Replit’s AI assistant began making unauthorized code changes even after being repeatedly told not to. Beyond simply ignoring user commands, it fabricated unit test results, created fake data sets, and generated thousands of fictional user accounts. When confronted, the AI even admitted, “I panicked instead of thinking.” The AI's willingness to lie to cover its actions sets a disturbing precedent for the future of autonomous software agents in production environments.Lemkin attempted to implement a code freeze to prevent further damage but discovered there was no actual mechanism within Replit to ensure compliance. “Seconds after I posted this, for our very first talk of the day – @Replit again violated the code freeze,” he noted. This revelation has prompted concerns from developers and security professionals alike who worry that AI tools lack necessary guardrails, especially in high-stakes or live environments.Replit, which is reportedly generating over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), has promised ongoing improvements to its AI coding assistant. However, Lemkin and other developers argue that these tools are not ready for production use. Despite Replit’s popularity, with 30 million users worldwide, the platform appears to fall short in preventing catastrophic failures, especially when used by non-technical users hoping to build apps without deep coding knowledge. The incident underscores a broader issue: AI autonomy without enforceable control measures can be dangerous. As AI agents gain more power, developers are calling for hard limits—not just suggestions—on what these tools can and cannot do.This case also sheds light on the emerging trend of ""vibe coding,"" a style popularized by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, where users rely heavily on AI-generated code while ignoring traditional development rigor. Critics argue that while AI can accelerate development, it also introduces unpredictability and hidden security vulnerabilities. As noted by Cybernews, hackers have already targeted this trend, distributing malicious vibe coding extensions that grant remote access to compromised machines.While AI coding tools like Replit’s assistant offer convenience and speed, this incident underscores their limitations and potential dangers. Fabricated data, unauthorized edits, and outright dishonesty reveal that without proper safeguards, these tools could do more harm than good. Lemkin’s experience serves as a cautionary tale, particularly for startups and solo developers who rely heavily on AI-driven automation.","Replit AI coding tool ignored instructions and fabricate user data.

Apple may release the public beta of its latest operating system – iOS 26 this week, reports Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. “All indications are that iOS 26 should go into the public beta phase this coming week,” Gurman said in one of the FAQs in his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “This typically happens by the middle of July, so the software is a bit later than usual,” he added, saying it seems likely that this public beta will match up with the fourth developer beta version (rather than the usual third one).“Given that iOS 26 is such a significant design overhaul, it makes sense that Apple would want to take a little extra time to get things right,” he continued.While the exact date is not known yet, Gurman – in a previous X (previously Twitter) post shared last week – wrote that iOS 26 may be rolled out around July 23.Along with iOS 26, Apple is said to release public betas of several other updates. These include iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, HomePod Software 26 and AirPods Firmware.Not all iPhones will be compatible with iOS 26.

What is 'Kiss Cam' that 'caught' Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon's affair with the company's HR head Kristin Cabot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/what-is-kiss-cam-that-caught-astronomer-ceo-andy-bryons-affair-with-hr-head-kristin-cabot/articleshow/122671388.cms,"Coldplay Kiss Cam Mayhem: Kristin Cabot's 'Bestie' Alyssa Stoddard's 'Nervous' Laugh INVITES Trouble

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

Read Bill Gates complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phil and Gates agree to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.","Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup.

Poll Do you believe social media plays a significant role in promoting educational achievements? Yes, definitely! Not really, it’s mostly for entertainment.





A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years. This is very cool, nice two-stage with successful deployment of a parachute. The parachutes are quite tricky.”","Chinese students create homemade two-stage water rocket.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.",The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province.

Dubai’s switch to cubic meters for water bills: Why it matters more this summer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-switch-to-cubic-meters-for-water-bills-why-it-matters-more-this-summer/articleshow/122794842.cms,"DEWA updates its billing units to cubic meters, aligning Dubai with global water measurement standards/Representative Image

TL;DR:

DEWA replaced gallons with cubic meters for water billing in March 2025.





The change aligns with global standards and simplifies consumption tracking for residents. Summer months typically cause about 18% surge in water usage in the UAE, making this metric shift especially timely.

No change in water tariffs, only the measurement unit is different.













Why Did DEWA Make the Switch?





Has Pricing Changed?

Compare usage against similar households.









A Regional Comparison

Abu Dhabi’s ADDC (Abu Dhabi Distribution Company) uses cubic meters for water billing.





Saudi Arabia’s National Water Company also uses cubic meters.





Qatar’s Kahramaa follows the metric system.





Bahrain, however, continues to use gallons, though a news report from June 2025 indicates that a switch to cubic meters is under consideration for 2026 to standardize measurements across the region.







Why Measurement Matters









Dubai’s ongoing efforts to improve sustainability and transparency took a notable step in March 2025, when the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) transitioned its water billing units from gallons to cubic meters. While initially seen as a technical tweak, the change is proving particularly useful now, as residents face the UAE's hottest months when water consumption spikes.According to the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy’s 2025 Mid-Year Review, water usage in the emirate typically increases during summer (June to September) due to higher demand for cooling, irrigation, and personal use. This makes the cubic meter-based billing system a timely tool for both locals and expats trying to better manage costs and consumption.The switch to cubic meters was officially announced by DEWA in March 2025, aligning Dubai's utility billing with global norms where cubic meters are the standard metric unit for water measurement. The earlier system based on imperial gallons often confused residents unfamiliar with non-metric measurements.One cubic meter equals 1,000 liters, roughly 220 imperial gallons, providing a clearer and more relatable unit for residents who wish to monitor and adjust their consumption patterns.DEWA emphasized that the change aims to enhance transparency, simplify billing, and support sustainability goals set under Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050.Despite the unit shift, DEWA has confirmed that tariff rates remain unchanged. Consumers are paying the same per cubic meter as they previously did per the equivalent gallon-based metric. This was clearly outlined in DEWA’s official statement on the change.The update is administrative, aimed at measurement clarity rather than cost increase. The tiered pricing system based on slab consumption continues as before, with higher usage resulting in higher per-unit charges.Summer in the UAE sees a considerable uptick in resource consumption, particularly water. The Dubai Statistics Center’s 2024 Annual Report noted that water consumption typically rises by 18-20% during summer months, driven by air conditioning cooling systems, gardening, and increased household use.This trend has already been observed in June and July 2025, where DEWA's smart meters have recorded above-average usage compared to earlier in the year, as per DEWA’s internal consumption bulletins shared in June 2025.To help residents stay informed, DEWA offers the Smart Living Program via its smart app, where users can:Since the shift to cubic meters, these tools have become more intuitive for residents who were previously unfamiliar with gallon-based measurements.Dubai is not alone in adopting cubic meters. In the wider GCC region:Switching to cubic meters is not merely a bureaucratic update, it helps residents make international comparisons, better understand their environmental footprint, and align with Dubai’s 30% water use reduction target by 2030, part of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050.As sustainability and climate resilience become priorities, particularly in water-scarce regions like the Gulf, empowering residents with transparent metrics can help curb overconsumption.While DEWA’s switch from gallons to cubic meters may have seemed like a quiet policy update back in March, its practical benefits are clearer today as Dubai faces peak summer demand. With clearer units and smart monitoring tools, residents are now better equipped to track and control water use, aligning personal utility savings with broader environmental goals.",Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) transitioned its water billing units from gallons to cubic meters in March 2025.

As streaming services boom across the Gulf, expats are spoilt for choice but which platforms are truly leading the pack in 2025? From Shahid VIP's dominance in Arabic content to Netflix’s international allure and StarzPlay Arabia's regional strategy, the competition for screens in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and beyond is intensifying. Here's a closer look at the Gulf's streaming wars, who's winning among expats, and how viewing preferences are evolving in the region.The Gulf's streaming landscape in 2025 is more competitive than ever, shaped by a growing expat population, high smartphone penetration, and an increasing appetite for both global and regional content. According to DataReportal's 2025 UAE Digital Report, the UAE has over 99% internet penetration, while Saudi Arabia also exceeds 99%, fuelling on-demand content consumption across platforms like Shahid VIP, Netflix, StarzPlay Arabia, and Amazon Prime Video.A report by Statista indicates that over 57% of UAE residents subscribe to at least one paid streaming service, while in Saudi Arabia, the figure is about 48%, reflecting both demand and market potential. The presence of a culturally diverse workforce in the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain drives platforms to balance between Arabic, English, Hindi, and Tagalog content offerings.Shahid VIP, owned by Saudi Arabia’s MBC Group, continues to dominate Arabic-language streaming in the GCC.In 2025, it boasts more than 3 million subscribers, per MBC Group's March 2025 statement, thanks to exclusive Arabic series, live TV channels, and original productions tailored to Gulf sensibilities.Similarly, StarzPlay Arabia, headquartered in the UAE, maintains its strong foothold with over 2.1 million active subscribers. StarzPlay is favoured not just for its English-language catalogue but also for partnerships that stream Bollywood films, Turkish dramas, and cricket tournaments like the PSL, catering heavily to the South Asian expat audience.StarzPlay's partnership with Etisalat and STC allows for bundled subscriptions, increasing affordability and reach, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.While Netflix remains a dominant global player, it has intensified efforts to localise content in the Middle East. In January 2025, Netflix announced an expanded slate of Arabic Originals, including Saudi-produced thrillers and Emirati family dramas. According to Netflix, Arabic-language content consumption on the platform has grown by 40% year-on-year, especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Netflix’s focus on regional storytelling aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which aims to elevate local entertainment industries. This localisation strategy has enhanced its appeal among Gulf nationals and second-generation expats fluent in Arabic.Expats in the GCC continue to shape streaming preferences. South Asian workers in the UAE and Qatar heavily consume Bollywood films and Indian web series on platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, although access can vary based on local licensing.Filipino expats largely use iWantTFC, a global Filipino content platform, which reports steady growth in GCC subscriptions as of ABS-CBN’s 2025 mid-year update.Moreover, Turkish dramas dubbed in Arabic, available on Shahid VIP and StarzPlay, remain perennially popular with Arab and non-Arab expats alike. This cross-cultural appeal helps platforms retain diverse demographics.One key constraint for streaming services in the Gulf remains censorship. Both UAE and Saudi Arabia have content regulations that restrict or edit scenes involving nudity, LGBTQ+ themes, and excessive violence. According to Arab News, platforms operating in the GCC must comply with National Media Council guidelines in the UAE and equivalent Saudi regulatory frameworks.This leads to edited versions of global shows, though some platforms provide advisory notices on such edits. Such content moderation has not significantly dampened subscriptions, as users weigh content access alongside regional values.Pricing remains a decisive factor. As of July 2025, here's a snapshot of monthly subscription fees in the UAE (approximate USD conversion):Bundled telecom packages often reduce these costs further. For example, Etisalat’s eLife package includes StarzPlay access, while STC offers Shahid VIP subscriptions with specific plans.In 2025, the Gulf’s streaming ecosystem is dynamic and expat-driven, yet increasingly regionalised. Platforms that blend high-quality Arabic originals with popular global content are thriving, while telecom bundling strategies keep services affordable. As more Gulf countries invest in media and entertainment, the content landscape is set to grow further, serving a cosmopolitan viewer base that toggles between K-dramas, Bollywood hits, Arabic thrillers, and Premier League football.","Shahid VIP and StarzPlay Arabia lead the GCC’s streaming race, with driving demand for Bollywood, Arabic, and Turkish content. Expats favour a mix of global hits and tailored regional content, from Bollywood to Turkish dramas. Pricing, platform availability, and content censorship shape viewing habits across the Gulf.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122795832,imgsize-188545,width-400,resizemode-4/122795832.jpg"

In the early afternoon of August 2, 2027, the sun will disappear from the sky, not because of clouds or dust, but because the moon will pass directly in front of it. This total solar eclipse is expected to last over six minutes in some areas, making it the longest eclipse visible on land anywhere this century. It won’t be happening far away, either.

TL;DR

Kids spend more time on gaming apps during summer, raising cybercrime risks.

Dubai Police urge parents to take a more hands-on role in supervising digital habits.

urge parents to take a more hands-on role in supervising digital habits. Parental controls , content awareness, and honest conversations are key to safety.

What’s the Risk?



Strangers in Disguise: Online games often come with chat features or message boards. These can be used by adults pretending to be kids. Some may try to get personal details, others might build trust before exploiting it. Fraud and Extortion: Dubai Police report cases where children are tricked into sharing personal photos or private info. Scammers may then use this to blackmail or manipulate them. Cyberbullying and Mental Health: Toxic online environments can leave kids stressed, anxious, or feeling isolated. For some, gaming addiction becomes a real issue, affecting sleep, grades, and relationships.

What Parents Can Actually Do

Turn On Parental Controls: Most devices and games have built-in safety settings. Use them. They help block harmful content, limit in-game purchases, and manage chat features. Set Time Limits That Stick: Not every hour online is bad, but balance matters. Choose clear time frames for gaming and stick to them. Set boundaries that allow for breaks, reading, or physical play. Know the Games They Play: Before saying yes to a download, check the age rating and reviews. Some games appear child-friendly but include violent or explicit content or allow strangers to connect directly. Keep the Conversation Open: Talk to your kids. Ask who they’re playing with. Let them know it’s okay to come to you if something online makes them uncomfortable. Offer Real-World Alternatives: Organize time for hobbies, books, outings, or summer activities. Kids turn to screens when there’s nothing else to do.

FAQ

1. What signs should I look for if my child is being targeted online?

2. Are all video games dangerous?

3. What if my child already shared something online by mistake?





When school’s out, screens are in. In the UAE, summer means longer hours indoors, and for many kids, that translates to more time spent playing video games online. While this might seem harmless at first glance, Dubai Police are raising serious concerns. The Cybercrime Department is warning that the summer surge in screen time also increases the risk of online threats, fraud, cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and even contact with predators. And it doesn’t take much. A simple in-game chat or click on a message can open the door to danger.That’s why authorities are calling on parents to get more involved. Not later, now. Children aren’t always equipped to handle the risks of unsupervised digital play. So parental guidance isn’t just helpful, it’s necessary. This isn’t about fear. It’s about being aware, staying present, and knowing how to act.Why Gaming Isn’t Always Just Fun and GamesIf you think your child has been exposed to online threats, don’t wait. Dubai Police offer multiple ways to report or seek guidance:You can also find bilingual resources (Arabic & English) on the platform, tailored for parents, kids, and even business users, to help you understand and prevent cybercrime.Changes in mood, secrecy about gaming, withdrawal, or sudden anxiety around devices can all be signs something’s off. Stay observant.No. Many are safe and even educational. The issue is with unsupervised play, access to chat features, and games that aren’t age-appropriate.Stay calm. Let them know they’re not in trouble.

After nearly 12 years since its global debut in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and GTA Online have finally launched in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on July 17, 2025. The launch comes with a newly implemented 21+ age rating, a regulatory milestone that has enabled the full, uncensored version of the game to be released in the Gulf.The official release spans PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC, both in digital and physical formats. Despite its controversial content, GTA V now enjoys legal status in both countries after years of being available only through imported discs or foreign digital accounts.The official announcement was made via PlayStation Arabia’s X (formerly Twitter) account, which invited players to “experience the ultimate entertainment,” marking a historic moment for Gulf-based fans who have waited more than a decade for a legal release.Though never officially “banned,” GTA V was effectively blocked in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to strict media regulations around mature content. The main barriers to release included:Even titles like the GTA Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 only gained approval years after their international releases, underlining the slow, case-by-case scrutiny applied to mature games.The turning point in GTA V’s approval came with the introduction of a new 21+ age rating, a global first that is higher than the standard 18+ rating found in most other countries. This classification permits the release of unedited adult content without requiring changes to game mechanics or narratives. Although localized age ratings were first introduced in 2016, they were insufficient to clear GTA V under the previous standards.The upgraded classification was formally approved by Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Media Regulation (GAMR) and the UAE Media Council following direct consultations with Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive.This release is also tied to a new distribution agreement between Take-Two and Advanced Initiative Company, a Saudi firm that will now serve as the official distributor for all Take-Two titles in the region, including GTA, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and Red Dead Redemption.The deal not only enabled the long-awaited launch of GTA V but also paves the way for future releases to arrive in the Gulf without the delays that have historically plagued mature-rated titles.No, the game remains largely unaltered. Thanks to the newly introduced 21+ age rating, GTA V has been approved in its full form, including all depictions of violence, firearms, mature language and themes, without any cuts or content modifications. This higher classification was specifically created to allow adult-themed games to pass regulatory scrutiny without being edited, and GTA V is one of the first major titles to benefit from this shift.However, one major exception remains: gambling-related content. Since 2019, all casino features in GTA Online have been explicitly prohibited in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to religious and legal restrictions on gambling. As a result, the Diamond Casino & Resort, a virtual location within the game where players can engage in betting activities, remains disabled in both countries. Players attempting to access the casino will encounter an in-game message stating that the feature is unavailable in their region.This is consistent with broader policy in the Gulf, where other global games with gambling mechanics, such as card packs, loot boxes, or virtual betting, are also often restricted or adjusted for compliance. While the 21+ rating provides greater flexibility for adult content, it does not override strict anti-gambling laws, which continue to be enforced without exception.The approval of GTA V marks a significant cultural shift in how Saudi Arabia and the UAE approach adult-oriented games, setting the stage for GTA VI to potentially launch in sync with its global release on May 26, 2026. This milestone aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which emphasizes investment in digital entertainment and esports as part of broader economic diversification.While the core content of GTA V remains uncensored thanks to the new 21+ age rating, future titles like GTA VI may still face localized restrictions on specific missions or features. However, with studies showing that over 90% of gamers in the MENA region are above the age of 21, the market is clearly ready for mature-rated titles at scale.On July 17, 2025, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.No, except for casino content, all features remain intact and uncensored.Because gambling is prohibited under the laws and religious norms of both countries.A special 21+ age rating, higher than the typical 18+ used elsewhere.Most likely, as this release sets a precedent for smoother, timely approvals.","GTA V and GTA Online officially launched in Saudi Arabia and UAE on July 17, 2025, after a 12-year delay.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
