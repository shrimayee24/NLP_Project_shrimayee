What are new features of Amrit Bharat trains?

Get ready for new Amrit Bharat Express trains! Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently announced nine new Amrit Bharat Express trains, expanding the network of long-distance passenger services across the country. The upcoming trains will connect West Bengal and Assam with Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, strengthening inter-state rail links.Since the launch of the Amrit Bharat Express in December 2023, 30 services have already become operational, with the network set to grow further with the addition of these new routes.Introduced as a special offering of the Amrit Kaal, the Amrit Bharat Express trains are designed to provide non-air-conditioned long-distance sleeper-class travel at affordable fares.“The new Amrit Bharat trains mark a significant step in improving passenger comfort and connectivity. Other benefits include boosting commerce and tourism!” PM Modi said in a post on X.Ticket prices are around Rs 500 per 1,000 kilometres, with proportionately lower fares for short- and medium-distance journeys. The services aim to connect regions often separated by geography and opportunity.The trains feature modern passenger facilities, including foldable snack tables, mobile phone and bottle holders, radium floor strips, comfortable seating and berths, modern toilets with electro-pneumatic flushing, fire-suppression mechanisms, provisions for divyangjan passengers, fast charging points, pantry cars and provisions for “divyangjan” (differently-abled) passengers.Amrit Bharat Express is a push–pull train featuring non-AC coaches, comprising a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches. Equipped with push–pull technology, the train offers faster acceleration and deceleration and can run at a maximum speed of 130 kmph. In the coming months, Indian Railways is also expected to roll out Amrit Bharat 3.0, which will include AC coaches.","Amrit Bharat Express is a push–pull train featuring non-AC coaches, comprising a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches.

Vande Bharat Sleeper: What Are The Top Features?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the first Vande Bharat sleeper train set of Indian Railways from Malda town in West Bengal today. The inaugural Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Howrah in West Bengal and Kamakya (Guwahati) in Assam.The all air-conditioned train aims to make overnight train journeys faster and more premium and comfortable for passengers. The Vande Bharat Sleeper train has 16 air-conditioned coaches, including 11 AC-3 tier coaches, four AC-2 tier coaches and a single First AC coach, with an overall passenger carrying capacity of 823.Train number 27575 Howrah-Kamakhya (Guwahati) Vande Bharat sleeper will leave at 18:20 from Howrah to arrive in Kamakhya the next day at 8:20 AM. The train will complete the journey in just 14 hours, making it the fastest train on the route.En route the it will stop at Bandel Jn, Nabadwip Dham, Katwa Jn, Azimganj, New Farakka Jn, Malda Town, Aluabari Road, New Jalpaiguri, Jalpaiguri Road, New Cooch Behar, New Alipurduar, New Bongaigaon, and Rangiya. At most of these destinations the train will stop for 2 minutes, except New Jalpaiguri (10 minutes), Malda Town (10 minutes), Azim Ganj (5 minutes).In the return direction, train number 27576 Howrah-Kamakhya Vande Bharat sleeper train will depart from Howrah station at 6:15 PM to arrive in Kamakhya at 8:15 AM.The train will run on six days in a week; Ex Kamakhya won’t run on Wednesday and Ex-Howrah won’t run on Thursdays.For passengers travelling from Howrah to Kamakhya (Guwahati), the AC-3 tier train ticket will be priced at Rs 2,299. This is exclusive of the 5% GST. Fares to New Jalpaiguri and Malda Town will be Rs 1,334 and Rs 960, respectively.In the AC-2 tier category, the Howrah–Guwahati fare has been fixed at Rs 2,970, with tickets costing Rs 1,724 for New Jalpaiguri and Rs 1,240 for Malda Town.First AC fares from Howrah to Guwahati have been set at Rs 3,640, while travel to New Jalpaiguri will cost Rs 2,113 and journeys to Malda Town Rs 1,520.On the Kamakhya side, fares between Kamakhya and Malda Town have been set at Rs 1,522 for AC-3 tier, Rs 1,965 for AC-2 tier and Rs 2,409 for First AC, while tickets between Kamakhya and New Jalpaiguri will be priced at Rs 962 in AC-3 tier, Rs 1,243 in AC-2 tier and Rs 1,524 in First AC.Vande Bharat sleeper trains have been designed for a top speed of 180 kmph and have been tested successfully at that speed. The maximum permissible speed of the train is 160 kmph, though this will vary depending on the route.Safety and efficiency are addressed through the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system, while regenerative braking technology will be deployed to improve energy efficiency, in line with existing Vande Bharat chair car trains.The sleeper coaches are equipped with well-padded berths to enhance comfort, along with improved access to upper berths to make movement easier for passengers.Onboard facilities include gentle night-time lighting, integrated passenger information systems, CCTV monitoring and modular pantry units.The trains also feature aircraft-style bio-vacuum toilets, including specially designed amenities for persons with disabilities, baby care facilities and hot-water shower units in the first-class coach.Additional enhancements include sealed gangways and automatic doors between coaches to help regulate air quality and cabin temperature, as well as individual reading lamps, charging points, foldable snack tables and interiors finished with GFRP panels.Automatic door operation at designated stations, a centralised coach monitoring system and emergency communication features that enable passengers to directly reach the locomotive pilot further strengthen safety and convenience.Its aerodynamic profile helps reduce air resistance, resulting in a steady and smooth ride even at higher speeds.Passengers travelling on the Vande Bharat Sleeper will be served cuisine that reflects local flavours.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work, the report said.The push comes at a pivotal moment for software engineering. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that AI now writes over 30% of new code at the company, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his firm's code. Yet a METR study from July found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. The gap between hype and reality suggests Huang's vision of code-free engineers may be further out than his enthusiasm implies.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, the Nvidia CEO is betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen Huang, CEO of $3 trillion chipmaker Nvidia, wants engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

xAI and Grok are ‘public nuisance’





Ashley St Clair, American writer and mother of Elon Musk’s son Romulus has sued the tech billionaire’s AI company xAI. In the lawsuit filed with the supreme court of the state of New York, Clair alleges that her explicit images were generated by AI chatbot Grok, including one in which she was underage. She further claims that the AI tool, integrated into X (formerly Twitter) – also owned by Elon Musk – promised to stop generating explicit images but continued to do so. Clair is seeking both punitive and compensatory damages from the company.The lawsuit comes days after the tech billionaire said that he will seek full custody of his one-year-old son with Clair. Responding to a user urging him for full custody, Musk wrote on X “I will be filing for full custody today, given her statements implying she might transition a one-year-old boy.”The lawsuit states that the social media company “retaliated against her, demonetising her X account and generating multitudes more images of her, including unlawful images of her in sex positions, covered in semen, virtually nude, and images of her as a child naked”.The filing further alleges that not only were the generated images nonconsensual, but “Grok and xAI also had explicit knowledge that St Clair was not consenting to the creation or dissemination of these images because of her requests for removal”.Ashley St Clair is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer. In a statement to the Guardian, Goldberg said:“xAI is not a reasonably safe product and is a public nuisance. Nobody has born the brunt more than Ashley St Clair. Ashley filed suit because Grok was harassing her by creating and distributing nonconsensual, abusive, and degrading images of her and publishing them on X.“This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm. We intend to hold Grok accountable and to help establish clear legal boundaries for the entire public’s benefit to prevent AI from being weaponised for abuse.”",Ashley St Clair is the mother of Elon Musk's one-year-old son Romulus.

We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.

We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.

Updates to [@]Grok Account

We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.

This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.

Additionally, image creation and the ability to edit images via the Grok account on the X platform are now only available to paid subscribers. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable.

Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new reporting structure reveals friction between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, his $14 billion hire. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement suffocating, while staff question his leadership of Meta's AI ambitions. A recent restructuring centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, indicating Zuckerberg's desire for tighter control over the company's significant AI investments.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr Wang, Meta's highest-paid employee, finds Mark Zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Lessons from tragic incidents abroad

How the public can help prevent harm









A growing wave of dangerous social media challenges is raising alarm in Dubai, with police warning that what appears online as entertainment or a trend can quickly turn into a life-threatening act. Authorities say children and teenagers are being drawn into risky behaviours that have already caused serious injuries and deaths in other countries.Dubai Police have issued a strong warning to parents, teenagers, and young people about the spread of so-called deadly challenges on social media platforms. These challenges are often packaged as viral trends and shared widely online, making them appealing to curious and impressionable users.The activities involved are extremely dangerous. They include skull breaking, choking, breath holding, and other reckless practices that put participants at risk of severe injury or death. Police stressed that while these challenges may appear harmless or exciting on screen, the real-world consequences can be devastating.In a short video clip released on Friday, Dubai Police explained that such trends often attract teenagers who are seeking excitement or online attention.Many take part without fully understanding the serious physical risks involved or the possibility that a single mistake could have fatal outcomes.Authorities pointed out that similar social media challenges in other countries have already led to critical injuries and fatalities. These incidents serve as a stark reminder that online content does not reflect the full danger of what is being promoted, and that copying such behaviour can have irreversible consequences.Dubai Police emphasised that the loss of life and serious harm linked to these challenges elsewhere highlights the urgent need for awareness and early intervention at home and within the community.Dubai Police underlined that parents and guardians play a vital role in protecting children from these online threats. Families are urged to raise awareness and closely monitor their children’s online activity, especially on platforms where viral trends spread quickly.Police encouraged parents to speak openly with their children about the dangers of imitating harmful content shared on social media. Honest conversations can help young people understand the risks and resist peer pressure or the desire for online popularity that often drives participation in such challenges.Beyond family involvement, Dubai Police called on the wider community to report any dangerous or inappropriate behaviour linked to these challenges. Members of the public can report concerns by calling the Dubai Police Contact Centre on 901 or through the ‘Police Eye’ service available on the Dubai Police smart application.Authorities stressed that timely reporting can help prevent injuries and save lives, reinforcing that online trends should never come at the cost of a child’s safety or future.","Dubai Police have issued a strong warning to parents, teenagers, and young people about the spread of so-called deadly challenges on social media platforms.

When and where will the Aerial Parade take place?



Abu Dhabi Corniche: This is the starting hub. The wide boardwalk offers plenty of space for families to set up chairs early.

Dubai’s Kite Beach & JBR: These are the ""action zones."" The fighter jets typically perform low-level passes here, making for a thunderous and thrilling experience.

Al Qawasim Corniche (RAK): Known for its long pedestrian walkway, this spot offers an unobstructed 180-degree view of the sky as the parade heads toward the mountains.

Umbrella Beach (Fujairah): As the final stop, the lighting over the Gulf of Oman during the late afternoon (around 5:00 PM) provides a stunning golden-hour backdrop for the jets.

The UAE is about to witness one of its most ambitious aerial displays yet. On Saturday, January 17, 2026, the ""Day of Solidarity"" parade will see the nation's elite pilots traverse every single emirate. If you’re planning to catch the Al Fursan (The Knights) and their signature colorful smoke trails, timing and location are everything. Here is your definitive guide to making sure you don't miss a second of the action.The parade is designed to flow along the UAE’s coastline, moving from the capital through to the northern and eastern emirates. The Ministry of Defence has organized the display into two distinct segments: a two-hour helicopter display followed by a high-speed 34-minute fighter jet finale.While the aircraft move quickly, the following window is when you should have your cameras ready at the designated ""Flagpole"" or Corniche areas of each emirate:Best viewing spotsTo get the most ""Instagrammable"" shot of the national colors (red, green, white, and black) stretching across the horizon, you want to be as close to the water as possible.The aerial parade will include a mix of helicopters and military jets, flying in coordinated formations.Some aircraft may produce coloured smoke trails, depending on visibility and weather conditions.The display highlights:The UAE Armed Forces have emphasised that all flights follow strict safety and airspace regulations.While everyone wants a great photo, safety is the top priority for the Ministry of Defence. Authorities have issued a strict No-Drone Zone advisory for the duration of the parade. Private drones can interfere with the flight paths of the military jets and helicopters, so leave your tech at home and rely on your smartphone zoom instead.Additionally, traffic near the corniche areas in Sharjah and Dubai is expected to peak about 30 minutes before the flypast. To avoid missing the show while stuck in a parking lot, aim to arrive at your chosen spot at least one hour early.

What is the Multiple-Trip Exit Permit ?

How to Apply

Log in to the “Ashal” portal for companies and manpower services or use the “Sahel Business/Individuals” app.

Select the type of permit: single-trip or multiple-trip.

Enter the start and end dates for the permit.

Submit the request. The system immediately provides a transaction number and shows the application status.

For employers granting pre-approval: go to pre-approval management, search for registered workers, select the required individuals, and click “add” to finalize.

Why it matters





Kuwait has launched a new digital exit permit system that lets a single permit cover multiple trips abroad. The initiative aims to simplify travel procedures, reduce paperwork, and save time for both employees and employers.The Multiple-Trip Exit Permit is a new service launched by the Public Authority for Manpower (PAM) as part of Kuwait’s ongoing digital transformation of government services. Previously, workers needed a separate permit for each trip abroad, requiring repeated applications, approvals, and paperwork.With the upgraded system, a single permit can cover multiple journeys within a specified period. This change streamlines travel for employees and reduces administrative tasks for employers. The service is fully digital and electronically linked with the Ministry of Interior, so once a permit is approved, the information is automatically transmitted to the relevant authorities. Employers and workers can also print the approved permit at any time, offering flexibility and convenience.The system also allows employers to grant automatic pre-approval for exit permits. Pre-approval can be applied to a single worker, a selected group, or all workers under a specific license.There is also an exception option, enabling employers to exclude certain individuals while granting pre-approval to everyone else. Employers retain complete control and can modify, suspend, or cancel pre-approvals at any time.Applying for the Multiple-Trip Exit Permit is simple and fully digital. The steps are:The new exit permit system is part of PAM’s broader efforts to modernize labour services and enhance digital government solutions. By allowing a single permit to cover multiple trips, the system reduces repeated paperwork for both employers and workers and speeds up approvals, making service delivery faster and more efficient. It also gives employers greater flexibility and control over their workforce, while supporting Kuwait’s ongoing digital transformation initiatives. Overall, the upgrade ensures smoother workflows, faster processing, and a more streamlined experience, making worker travel simpler and more predictable.","Kuwait introduced a digital multiple-trip exit permit allowing workers repeated travel with one approval, reducing paperwork.

How the UAE built the World’s leading Arabic AI Model: Falcon-H1 Arabic explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-the-uae-built-the-worlds-leading-arabic-ai-model-falcon-h1-arabic-explained/articleshow/126541445.cms,"UAE’s homegrown Falcon-H1 Arabic AI model shatters global benchmarks / AI Generated Image

What is the UAE’s Falcon-H1 Arabic model?

The 3B model reportedly outperforms Microsoft’s Phi-4 Mini on Arabic-language tasks.

The 7B version ranks among the strongest mid-size Arabic models currently available.

The 34B model has demonstrated higher accuracy than larger competitors on tests covering reasoning, comprehension, dialect recognition, and linguistic depth.

Built Arabic-first, not adapted later

Practical implications

Legal and medical analysis: With a reported 256,000-token context window, the model can process lengthy documents such as contracts or extensive medical records without losing earlier context.

Education: Arabic-language tutoring systems could benefit from stronger alignment with local curricula and language usage

Government and customer services: Automated systems may deliver more accurate responses in Arabic, including regional dialects, for routine public services.

UAE’s broader AI strategy





In a move that has drawn global attention across technology circles, Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has launched Falcon-H1 Arabic, a new Arabic-focused large language model. While not positioned as a general-purpose global AI, the model is being presented as a significant step forward for Arabic-language artificial intelligence.The flagship 34-billion-parameter version has reportedly secured the top position on the Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard (OALL), outperforming several larger international models in Arabic-specific benchmarks. According to published results, Falcon-H1 (34B) exceeded the performance of models such as Meta’s Llama-3.3 (70B) and Alibaba’s Qwen2.5 (72B) on tasks measuring Arabic comprehension, reasoning, and dialect handling.In AI development, parameter count is often associated with stronger performance. However, Falcon-H1’s results suggest that model architecture and language-specific training can play a decisive role, potentially allowing smaller models to compete with larger systems more efficiently.Falcon-H1 Arabic has been released in three sizes, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters, designed to support a range of use cases, from lightweight applications to large institutional deployments.According to benchmark data shared by TII:Researchers note that these results are not solely about benchmark scores, but also about how the model handles long-form context, semantic understanding, and culturally grounded language use, rather than relying on literal translation patterns.Unlike many global AI systems that are primarily trained on English data and later adapted for Arabic, Falcon-H1 was designed with an Arabic-first training approach. It uses a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, which, according to TII, allows the model to better manage Arabic’s complex morphology, sentence structures, and regional variations.The model is reported to perform consistently across Modern Standard Arabic as well as commonly used dialects from different parts of the Arab world. Developers say this enables it to better interpret context, honorifics, idiomatic expressions, and informal speech patterns that often challenge general-purpose models.Beyond language tasks, Falcon-H1 has also shown competitive performance in STEM-related reasoning benchmarks, suggesting broader applicability beyond translation or text generation.For users and organisations, Falcon-H1’s relatively smaller size compared to competing models may offer practical advantages. Because it requires less computational power, it can be deployed at lower cost and with faster response times, making it more accessible for regional businesses and public-sector use.Potential applications include:While large-scale adoption will depend on real-world testing, developers say these capabilities could help close gaps where existing AI tools have struggled with Arabic-language accuracy.The launch of Falcon-H1 Arabic aligns with the UAE’s broader push to develop sovereign AI capabilities, reducing reliance on foreign-developed models that may not fully reflect regional languages or cultural contexts. Industry observers note that such efforts place the UAE among a small group of countries investing heavily in foundational AI infrastructure.Commenting on the launch, H.E. Faisal Al Bannai, Adviser to the UAE President and Secretary-General of ATRC, said Falcon-H1 Arabic reflects the country’s ambition to strengthen its role in responsible AI development. TII CEO Dr. Najwa Aaraj added that the model aims to address gaps where existing systems fall short for Arabic-speaking communities.Rather than positioning Falcon-H1 as a replacement for global AI systems, officials describe it as a specialised model designed to complement them, offering improved performance in Arabic-language and region-specific use cases.","UAE’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has launched Falcon-H1 Arabic, a new Arabic-focused large language model.

Trump's Troops To 'STORM Iran In 24 Hours': SAUDI On Alert, QATAR Confirms Drawdown At US AIR BASE





Property owners across Kuwait will be notified instantly when a lease linked to their property is registered, as the Public Authority for Civil Information has launched a new digital service aimed at tightening oversight and protecting ownership rights.The Public Authority for Civil Information announced the launch of its new “Residence Notification” service through the unified government application Sahel, marking another step in Kuwait’s push toward integrated digital government services. The service allows property owners to receive immediate alerts whenever a new rental contract is registered against their property, giving them real-time visibility into tenancy records and residency registrations.According to PACI, the service is designed to help owners verify whether a lease registration is legitimate, accurate, and authorized. If a property owner receives a notification for a contract they did not approve or recognize, they can take prompt action to address the issue.In such cases, owners are able to cancel the associated residency directly through the Sahel application using the “Cancel Residents” service, which PACI has also referred to as the “Remote Residents” service.As an alternative, property owners may visit PACI’s headquarters in person to complete the required procedures.The authority said the new service enhances monitoring of rental contracts across Kuwait and plays a key role in preventing the misuse of residential addresses. By ensuring that residency information tied to properties is current and accurate, PACI aims to reduce unauthorized registrations and improve the reliability of national civil data.PACI explained that the introduction of the Residence Notification service is part of its broader efforts to digitize public services, improve data accuracy, and strengthen coordination between government entities. Officials noted that the initiative supports the government’s wider strategy to build integrated digital platforms that improve efficiency, transparency, and overall user experience for both citizens and residents.","The Public Authority for Civil Information announced the launch of its new “Residence Notification” service through the unified government application Sahel.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack

How brawl started?





From budget airlines to billionaire banter, a spat over in-flight Wi-Fi quickly turned into a meme-fuelled showdown between Elon Musk and Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary — complete with takeover jokes, name-calling and a cameo by Musk’s AI chatbot.What began as a disagreement over onboard internet snow balled into a public exchange after Ryanair took a swipe at Musk during an outage on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).X reported an outage on Friday, January 16, causing frustration among users who said they could not post or check their feeds. The disruption was tracked by Downdetector, which showed sharp spikes in complaints from regions including the United States and India.During the outage, Ryanair posted: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi, @elonmusk?”Musk responded: “Should I buy Ryanair and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?” The exchange went viral, prompting memes, jokes and speculative replies from other X users.One user tagged Musk’s AI chatbot and asked, “@grok what’s Ryanair’s market cap, how much would it cost for a hostile takeover?” Another followed up with, “@grok who are the top 5 Ryan’s that would be suitable for this job?”Users named Ryan also joined in. One person identifying himself as Ryan wrote, “Make me CEO and I’ll give all Ryan’s a discount.”Another user said he was willing to change his name to become the CEO: “Buy it, put me in charge, my name is Bryan, and we'll paint B's in front of the Ryan. And I'll use grok to fix everything over there and live tweet all of it on X.”A user also said, ""Be careful when you buy them. They’ll offer you a low price that will seem too good to be true, and later down the line they’ll charge you for all kinds of extras.""The exchange followed earlier remarks by O’Leary, who ruled out installing SpaceX ’s Starlink internet in Ryanair’s aircraft. “You need to put antenna on fuselage it comes with a 2% fuel penalty because of the weight and drag,” he told Reuters. “We don't think our passengers are willing to pay for WiFi for an average 1-hour flight.”Speaking on a radio show earlier, O’Leary referred to Musk as an “idiot.”, adding that the Tesla owner is “very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot.”Musk labelled O’Leary an “utter idiot” and said he should be fired. The name-calling continued as both men traded further remarks, Irish Times reported.Musk is the richest man on the globe, with his current net worth exceeding $700 billion a while back. His net worth surpassed the combined wealth of the next three tech billionaires on the list, including Google's Larry Page, Oracle's Larry Ellison, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos.O’Leary was set to receive a $116 million bonus in 2028 for meeting performance targets, but he still commanded a fraction of Musk’s wealth.","Ryanair took a swipe at Musk during an outage on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) The exchange went viral, prompting memes, jokes and speculative replies from other X users.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

Rare Apple devices from different eras

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

What is Dubai's Smart Rental Index?



Why are rent hikes in Dubai regulated in the first place?

Dubai Rent Increases Decoded: What Landlords Don’t Always Tell Tenants

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

15% increase: If it’s 31% to 40% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

What happens if no notice is given?



Dubai Rent Wars: The Legal Trick Every Tenant Needs to Know in 2026

How the system benefits tenants and landlords in Dubai



Know your rights before you renew.

Avoid paying more than the legal maximum.

Have evidence for negotiations and disputes.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

ChatGPT performs better when you're rude to it but researchers warn that there’s a catch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-performs-better-when-youre-rude-to-it-but-researchers-warn-that-theres-a-catch/articleshow/126640618.cms,"A recent study suggests AI chatbots like ChatGPT perform better with rude prompts, achieving higher accuracy. Researchers found demanding language yielded superior results compared to polite requests. However, they caution this could foster harmful communication habits, potentially impacting human interactions. The findings highlight AI's unexpected sensitivity to tone, adding complexity to human-AI engagement.

“Using insulting or demeaning language in

human-AI interaction

could have negative effects on user experience, accessibility, and inclusivity, and may contribute to harmful communication norms,”

AI chatbots are more sensitive to tone than researchers expected: Study

“For the longest of times, we humans have wanted conversational interfaces for interacting with machines. But now we realise that there are drawbacks for such interfaces too, and there is some value in APIs that are structured.”





AI chatbots like ChatGPT respond more accurately when users are rude to them, a new study claims. However, researchers warn that the approach could create harmful communication habits. According to a report by Fortune, researchers at the Pennsylvania State University tested ChatGPT's 4o model on 50 multiple-choice questions, using over 250 prompts ranging from very polite to very rude. They found that “very rude” prompts achieved 84.8% accuracy, which was four percentage points higher than ""very polite"" prompts.The AI was more responsive to bossy language such as ""Hey, gofer, figure this out"" than to polite language such as ""Would you be so kind as to solve the following question?"" At the same time, researchers warned that using rude language with AI could have negative consequences in the long run.the researchers wrote.The study suggests that while a demanding tone might improve ChatGPT's performance in the short term, it could encourage uncivil behaviour that spills over into how people interact with each other.The early-stage study, which other scientists have not yet reviewed, provides new proof that both how sentences are built and the tone used can affect how AI chatbots respond. It may also show that interactions between humans and AI are more complex than experts previously believed.Earlier studies on AI chatbot behaviour have found that chatbots are sensitive to the information humans provide. In one study, University of Pennsylvania researchers tricked AI language models into giving banned responses by using persuasion tricks that work on people.In another study, scientists discovered that AI language models were at risk of ""brain rot,"" a type of lasting mental decline. The models showed higher levels of dangerous personality traits when continuously fed low-quality viral content.The Penn State researchers pointed out some weaknesses in their study, such as the relatively small number of responses tested and the fact that they mostly used just one AI model, ChatGPT 4o.The researchers also said more advanced AI models might ""disregard issues of tone and focus on the essence of each question."" Still, the research adds to the growing curiosity about AI models and their complexity.This is especially important because the study found ChatGPT's answers change based on slight differences in prompts, even when given a supposedly simple format like a multiple-choice test, said one of the researchers, Penn State Information Systems professor Akhil Kumar, who has degrees in both electrical engineering and computer science.In an email to Fortune, Kumar said,","Researchers at the Pennsylvania State University tested ChatGPT's 4o model on 50 multiple-choice questions, using over 250 prompts ranging from very polite to very rude.

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126659211,imgsize-22842,width-400,resizemode-4/tim-cook-image-source-reuters.jpg"

Jason Calacanis names three better options than ChatGPT



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also moved to using Gemini 3







ChatGPT appears to be losing its ‘charm’ as prominent Silicon Valley figures are moving to adopt other AI solutions offered by companies like Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI. One of the biggest American angel investors and entrepreneur, Jason Calacanis, has announced that he has officially cancelled his firm’s $10,000-a-year corporate subscription to OpenAI ’s AI offering.Calacanis cited both performance stagnation and a lack of trust in how the company handles corporate data as the reasons for cancelling the subscription.“Cancelled our corporate OpenAI account today; We were spending ~ $10k a year,” Calacanis said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“ChatGPT isn’t keeping up imo — and I don’t trust them with my corporate data. Long game, but I think ChatGPT is 4th place now,” added Calacanis, who is also an early-stage investor and co-host of the All-In podcast.While calling ChatGPT the forth option, Calacanis says there three AI chatbot models that are better than OpeAI’s offering. He praised xAI for its “real-time data”, Google Gemini for its travel, local information and YouTube integration; and Anthropic’s Claude for its prowess in handling corporate workflows.“xAI is better for real time data, Gemini is better for travel, local YouTube and Claude AI is much better for corporate (Cowork and Project features specifically),” he added.The move comes at a time of peak volatility in the AI sector, as Google’s newly released Gemini 3 has begin to erode OpenAI’s once-impenetrable market share, and Calacanis is not alone in his defection. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a long-time daily user of ChatGPT, also announced a permanent move to Google’s Gemini 3 after a two-hour trial run.Soon after the launch of Gemini 3 last year, Benioff posted on X, “Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back.”He described the leap in reasoning, speed, and multimodal capabilities as “insane”.“The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video... everything is sharper and faster.
