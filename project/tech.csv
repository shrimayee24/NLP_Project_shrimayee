Delhi to launch unified emergency helpline 112 for faster response: CM Gupta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-to-launch-unified-emergency-helpline-112-for-faster-response-cm-gupta/articleshow/126757258.cms,"File photo: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta

NEW DELHI: The residents of Delhi will soon be able to access multiple emergency services by dialling a unified helpline 112 instead of calling multiple numbers.Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, announcing the single emergency number, said the Ministry of Home Affairs declared '112' as the national emergency number and in line with this, Delhi is moving towards its implementation.""Depending on the nature of the emergency, the police, fire services, ambulance and disaster management agencies can be alerted simultaneously by dialling 112,"" Gupta said.""Assistance can be sought not only by phone but also via a mobile app, an emergency button, SMS, and online platforms, ensuring that even if a citizen is unable to speak, they can still send a distress signal with ease,"" Gupta added.Under the unified helpline system, ERSS 2.0 will also feature a modern dashboard in the control room where details like real-time monitoring of where an incident has occurred, which vehicle has been dispatched, and how long it will take to reach the site will be available, she added.ERSS 2.0 is a modern, unified signal-handling system that will receive all emergency calls, mobile app alerts, panic button activations, SMS, and web alerts at a single Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).""As soon as a call or emergency alert is received, the system automatically detects the caller's location, eliminating the need for the victim to explain where they are. Once the location is identified, the nearest police vehicle, ambulance, or fire tender is immediately dispatched from the control room,"" she added.This saves crucial time during the golden hour (the first 60 minutes) and ensures faster assistance. Under the new system, a single call will alert the police, fire, and medical services simultaneously, significantly reducing delays in emergency response, the chief minister said.In case of any delay, an alternative vehicle can be deployed immediately. This ensures continuous oversight and enhances accountability.Gupta added that the entire plan will be implemented in phases. In the first phase, all existing emergency numbers will be integrated into 112. This will be followed by technical upgrades, public awareness campaigns, training of call-takers and, finally, evaluation of the system.","Residents of Delhi will soon be able to access multiple emergency services by dialling a unified helpline 112.

YouTube accused of quietly deleting custom subtitles across the platform,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/youtube-accused-of-quietly-deleting-custom-subtitles-across-the-platform/articleshow/126715300.cms,"Image Via YouTube

YouTube accused of quietly removing custom subtitles used by creators





YouTube has come under criticism from content creators as well as translation teams for pulling down handcrafted subtitles submitted by users without prior notice, as has become apparent in the wake of reported cases about the situation. User-submitted subtitles have been an essential part of helping content creators reach a global audience through accurate translation and optimized viewing experiences, particularly in fast-paced videos, music videos, as well as multilingual live videos on YouTube.The issue has caused concern because YouTube has not made any public announcement explaining the change. While the platform provides auto-generated subtitles in several languages, creators often rely on custom subtitles to avoid errors, mistranslations, and timing problems. For international communities, these subtitles are more than a feature, they are essential for understanding content and staying connected with creators from different regions.According to creators and translators, YouTube is deleting subtitles created using an undocumented format known as SRV3. This format allowed for more detailed timing, styling, and presentation than standard subtitle options. It was commonly used for music videos, lyric syncing, and creative subtitle designs, particularly within VTuber and anime-style content communities.Several users on social media have claimed that subtitles have disappeared from older videos with millions of views, suggesting the issue is not a temporary bug. Some translation managers and production staff have stated that this confirms a planned platform change rather than an error. Because SRV3 was never officially supported, YouTube may be removing it as part of a technical cleanup or policy enforcement.The backlash has escalated as many of these subtitles cannot readily be replaced. The flexibility in the supported subtitle formats cannot be matched by other formats, and it will take time to recreate all this work. Fans will equally be harmed as subtitles assist them in understanding jokes and lyrics in the videos.As of yet, YouTube has not responded to these allegations, nor has the company stated if these removals will continue. This lack of communication has been frustrating for everyone and has led many creators to ask for the ability to save their already existing subtitles.The quiet removal of custom subtitles raised serious concerns about accessibility and creator support on YouTube. While the platform may have technical reasons for having made this change, the complete lack of communication has left creators and viewers confused and disappointed. Until YouTube addresses the issue, many fear that valuable translations and creative subtitle work could be lost permanently, limiting global access to content that once crossed language barriers.","YouTube accused of quietly removing custom subtitles used by creators and translators.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated

A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada, which includes northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, is home to the largest beaver dam ever documented. The structure is located deep within the park, far from roads, towns, and established paths, making it inaccessible by foot. It is so large that it can be seen in satellite photographs from orbit. The dam is approximately 775 metres long at its front edge and spans an area of around 70,000 square metres, keeping back a substantial volume of water. It was initially discovered in 2007 using satellite imaging rather than terrestrial exploration. Further investigation revealed that the dam did not exist before 1980, implying that it was developed over several decades by multiple generations of beavers operating in the same spot.Wood Buffalo National Park spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is Canada's largest national park and among the world's largest protected places. The beaver dam is located deep within it, far from roads, cities, and recognised trails.Walking to the place would take several days. The terrain is challenging and slow. Wetlands extend over large distances. Muskeg collapses under weight.The boreal forest closes in densely. Most people who saw the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived on private sightseeing planes, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","The beaver dam is located in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work, the report said.The push comes at a pivotal moment for software engineering. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that AI now writes over 30% of new code at the company, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his firm's code. Yet a METR study from July found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. The gap between hype and reality suggests Huang's vision of code-free engineers may be further out than his enthusiasm implies.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, the Nvidia CEO is betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen Huang, CEO of $3 trillion chipmaker Nvidia, wants engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr Wang, Meta's highest-paid employee, finds Mark Zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways. As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats. These aggregations are the natural barometers by which environmental health is spotlighted, emphasising those areas where ecosystems are healthy and working.","The sight of hundreds of bald eagles in one place in British Columbia stunned researchers and local communities alike.

Dubai issues warning over illegal parking deals in Discovery Gardens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-issues-warning-over-illegal-parking-deals-in-discovery-gardens/articleshow/126706296.cms,"Discovery Gardens introduces paid parking in Dubai, warns residents against unofficial rentals / Image: file

Official warning

Permit rules and fees

Delays and app challenges





Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles and reducing congestion. This change, effective from January 15, 2026, makes on-street parking a paid service, with licence zone signs now in place across the neighbourhood. Residents must apply for parking permits through the official Parkonic system rather than relying on informal arrangements.Each residential unit in buildings without dedicated parking receives one free permit for a vehicle. Additional cars require a paid subscription, typically Dh945 per month or Dh2,625 quarterly, as part of the effort to ensure fair usage and open up street spaces for legitimate residents.In response to posts on community social media pages offering private parking spaces for rent, Parkonic has cautioned residents against unofficial deals. These offers, circulating on platforms like Facebook, involve tenants advertising outdoor parking spaces in exchange for monthly fees.Parkonic emphasised that all valid parking permits can only be obtained through its official app or authorised channels.Payments and registrations made outside the recognised platforms are not supported, and vehicles using such informal arrangements may face regular visitor parking charges or be considered unauthorised, potentially leading to fines or penalties.This advisory aims to protect residents from possible scams and confusion, and to ensure all parking entitlements remain traceable and enforceable under Dubai community rules.The new parking rules have sparked mixed reactions among tenants across the community. Some argue that the fees for second vehicles are too high, especially for families with more than one car, calling for reductions to Dh500-Dh600 or other concessions to ease the burden.There have also been specific concerns from residents of the Zen Cluster (Pink Buildings), a part of Discovery Gardens where only certain apartments have basement parking. A recent circular clarified that on-street parking is excluded from complimentary permit eligibility if a residential unit already has basement parking access, meaning many studio tenants now face visitor tariffs instead of free permits.Residents in this cluster say the lack of free street permits unfairly penalises them and are pushing for equal treatment with tenants in other parts of the community.The transition hasn’t been without hiccups. Parkonic extended the registration deadline to January 19 after numerous residents reported difficulties using the Parkonic app, such as system errors and inability to activate permits even after receiving PINs.To address these issues, Parkonic pledged that residents will not face fines while technical problems persist and that support teams are working to resolve account and activation challenges. This temporary extension has helped more tenants complete the permit process without penalty.Overall, the introduction of paid and regulated parking in Discovery Gardens represents a broader trend in Dubai to standardise parking across communities and reduce misuse by non-residents or long-term street storage. The system aims to free up spaces, reduce traffic problems and prioritise residents, but it also highlights the need for clear communication and flexibility as lived realities catch up with policy.As implementation continues, resident feedback will likely shape future adjustments, especially around fee levels, eligibility criteria, and enforcement practices.",Dubai’s Discovery Gardens community has introduced a regulated paid parking system aimed at managing the growing number of vehicles.

Abu Dhabi rolls out blood test capable of detecting 50+ cancer types,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-rolls-out-blood-test-capable-of-detecting-50-cancer-types/articleshow/126670898.cms,"Abu Dhabi’s new blood test makes cancer screening as simple as a lab draw / AI Illustration

How do blood tests detect cancer?

The rollout

Age and Risk: The test is primarily aimed at residents aged 40 and above. It is particularly recommended for those with a family history of cancer or those who have missed traditional screenings.



Location: You can access the test at major healthcare hubs, including facilities operated by Ambulatory Healthcare Services (AHS) and the M42 healthcare network. This covers clinics across Abu Dhabi city, Al Ain, and the Al Dhafra region.



Complimentary Use: It is important to note that this test is meant to complement traditional screenings (like papsmears or mammograms), providing an extra layer of security for cancers that don't have standard screening methods.

Cost

Why does this matter?





Abu Dhabi is once again setting a global benchmark in healthcare. The Department of Health (DoH) and the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre (ADPHC) have officially introduced a revolutionary Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) blood test.This isn't just another medical check-up; it is a sophisticated ""liquid biopsy"" that can spot the early biological fingerprints of over 50 different types of cancer from a single tube of blood.For years, the medical world has struggled to screen for ""silent killers"", cancers like those in the pancreas, liver, and brain, which often show no symptoms until it is too late.By identifying fragments of cancer DNA circulating in the bloodstream, this test provides a window into the body's health that traditional scans might miss, catching tumors when they are most treatable.The newly introduced test works by identifying cancer-related biological markers circulating in the blood. Unlike traditional screenings, which usually target one cancer at a time, this test can detect dozens of cancers in a single sample, including types that currently have no standard screening methods, such as pancreatic, gastric and certain brain cancers.From a healthcare-system perspective, this is a major accomplishment.It reduces the need for multiple invasive procedures, lowers patient hesitation around screening, and makes early detection far more accessible. The test requires no fasting, no preparation and no hospital admission, making it suitable for integration into routine health check-ups.Doctors involved in the programme have emphasised that this approach removes many of the psychological and practical barriers that prevent people from getting screened in the first place, a key reason cancers are often detected too late.The Department of Health is rolling out this technology with a specific focus on those who need it most. The service is being integrated into the existing IFHAS program, which is Abu Dhabi's comprehensive health screening initiative for residents.The test is currently priced between AED 7,000 and AED 8,000, reflecting the advanced technology behind it. While not positioned as a mass free screening yet, health experts note that detecting multiple cancers through a single test can be more cost-effective over time than multiple separate investigations and late-stage treatments.More importantly, the rollout sends a strong signal about the future direction of healthcare in the UAE, one that prioritises early intervention, data-driven diagnostics and patient-friendly solutions. As similar technologies continue to evolve globally, Abu Dhabi’s early adoption places it among regions leading the transition toward next-generation preventive medicine.This initiative is not just about a new test, it represents an institutional achievement. Abu Dhabi has demonstrated how advanced science, policy support and healthcare infrastructure can come together to address one of the world’s deadliest diseases more effectively.By making early cancer detection simpler and more accessible, the emirate has taken a decisive step toward saving lives before they reach hospital wards, a true measure of progress in modern healthcare.","Abu Dhabi has introduced a revolutionary blood test for cancer screening.

How does it work?

Shared Rides with Tech-Enabled SUVs: Instead of every family driving separately, students are grouped by neighbourhood and ride in shared, tech-equipped SUVs or buses to and from school.



Smart Routes, Same Targets: Routes are planned using demand data, grouping students headed in similar directions and aligned with school start and finish times.



Optimised Timing: RTA aims to keep ride times under 60 minutes for most trips, which is more predictable than traditional buses or variable car drop-offs.



Managed by Partners: The pilot is being run with Yango Group providing tech and booking systems, and Urban Express Transport operating the vehicles.

The traditional big yellow bus is getting a high-tech makeover. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV. Launched in mid-January 2026, this ""pooled transport"" initiative is designed for students aged 14 and above who attend schools in high-traffic clusters.Instead of a fixed, long-winded bus route that stops at every corner, these high-end vehicles use smart data from Yango Group and Urban Express to pick up students living in the same neighborhood. By grouping children heading to nearby schools into one premium vehicle, the RTA hopes to slash the number of private cars clogging up school gates every morning.Dubai’s pooled system is a shared ride model designed to be efficient, safe and modern:Unlike traditional dedicated school buses that serve only one school, this model is zoned and demand-responsive, similar to ride-hailing, but tailored for students and safety.The initial phase of this ""neighborhood pooling"" is focused on the Al Barsha area, one of Dubai's busiest education hubs. If your child attends one of the following six schools, you are eligible to register for the service:The service isn't just about the ride; it's about the timing.The RTA guarantees that no student will spend more than 60 minutes in the vehicle, and routes are optimized daily to ensure the fastest possible trip from doorstep to classroom. Price of premiumWhile ""luxury SUV"" sounds expensive, the pooling model actually makes it surprisingly affordable. The pilot has launched with a special introductory rate of AED 1,000 per month.Compared to the cost of fuel, the time spent by a parent or driver in traffic, and traditional bus fees, the RTA estimates this model can save families about 15% in costs. Parents get the peace of mind of live vehicle tracking through a dedicated app, and the vehicles are held to the same strict safety standards as regular school buses, including smart monitoring and RTA-certified drivers.The ""SUV for students"" move is part of a larger strategy to get 60% of students into shared transport within the next three years. For the average resident, even those without school-age kids, this is a win. Fewer private cars performing U-turns and double-parking at school gates means a smoother flow for everyone during the 7:30 AM rush.Ahmed Hashem Bahrozyan, CEO of the Public Transport Agency, emphasized that the pilot is a ""step-change"" in how Dubai handles daily mobility. If the Al Barsha trial shows a significant drop in congestion, the RTA plans to expand the SUV and pooled bus service to other major school districts across Dubai by the start of the next school year in September 2026.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially rolled out a pilot program that lets students trade the standard bus seat for a luxury SUV.

Fans are excited about the move, which could bring a mix of music, gaming, and live interactions to Kick throughout the year.The news sheds some light on why Kick has been receiving attention in the online streaming community. Apparently, one important aspect might be its revenue sharing model, which seems to be more attractive than other options. Also, the presence of an in-house army of clippers, facilities to create clips for live streaming, and the convenience offered by Kick to its users to share clips and gain more viewers are some important factors. The news is spreading further through social media posting and TikTok videos, which give an impression that Soulja Boy’s live streaming is expected to receive good responses in the coming months.According to posts shared online, Soulja Boy’s move to Kick is part of the platform’s strategy to attract high-profile talent and compete with larger streaming services.While Kick has not yet officially confirmed the contract, the viral X post and contract screenshots indicate the rapper is serious about streaming full-time this year. Fans have speculated that his presence could revive his gaming and online content profile, offering a mix of live entertainment and interactive sessions that combine his music persona with streaming.This collaboration comes at a time when Kick is experiencing growth in terms of signing many celebrities in the hope of attracting more people who will engage with this platform. This is a good move for Soulja Boy since he will get the chance to perform for his audience in a different way while at the same time enjoying better payment services for content creation.The signing of Soulja Boy with Kick is a landmark event in the career of the rapper as well as the live streaming services provider. The announcement to stream content live in 2026 is part of the rising trend of live streaming by celebrities while also promoting the services provided by Kick in a market where many other services compete in the industry. This partnership between the rapper and the live streaming platform is expected to shape online streaming in 2026.","Rapper and internet personality Soulja Boy has officially signed an exclusive deal with the streaming platform Kick.

How the public can help prevent harm









A growing wave of dangerous social media challenges is raising alarm in Dubai, with police warning that what appears online as entertainment or a trend can quickly turn into a life-threatening act. Authorities say children and teenagers are being drawn into risky behaviours that have already caused serious injuries and deaths in other countries.Dubai Police have issued a strong warning to parents, teenagers, and young people about the spread of so-called deadly challenges on social media platforms. These challenges are often packaged as viral trends and shared widely online, making them appealing to curious and impressionable users.The activities involved are extremely dangerous. They include skull breaking, choking, breath holding, and other reckless practices that put participants at risk of severe injury or death. Police stressed that while these challenges may appear harmless or exciting on screen, the real-world consequences can be devastating.In a short video clip released on Friday, Dubai Police explained that such trends often attract teenagers who are seeking excitement or online attention.Many take part without fully understanding the serious physical risks involved or the possibility that a single mistake could have fatal outcomes.Authorities pointed out that similar social media challenges in other countries have already led to critical injuries and fatalities. These incidents serve as a stark reminder that online content does not reflect the full danger of what is being promoted, and that copying such behaviour can have irreversible consequences.Dubai Police emphasised that the loss of life and serious harm linked to these challenges elsewhere highlights the urgent need for awareness and early intervention at home and within the community.Dubai Police underlined that parents and guardians play a vital role in protecting children from these online threats. Families are urged to raise awareness and closely monitor their children’s online activity, especially on platforms where viral trends spread quickly.Police encouraged parents to speak openly with their children about the dangers of imitating harmful content shared on social media. Honest conversations can help young people understand the risks and resist peer pressure or the desire for online popularity that often drives participation in such challenges.Beyond family involvement, Dubai Police called on the wider community to report any dangerous or inappropriate behaviour linked to these challenges. Members of the public can report concerns by calling the Dubai Police Contact Centre on 901 or through the ‘Police Eye’ service available on the Dubai Police smart application.Authorities stressed that timely reporting can help prevent injuries and save lives, reinforcing that online trends should never come at the cost of a child’s safety or future.","Dubai Police have issued a strong warning to parents, teenagers, and young people about the spread of so-called deadly challenges on social media platforms.

When and where will the Aerial Parade take place?



Abu Dhabi Corniche: This is the starting hub. The wide boardwalk offers plenty of space for families to set up chairs early.

Dubai’s Kite Beach & JBR: These are the ""action zones."" The fighter jets typically perform low-level passes here, making for a thunderous and thrilling experience.

Al Qawasim Corniche (RAK): Known for its long pedestrian walkway, this spot offers an unobstructed 180-degree view of the sky as the parade heads toward the mountains.

Umbrella Beach (Fujairah): As the final stop, the lighting over the Gulf of Oman during the late afternoon (around 5:00 PM) provides a stunning golden-hour backdrop for the jets.

The UAE is about to witness one of its most ambitious aerial displays yet. On Saturday, January 17, 2026, the ""Day of Solidarity"" parade will see the nation's elite pilots traverse every single emirate. If you’re planning to catch the Al Fursan (The Knights) and their signature colorful smoke trails, timing and location are everything. Here is your definitive guide to making sure you don't miss a second of the action.The parade is designed to flow along the UAE’s coastline, moving from the capital through to the northern and eastern emirates. The Ministry of Defence has organized the display into two distinct segments: a two-hour helicopter display followed by a high-speed 34-minute fighter jet finale.While the aircraft move quickly, the following window is when you should have your cameras ready at the designated ""Flagpole"" or Corniche areas of each emirate:Best viewing spotsTo get the most ""Instagrammable"" shot of the national colors (red, green, white, and black) stretching across the horizon, you want to be as close to the water as possible.The aerial parade will include a mix of helicopters and military jets, flying in coordinated formations.Some aircraft may produce coloured smoke trails, depending on visibility and weather conditions.The display highlights:The UAE Armed Forces have emphasised that all flights follow strict safety and airspace regulations.While everyone wants a great photo, safety is the top priority for the Ministry of Defence. Authorities have issued a strict No-Drone Zone advisory for the duration of the parade. Private drones can interfere with the flight paths of the military jets and helicopters, so leave your tech at home and rely on your smartphone zoom instead.Additionally, traffic near the corniche areas in Sharjah and Dubai is expected to peak about 30 minutes before the flypast. To avoid missing the show while stuck in a parking lot, aim to arrive at your chosen spot at least one hour early. Bring a portable power bank, between the video recording and the live-streaming on #DayofSolidarity, your battery will drain faster than the jets fly.This parade isn't just for military buffs; it’s a community event designed to bring people together in open spaces. For the average resident, it’s a rare chance to see the nation's defense technology up close and personal in a celebratory atmosphere. Whether you are a long-term resident or a tourist, standing on the beach as the UAE flag is drawn in the sky above you is a powerful reminder of the nation’s unity and its ""calm strength.

"Did Starmer impose a curfew in the UK? No, it's just a fake TikTok video",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-starmer-impose-a-curfew-in-the-uk-no-its-just-a-fake-tiktok-video/articleshow/126262276.cms,"Keir Starmer

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries. The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric- enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125101750,imgsize-47068,width-400,resizemode-4/life-certificate-2025-step-by-step-guide-to-generate-and-submit-jeevan-pramaan-online-and-offline.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Rule #3: Tell your story with courage



Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

How rent increase limits are calculated in Dubai



0% increase: If your current rent is up to 10% below the market average

5% increase: If it’s 11% to 20% below average

10% increase: If it’s 21% to 30% below average

20% increase: If it’s more than 40% below average

Step-by-step: How to check if your rent increase is legal in Dubai



Visit the official DLD Rent Index page on the Dubai Land Department website. Enter your Title Deed number or manually key in your property details (area, number of rooms, contract expiry date and current annual rent). The tool calculates the average rent for similar properties nearby. It then shows the maximum legal rent increase allowed under the index bands.

What to do if your Dubai landlord demands too much



Present the official index result to the landlord in writing or via email.

Negotiate based on the legal maximum rather than the landlord’s figure.

File a complaint with the Rental Dispute Centre (RDC) at the Dubai Land Department, where the index can be used as statutory evidence to challenge unfair increases.

How the system benefits tenants and landlords in Dubai



Know your rights before you renew.

Avoid paying more than the legal maximum.

Have evidence for negotiations and disputes.

Bottom line: Rent transparency in Dubai







As Dubai’s rental market continues to evolve amid strong demand and population growth, tenants often grapple with rising rents and the question: Is this rent increase even legal ? Fortunately, the Dubai Land Department’s Smart Rental Index, an AI-powered official tool, now gives residents a clear way to check whether a rent hike proposed by a landlord is justified under UAE law.Whether you are renewing your lease, debating negotiations or simply planning your budget, understanding how rent hikes are regulated in Dubai is essential. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how the system works and how tenants can protect themselves from arbitrary increases.At the core of Dubai’s rent regulation framework is the Smart Rental Index, a sophisticated tool developed by the Dubai Land Department (DLD) to determine fair rental values across the emirate. Unlike the older system, which was updated annually by broad district averages, the Smart Index uses AI and detailed building-level data, including construction quality, services, maintenance standards and location, to produce real-time average rent figures for specific buildings and neighbourhoods.The index covers all residential areas of Dubai, including freehold communities and leasehold zones and helps both tenants and landlords benchmark rental rates against current market conditions.Under Dubai’s tenancy laws (including Decree No. 43 of 2013 and subsequent DLD regulations), landlords cannot arbitrarily raise rent each year. Instead, rent increases are permitted only during lease renewal and only if the Smart Rental Index supports the hike.Importantly, landlords must also provide tenants with a written notice at least 90 days before the expiry of the tenancy contract if they wish to raise rent or change any contract terms. Failing to provide this notice makes the increase invalid under the law, even if the index allows it.These rules are designed to promote market transparency and protect tenants from sudden, excessive rent hikes that could destabilise household finances.Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent, based on how the tenant’s current rent compares with the average market rent shown in the Smart Rental Index -These bands help ensure that rent adjustments are fair and reflect genuine market trends rather than landlord discretion. They are automatically applied by the Smart Rental Index tool when you perform a legal rent check.Tenants in Dubai can easily verify whether a proposed rent increase complies with the official rules by using the online rent calculator provided by the Dubai Land Department:You can access this service via the Dubai REST app, the DLD website under e-services or the DubaiNow app, all of which provide the same official data. Once you have the result, you can print or screenshot the official calculation to use in negotiations with your landlord or, if needed, as evidence in a dispute.If your landlord proposes a rent increase that exceeds the legal limit shown by the Smart Rental Index or fails to give the mandatory 90-day notice, you have options:Tenants have successfully used this process to keep their rent at current levels when the index shows no increase is allowed, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness.Even if the Smart Rental Index shows your rent qualifies for an increase, the landlord must still serve at least 90 days’ written notice before your tenancy expires. If they don’t, the increase is invalid by law and your rent must remain unchanged for the next contract period.This dual requirement, both index eligibility and timely notice, protects tenants from both unjustified and procedural rent hikes.The Smart Rental Index is not just a protective tool for tenants, it also helps landlords justify their pricing based on clear market data. This transparency can reduce conflicts and support fairer negotiation at renewal time.For tenants, the benefits are clear:For landlords, it standardises expectations and aligns increases with actual market trends, supporting sustainable rental growth across Dubai’s diverse property landscape.Dubai’s Smart Rental Index and the associated legal framework give tenants a powerful and free way to verify whether a rent increase is fair and lawful. Using the official online calculator and understanding the rules around notice periods and permissible increases allows renters to protect themselves from arbitrary hikes while helping landlords set rents that reflect genuine market data.With rent increases now a standard concern for tenants across the emirate, knowing how to use the Smart Rental Index could save tenants thousands of dirhams and reduce rental disputes. It is not just about checking numbers, it is about ensuring fairness, transparency and legal compliance in one of the world’s most dynamic rental markets.",Dubai’s rent increase system sets strict limits on how much landlords can legally increase rent.

What the company said about the new feature

“Price Trends marks the first step in Cleartrip’s larger pricing intelligence roadmap. We have built it based on a simple idea that ‘transparency creates trust.’ By combining historical data with trend analysis, we are giving travellers a clear, actionable view of pricing, rather than leaving them to speculate.

As we continue to strengthen this, we will also layer in smarter alerts, deeper insights and predictive capabilities powered by AI that proactively help travellers stay ahead of price movements and make the right booking decision at the right time.

”

“We know that for most travellers, the 'book now or wait' dilemma is a huge source of anxiety. With Price Trends, we’re taking the guesswork out of the equation. Instead of forcing people to manually track fares and stress over price jumps, we’re giving them a clear, data-backed signal right on the app. This kind of contextual intelligence significantly improves confidence, making the booking experience feel less like a gamble and more like a well-informed decision.

”





Cleartrip launched a Price Trends service that will allow customers to make informed decisions while booking flights by looking at past prices and trends in prices for flights they want. The Flipkart-owned online travel platform introduced the feature to address the uncertainty travellers face about whether flight prices will rise or fall.
