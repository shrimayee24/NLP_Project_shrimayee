NEW DELHI: Concerned over the growing threat from AI-generated synthetic content and deepfakes, govt is considering amendments to the IT law to fix greater accountability on top social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube and X against potential misinformation and proposed that AI and social media platforms clearly label AI-generated content for easier identification by the users.Infotech minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday that govt has been getting requests to take steps against synthetic content and deepfakes to contain user misinformation.“In Parliament as well as many other fora, people have demanded that something should be done about deepfakes, which are harming society,” he said.People are using some prominent person’s image and creating deepfakes, which are then affecting their personal lives, privacy as well as creating various misconceptions in society. The step we are taking is making sure that users get to know whether something is synthetic or real. Once users know, they can take a call. It’s important that users know what is synthetic and what is real. That distinction will be led through mandatory data labelling,” IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.In the note seeking comments by Nov 6 from stakeholders on draft rules regarding synthetic content, IT ministry says it remains committed to ensuring an open, safe, trusted and accountable internet for all users.“With the increasing availability of generative AI tools and resulting proliferation of synthetically generated information (commonly known as deepfakes), the potential for misuse of such technologies to cause user harm, spread misinformation, manipulate elections or impersonate individuals has grown significantly. Recognising these risks, and following extensive public discussions and parliamentary deliberations, IT ministry has prepared the present draft amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.”The ministry said the draft rules aim to strengthen due diligence obligations for intermediaries, particularly social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries, as well as for platforms that enable the creation or modification of synthetically-generated content.Through the proposed amendments, govt wants a clear definition of synthetically-generated information while mandating labelling and metadata embedding requirements for such information to ensure users can distinguish synthetic from authentic content. Also, it wants visibility and audibility standards requiring that synthetic content be prominently marked, including a minimum 10% visual or initial audio duration coverage. From the intermediaries, it wants “enhanced verification and declaration obligations”, while mandating reasonable technical measures on their part to confirm whether content is synthetically generated which should be labelled accordingly. Separately, the ministry has taken steps to ensure a proper mechanism regarding content takedown pleas to social media platforms, mandating only top-level officers for the job.The ministry has stipulated that intimation to social media platforms for removal of ‘unlawful information’ can only be issued by senior officials and would require precise details and reasons to be specified, as it notified IT Rules amendment to streamline content takedown procedures & bring transparency, clarity and precision in actions.","Govt is considering amendments to the IT law to fix greater accountability on top social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, YouTube and X.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Marc Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The job cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Marc Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch. He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace.

4. Health, Ethics, and the ‘Light Awadhi’ Experiment

Lucknow, a culinary hub, doesn’t merely serve food, it stages a cultural performance around it. This is a city that carries a thousand-year pantry on its back and still finds room for a third-wave cappuccino, a millet bowl, a vegan korma, and a chef’s-table pop-up. ..When I moved to Lucknow as a teenager in 1989, I was in for what I call the ‘Culinary Renaissance’ of my life. Food had always been a passion for me, I loved both eating and creating it in my kitchen, too. But having been born and brought up in Delhi, I was much used to its bolder, robust flavours. Delhi had introduced me to different cuisines, different cultures and I had learned to appreciate the subtleties and nuances of food and its flavours.And now, as I discovered the eateries of Lucknow, I also discovered what it meant to have a refinement on your plate! Lucknow food had in it all that the city boasted about for its language and way of life as well – tehzeeb, tameez and nazakat.Gone was the boldness, there were flavours so subtle, you had to close your eyes to savour them and recognise them, the hint of fragrance that added to its delicate texture, it was an experience so novel to me! Much to my delight, the courtly magic was being recreated on the streets of Lucknow. Here an empire’s slow fire was still warming a city’s restless appetite. This was a city that was still eating its history!Lucknow doesn’t merely serve food; it stages a cultural performance around it.In the lilting cadence of its tehzeeb (etiquette), in the amber gleam of its sheermal, in the whisper of saffron on nimish, the capital of Awadh keeps history simmering on a low, patient flame. You taste it in alleys perfumed with kebab smoke. You hear it in confectioners’ copper pans ringing like temple bells. You see it in the old city’s twilight, as the call to prayer mingles with the clatter of ladles and the fizz of hot ghee.And yet, Lucknow is not a museum. It is alive — restless, inventive, and hungry for what’s next. This is a city that carries a thousand-year pantry on its back and still finds room for a third-wave cappuccino, a millet bowl, a vegan korma, and a chef’s-table pop-up.And I discovered that to write about Lucknow’s culinary quest is to map the delicate bridge between a royal past and a modern palate: to show how the city guards its signature treasures even as it prototypes its future. So I am trying to trace that arc — from age-old culinary heirlooms to the evolving scenario today, and finally to the trends and possibilities shaping tomorrow’s Lucknow.Awadhi cuisine has a royal grammar which speaks of Dum, Dastarkhwan, and Dignity.Dum Pukht: The slow, sealed cooking technique that turns spice into perfume and meat into silk. Pots are pur-dum—lidded and sealed with dough — so flavours mingle in private. What emerges is not food but a treaty among ingredients.Dastarkhwan: The spread where hospitality becomes ritual. A proper Awadhi meal orchestrates hot breads, delicate gravies, aromatic rice, opulent kebabs, pickles, and cooling accompaniments in a choreography that honours guest and ingredient alike.Nafasat (finesse): Awadh’s culinary soul lies in restraint. Spices are persuasive, not loud. Ghee gleams but never gloats. Textures are engineered with the care of a jeweller.The royal kitchens of the Nawabs had fostered an economy of artisans — bawarchis -- who tuned recipes the way gharanas refine ragas: by inheritance, apprenticeship, and stubborn pride.Much of Lucknow’s food memory resides in this generational craft. So kebabs became poetry on a Skewer or a mahi tawa, the Biryani became one that breathed, and the pulaos whispered -- the culinary equivalent of a well-pressed sherwani.The Qormas and Qaliya explore onion-browning science and spice tempering. Nihari and Paya test time’s patience —collagen liquefied into velvet. The breads, innumerable and ranging from the crusty, spongy, flaky to the paper thin. And the desserts from the winter’s miracle — makhan malai to summer’s kulfis.And it still lives on! Aren’t we so fortunate!But as they say, “Change is the only Constant.”And the city’s food map is also changing. But no, Lucknow’s gastronomic present is not a betrayal of tradition but an expansion pack. The city is absorbing global influences while retooling its own classics for new rhythms of work, wellness, and social media.I also see how Social Media is rewriting the script today.From schoolkids to software engineers, everyone’s a reviewer. This democratization rewards places that are authentic and photogenic — clean counters, clear signages, and consistent plating.Menus with story blurbs, vintage typefaces, hand-painted awnings, and packaging that photographs well — the city’s eateries are learning that brand is as edible as biryani.Crucially, social platforms have revived micro-histories too. Docu-style reels on the origin of galouti, explainer carousels on dum science, and listicles of winter-only treats like nimish. The algorithm, ironically, has become a conservator of tradition by making it cool again.As I try to look at the road ahead into the food scenario of my city, I can imagine what the city’s new culinary conversations could be like.Probably, we would be looking towards Sustainability, Season, and Soil.We could expect menus to speak more earnestly about seasonality and waste. Nose-to-tail isn’t just a Western trend; Awadhi cooking always values it, too. From nenue ke chilke ki sabzi to trotter soup, we had it and now contemporary chefs are reviving peel-to-stem practices in vegetarian cookery and composting programs in cafés.We could be looking at Coffee & Tea Bars. Single-origin pours, cold brews, and craft chai menus with terroir talk. Caffeine is culture and community—study hubs by day, date spots by night. Entremets, mousse cakes, laminated viennoiserie; home bakers maturing into storefronts with strong brand identities and pre-order economies.Probably, an Awadhi-Lite Mainstream would emerge. A scalable “light Awadhi” grammar — lower fat, higher fiber, technique forward.Nut emulsions, controlled browning, smoke as seasoning, millet integration where texture allows it. Workday Awadhi becomes as common as office salad bowls — graceful, quick, and repeatable.The farm-linked city menus from Metros will find its place here too.Weekly harvest menus, farmer-chef dinners, GI-style pride around varietals; Diners learning to look forward to seasons for specialised menus.Culinary Tourism finds it a place of pride: Integrated trails—heritage architecture + tasting menus + craft workshops—marketed as weekend packages. Winter “Nimish Festivals,” monsoon “Kebab Carnivals,” and mango-season “Dussehri Darbars” become drawcards.Outcome: Lucknow positions itself as India’s slow-cooking capital and maybe the Unesco recognition for Culinary Excellence we are trying for will be ours.Amongst all this, I sincerely hope, we innovate with restraint. Fusion should be a conversation, not a costume party. I hope every chef who does the new technique serves the Awadhi logic and merely decorates it.Design for Dignity. Clean counters, fair wages, staff training, and respectful service maintain Lucknow’s famous adab. In this city, hospitality is not an act—it’s identity.The soul of the matter is that what makes Lucknow’s culinary culture singular is not just what it cooks — it’s how it lives with its food. The city treats recipes as inheritances, kitchens as classrooms, meals as meetings of dignity. Even as QR codes replace paper menus and algorithmic delivery maps redraw hunger, the old flame keeps burning — the dum fire whose patience taught an empire to eat with grace.If one comes seeking novelty, they will find it. If they come seeking memory, they will find that, too. But come hungry and with time — because this city believes everything worth tasting is worth waiting for.Old City (Chowk, Aminabad, Kaiserbagh, Akbari Gate) still hums with kebab smoke, kulcha stacks, metalware shops, and mithai counters. It’s the keeper of rituals.Gomti Nagar and its extensions | The city’s modern appetite center—patterned with cafés, bakeries, casual pan-Asian, “modern Indian” bistros, dessert bars, and artisanal pizzerias. Here you’ll find chef-led menus, QR ordering, inventive mocktails, and dining rooms tuned for the camera as much as the palate.Hazratganj | A bridge district — old-world arcades, new-world patisserie. Afternoon tea still matters, but so do single-origin pour-overs.Five years ago, the café scene felt niche. Today, it feels inevitable. Third-wave coffees, cold brews, viennoiserie, laminated croissants, and celebration cakes have multiplied. Young pastry chefs trained in metropolitan schools are returning home to open micro-bakeries. The pastry case now sits comfortably next to the kebab skewer in Lucknow’s collective imagination.Delivery apps have recast urban hunger. Cloud kitchens—single or multi-brand outfits without dine-in—let entrepreneurs test menus quickly: Awadhi biryani one month, pan-Asian bowls the next, diet tiffins the third. Social media acts as a real-time focus group. Menus breathe, pivot, and iterate—something unimaginable in the more ceremonial pace of a traditional kitchen.Plant-forward and vegan offerings are no longer outliers. Paneer and mushroom step in where mutton once ruled. Chefs build “Awadhi-lite” menus — keeping the aromatic logic but trimming fat and dairy, swapping refined flour for millet or whole wheat, and using technique to recover mouthfeel.Millets (jowar, bajra, ragi) ride the national revival; chefs test millet roomali, millet sheermal, and millet-based chaats. Not every experiment sings yet, but the city is listening.Clean labels, sourcing transparency, and local pride: Malihabad’s Dussehri mangoes, riverine greens, and nearby farm produce are finding menu mentions. Provenance has become a flavor.Lucknow’s courteous culture has always valorised cooking, but formal recognition and monetization are newer. Home tiffin services, festive dessert boutiques, regional specialty pop-ups (Kayastha kitchens, Vegetarian Awadhi thaal inspirations, Purvanchali delicacies) are scaling through Instagram catalogues, WhatsApp communities, and weekend markets. The result is an explosion of culinary dialects alongside the classical Awadhi tongue.Boutique catering and curated private dining put the chef’s personality at the center; the home becomes a stage set, the menu a narrative arc.","First MasterChef of India, entrepreneur and author of a cookbook Pankaj Bhadouria.

The Twin Shrines & The Hidden Imam: Rauza-e-Samarrah & Maqam-e-Ghaibat















Maqam-e-Ghaibat: Site Commemorating Samarra













For generations, Awadh rulers and nobles built replicas of Shia Islam’s holy shrines, facilitating those who could never make arduous journey to Karbala Kazmain, Kufa, or Samarra to touch the divine right here in Lucknow.Lucknow holds a unique spiritual secret — one of being a city mirroring the sacred geography of the distant country of Iraq . For generations, its rulers and nobles built painstaking replicas of Shia Islam’s holiest shrines, allowing those who could never make the arduous journey to Karbala, Kazmain, Kufa, or Samarra to touch the divine right here in Lucknow.Rising near the riverbank, the Karbala of Dayanat-ud-Daulah stands as a breathtaking testament to devotion.“Built by Wajid Ali Shah’s trusted ‘khwajasara’ (eunuch), Dayanat-ud-Daulah, it is an exact replica of the shrine of Imam Hussain in Karbala, Iraq – down to the very measurements,” claims Ammar Yasir Rizvi, an expert of Awadh’s cultural heritage.While the dome of the original shrine shines with pure gold, Lucknow’s version shimmered under thick sheets of gold-plated silver.Step inside, and intricate wooden pillars, kaleidoscopic stained glass, and dazzling mirror work create a space of hushed reverence, echoing the artistry of its Iraqi counterpart.“This isn’t merely architecture; it’s the soul of Karbala reborn in Lucknow, becoming the focal point for the city’s profound Muharram rituals, forever binding the fates of the two cities,” adds Rizvi.During the reign of King Amjad Ali Shah, a remarkable testament to unity arose. Kazmain, the replica of the Baghdad shrine housing the relics of the 7th Imam, Musa Kazim, was commissioned not by a Muslim noble, but by the Hindu minister in Jagan Nath (Sharaf-ud-Daula).“Its dimensions meticulously matched the original, a symbol of shared reverence transcending faith,” states Mehmood M Abdi, an oral historian and cultural expert. Adjacent to Kazmain lies another echo: Shabih-e-Masjid-e-Kufa. Built by Nawab Rafeeq-ud-Daulah, one of the ministers of King Muhammad Ali Shah, this mosque recreates the place where Hazrat Ali was martyred. “Every detail, from structure to its reddish-brown hue, mirrored the original Kufa mosque as it stood then,” explains Dr Sanobar Haider, a historian. “Adding a touch of practical devotion unique to Lucknow, it even houses a ‘dhoop-ghadi’ (sundial), ensuring prayers are called at the precise moment ordained by the sun,” she adds.Within Lucknow’s sacred complex, a poignant replica honours the young martyrs: Hazrat Muhammad and Hazrat Ibrahim, sons of Hazrat Muslim ibn Aqeel. Built by Munshi Fazal Husain during Wajid Ali Shah’s time, this Rauza mirrors their shrine in Musayyab, Iraq.It provides a place for Lucknow’s faithful to mourn these innocent souls, embodying the city’s tradition of creating Shabi-e-Rauza– local sanctuaries for those unable to pilgrimage to Iraq’s hallowed ground,” says Syed Husain Afsar, a veteran journalist.Deep within the Gharwali Karbala area, Lucknow’s connection to Samarra unfolds. Rauza-e-Samarrah (or Rauza-e-Askarien), commissioned by Malka Afaq Sahiba, wife of King Muhammad Ali Shah, is a replica of the magnificent Iraqi shrine complex housing the 10th and 11th Imams – Imam Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi) and Imam Hasan al-Askari.“While less ornate than the original’s famed golden dome and minarets, this Lucknow counterpart, encompassing a mausoleum and Imambara, became a vital local centre for mourning and remembrance, especially during the commemorations of Imam Hasan al-Askari’s martyrdom, weathering times of both neglect and renewal,” says SN Lal, veteran journalist and author of the book ‘Azadari aur Awadh’.Beside this sacred echo lies perhaps the most profound symbol: The Maqam-e-Ghaibat. This site commemorates the very spot in Samarra, Iraq, associated with the occultation (Ghaibat) of the 12th Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi. “In Lucknow, this symbolic Maqam, integrated near the Rauza-e-Samarrah, draws devotees who pray for the Imam’s reappearance,” explains Zulkifl Rizvi, who writes on Lucknow’s cultural heritage. “Marked by Alams and religious symbols, it stands as a powerful testament to Lucknow’s profound tradition – replicating not just buildings, but the very essence of Iraq’s sacred geography, forging an unbreakable spiritual link between the banks of the Tigris and the Gomti,” he adds.","For generations, Awadh rulers and nobles built replicas of Shia Islam’s holy shrines in Iraq, enabling devotees to experience sacred geography locally. The Karbala of Dayanat-ud-Daulah stands as a breathtaking testament to devotion. The replica of the Baghdad shrine housing the relics of the 7th Imam, Musa Kazim, was commissioned not by a Muslim noble, but by the Hindu minister in Jagan Nath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124752253,imgsize-1793045,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/awadh-rulers-and-nobles-in-lucknow-meticulously-built-replicas-of-shia-islam39s-holiest-shrines-in-iraq-enabling-devotees-to-experience-sacred-geography-locally.jpg"

What’s the buzz about the Orionid Meteor shower?

Best time across the US

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Special mention - Purple roof

Hala taxi: The digital booking revolution

Fare uniformity across colours

Why Dubai taxi ’s colour system works?





Dubai’s public transportation is renowned globally for its sophistication and user-friendly approach. Among its numerous transit options, the taxi network stands out for its unique feature - brightly coloured roofs. These colours are not mere aesthetics but represent different taxi operators under the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), ensuring order in one of the world’s busiest taxi fleets. With over 12,000 taxis plying the city’s streets, understanding this colour code is essential for residents and visitors alike.Dubai’s taxi roof colour scheme was introduced in the late 2000s as a strategic move to unify and brand the city's taxi services. Previously, taxis were inconsistent in appearance and service quality, causing passenger confusion. Today, every taxi sports a uniform sand-coloured body, with the only visual differentiation on the roof. This system makes it easy for passengers to identify the operator, report lost items, and recognize the taxi’s route and purpose. Despite differing colours, all taxis operate under RTA regulations, guaranteeing consistent fares and safety standards.The coloured roofs correspond to specific taxi companies, each with distinct fleet sizes, service areas, and commitments to technology or sustainability.Though not widespread, purple roofs belong to Kabi Taxi, Dubai’s newest company focusing on modernity and practicality in their smaller fleet.Introduced in 2019 as a partnership between the RTA and ride-hailing giant Careem, Hala Taxi is a digital booking platform that connects passengers to the nearest available RTA-approved taxi, regardless of roof colour. This 24/7 service offers real-time tracking, seamless cashless payments, and convenience for riders. A ride booked via Hala Taxi typically starts at around AED 12, with fares regulated by the RTA to maintain consistency.Importantly, the colourful roofs do not affect the fare. All taxis follow the RTA’s standardized fare structure, which includes base fare, per kilometre charges, and waiting time costs that are consistent citywide. Any price differences generally come from booking platform service fees or minimum fare thresholds but never from the taxi operator.Dubai’s colour-coded taxi system facilitates efficiency and transparency. It helps passengers select taxis based on availability, preferred service (such as women-only rides), or environmental priorities without worrying about fare disparities or service standards. Furthermore, the system fosters healthy competition among operators, all while maintaining safety and regulatory oversight.Booking and Availability TipsWhile the popular ride-hailing app Careem connects users to all taxi types, it does not allow selection by roof colour. Passengers who prefer a specific taxi operator can call the respective hotlines or use operator-specific apps like DTC’s app for red and pink taxis. This increases the chances of getting a preferred taxi colour matching individual needs.In summary, Dubai’s taxi fleet is a model of organisation and clarity amid urban complexity. The colour-coded roofs help passengers easily identify taxi operators, with consistent fare pricing and safety regulations across all. From the large red fleet of Dubai Taxi Corporation to the environmentally friendly green Arabia Taxis and the women-only pink cabs, the system caters efficiently to diverse needs. With convenient booking via hotlines, apps, and the popular Hala Taxi platform, Dubai’s taxis offer reliable, accessible transportation for both residents and tourists.","Dubai taxi roofs are colour-coded, with different colours implying a different kind of ride.

The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) of Dubai has unveiled a revamped taxi fare structure applicable immediately to all smart app bookings and regular city taxis. The updated fare schedule introduces higher minimum charges and booking fees tailored to different times of the day and days of the week, aiming to streamline pricing and enhance service quality across the emirate.Under the new fare system, taxi rides booked via e-hailing platforms such as Hala and Careem now carry a minimum fare of AED 13, up from the previous AED 12. The booking fees and starting fares (flagfall) fluctuate by peak, off-peak, and night-time windows.Peak HoursFrom Monday to Thursday, peak hours are set between 8 am and 9:59 am and later from 4 pm to 7:59 pm. During these time slots, passengers face a booking fee of AED 7.50 alongside a flagfall charge of AED 5. On Fridays, peak hours extend to 9:59 pm, with the same booking fee and starting fare. Meanwhile, Friday's late evenings between 10 pm and 11:59 pm see a slightly increased flagfall fare of AED 5.50, with the booking fee maintained at AED 7.50.Off-Peak and Night FaresOutside peak times on weekdays, from 6 am to 7:59 am and 10 am to 3:59 pm, the booking fee drops to AED 4 while the flagfall fare remains AED 5. Night-time travel, defined as between 10 pm and 5:59 am, carries a booking fee of AED 4.50 and a flagfall priced at AED 5.50.On weekends, Saturdays and Sundays experience peak periods from 4 pm to 9:59 pm and 10 pm to 11:59 pm, with a booking fee of AED 7.50 plus a flagfall of AED 5 during the early peak and AED 5.50 later into the night. Off-peak hours during the day maintain the AED 4 booking fee and AED 5 flagfall. The night-time booking and flagfall charges mirror weekday night tariffs.The comprehensive fare overhaul not only impacts commuter costs but aligns both traditional taxi and e-hailing pricing structures, providing greater consistency across transport options in Dubai.Aside from fare revisions, RTA has also launched a series of 28 initiatives enhancing the taxi experience. These include upgraded driver uniforms designed for Dubai’s climate, improved leather seating for hygiene and comfort, real-time air quality sensors installed in taxis, and integral feedback systems allowing passengers a direct line to RTA for service monitoring. Additionally, drivers benefit from reward programs totaling over AED 8 million.Commuters should expect slightly higher upfront costs during peak and late-night rides, but with improved ride quality underpinned by technological advances and service innovations by the RTA.The updated fares are effective immediately with the RTA monitoring usage and service levels to assess the impact of these changes on public transport in the city.","Dubai RTA announces taxi fare hike, surges booking fees for peak and night trips.

Kuwait's new rule: Mosques cannot install surveillance cameras without Ministry permission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwaits-new-rule-mosques-cannot-install-surveillance-cameras-without-ministry-permission/articleshow/124699894.cms,"Kuwait’s Awqaf Ministry issues strict new guidelines for mosque surveillance – monitoring, oversight and accountability now firmly in state hands / AI generated image for Illustration purposes only

What’s happening? Mosque surveillance rules in Kuwait

Any individual or organisation wishing to install or operate security cameras inside a mosque must first receive authorisation from the ministry.

Donations of cameras must be reported before installation: if someone offers a donation of surveillance equipment, the mosque’s imam or muezzin must notify the ministry before proceeding.

Any existing camera systems that were installed without ministry approval must be disclosed immediately.

The imams and muezzins will be held legally accountable if they fail to notify the ministry of unapproved systems.

The ministry states this is part of a broader effort to standardise mosque operations, protect mosque facilities and ensure the safety of worshippers.

Why the change?

Protection and safety of worshippers & facilities: The ministry explicitly says the aim is to safeguard the mosque premises, maintain safety, and ensure transparency.

Administrative control & oversight: By centralising supervision of camera systems, the ministry can ensure that installations comply with law and policy, rather than having ad-hoc or external parties setting up systems independently.

Standardising practices across mosques: The directive emphasises the goal of standardisation of mosque operations and functioning under governmental supervision.

Legitimacy of donations and external offers: Since mosques sometimes receive donated surveillance equipment (as happened in the past) the ministry appears to want to regulate that process tightly. For example, older reports show a corporate donation of 3,000 cameras to mosques in Kuwait from 2017.

Impacts and practical implications





On October 19, 2025, Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs issued a nationwide directive mandating that all surveillance cameras within mosques must receive prior approval from the ministry. This move places imams and muezzins under legal obligation to comply, marking a significant shift in the oversight of religious institutions across the country.Kuwait's Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has announced a new policy requiring all surveillance cameras in mosques to be approved by the ministry before installation. This directive, issued on October 19, 2025, mandates that imams and muezzins report any existing unapproved camera systems and prohibits unauthorized installations. The policy aims to standardize mosque operations, ensure transparency, and safeguard the facilities and worshippers.Key points:In short: New oversight means all surveillance inside mosques now must go through official channels.The ministry's decision comes in response to concerns over unauthorized surveillance installations and the need for centralized oversight. By requiring prior approval, the ministry seeks to maintain control over security measures in religious spaces, ensuring they align with national regulations and standards.This move also addresses potential privacy issues and aims to prevent misuse of surveillance systems.Several motivations appear behind this tightening of rules:Thus, the change reflects a move to ensure that mosque-surveillance is neither fragmented nor uncontrolled.The new rules have clear implications for mosques, imams, worshippers, and donors. Under the directive, no mosque can unilaterally accept or install surveillance cameras from external parties, including companies or donors, without prior ministry approval. Transparency is now mandatory: any offer of surveillance equipment must be reported before installation, and existing systems installed without authorization must be declared. Imams and muezzins carry legal responsibility for failing to comply, elevating the policy from mere guidance to enforceable law. All systems will fall under the ministry’s administrative oversight, which will likely regulate how cameras are installed, managed, and monitored. For donors, this means that contributions of surveillance equipment will require navigation through the approval process, replacing the previous practice of direct donations or installations. Overall, the directive establishes the ministry as the central gatekeeper for all mosque surveillance.For mosques across Kuwait, this policy means that any new surveillance installations must go through the ministry's approval process. Imams and muezzins are now legally responsible for promptly reporting any unapproved systems and ensuring compliance with the new strict regulations. Donors wishing to contribute surveillance equipment must also notify the ministry before installation. This centralized approach aims to streamline security measures and maintain consistent uniformity across all religious institutions.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs issued a nationwide directive mandating that all surveillance cameras within mosques must receive prior approval from the ministry.

Abu Dhabi launches new traffic Black Points and licence reinstatement campaign: Here's what every motorist must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-launches-new-traffic-black-points-and-licence-reinstatement-campaign-heres-what-every-motorist-must-know/articleshow/124688843.cms,"Abu Dhabi Police introduce a new program to reduce traffic Black Points and reinstate suspended driving licences. Image: AI Representative Image.

Black Points system: How does the new program work?

Steps to avail services

Visit the Abu Dhabi Police platform on the first floor of Mushrif Mall Centre during the program period. Choose between point reduction (if under 24 points) or licence reinstatement (if suspended). Pay the applicable fee (Dh 800 for reduction, Dh 2,400 for reinstatement). Attend the educational courses and workshops in person. Complete the program to have points reduced or licence reinstated.

Abu Dhabi's context for broader traffic safety

Quick recap

Date Time Location Eligibility Service Process Mode Fee (AED) Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with fewer than 24 black points Reduce Black Points Attend traffic safety workshops In-person only 800 Oct 20 – Nov 20, 2025 4 pm – 10 pm Mushrif Mall Centre, Abu Dhabi Drivers with suspended licences (24+ points) Reinstate Licence Enroll in rehabilitation courses and complete education In-person only 2,400





Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences, running from October 20 to November 20, 2025. This one-month program operates daily between 4 pm and 10 pm at the Mushrif Mall Centre, first-floor Police platform, and aims to promote safer roads through education, making it easier for motorists to rectify violations.Black points are demerit points given out for serious traffic violations and accumulate according to how dangerous the offence is. Once a driver hits 24 points within a year, their licence usually gets suspended. This program gives drivers two clear options: lower their black points or reinstate a suspended licence.If you have fewer than 24 black points, you can attend specially designed workshops and educational courses to reduce up to eight points from your record. These sessions focus on educating drivers about traffic rules, safe driving habits, and the consequences of violations. The fee for this course is Dh800.For those whose licences have been suspended after surpassing 24 points, the route to reinstatement involves enrolling in a more comprehensive rehabilitation course. Upon successful completion and payment of Dh2,400, your driving licence can be restored. This educative approach helps ensure that reinstated drivers are better informed and more cautious moving forward.Importantly, the program is strictly an in-person affair. Motorists must physically be present at the Mushrif Mall Centre during the dates and timings because there is no online registration or virtual participation option. This ensures that participants get the full benefit of interacting with trainers and engaging in the corrective sessions.The initiative clearly reflects Abu Dhabi Police’s ongoing dedication to community safety by actively encouraging voluntary compliance and shared responsibility rather than resorting solely to fines and suspensions. It also builds on earlier successful efforts such as similar awareness programs launched at major events like the Abu Dhabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition (ADIHEX) earlier in the year, reinforcing a culture of mutual respect and proactive participation.Black point penalties continue to stay on a driver’s record for one year, and avoiding violations during that time can help clear them. Drivers also have the ability to contest fines or have points transferred if the actual offender is identified. Along with various awareness campaigns, such as “A Day Without Accident,” these efforts collectively aim at fostering a safer road environment for all.In summary, Abu Dhabi aims to encourage safer driving habits, reduce accidents, and improve overall road safety . Mark your calendar, take advantage of this important initiative and get your driving record back on track.","Abu Dhabi Police has launched a key initiative allowing drivers to reduce traffic black points or reinstate suspended licences.

A billionaire’s private life under scrutiny







Eric Schmidt, the 70-year-old former Google CEO, has been accused by his 31-year-old ex-girlfriend, Michelle Ritter, of abuse, stalking, and what she described as “absolute digital surveillance.” According to court filings obtained by The New York Post, Ritter alleged that Schmidt used his influence, wealth, and technical expertise to monitor her private communications and control her access to finances and property.The former couple’s relationship reportedly began in 2020, when Ritter was a student at Columbia University. The pair are now locked in a legal dispute involving multimillion-dollar settlements, a failed AI startup, and allegations of psychological control. Ritter claims Schmidt employed private investigators, coerced her into silence, and locked her out of shared business accounts and homes.Court filings reveal that Ritter and Schmidt maintained both romantic and business ties through Steel Perlot, an AI-focused venture into which Schmidt invested roughly $100 million. Ritter accuses Schmidt of using his power to impose “a system of total control” and claims he tracked her movements digitally.Schmidt, who remains married to philanthropist Wendy Schmidt, has denied the allegations through his attorneys, describing them as “demonstrably false” and “a misuse of the judicial process. ” Most filings remain sealed ahead of a December 2025 court hearing.In her filings, Ritter alleges that Schmidt pressured her to sign false declarations denying any misconduct while cutting off her access to shared assets and residences in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. She further claimed her parents were followed by private investigators tied to Schmidt’s security detail. Despite withdrawing a previous restraining order after an apparent settlement, Ritter says Schmidt failed to fulfil his obligations and continues to pursue her through arbitration — a move she characterises as an attempt to “suppress exposure of his misconduct and abuse. ”This is not the first time Schmidt’s personal life has drawn public attention. Reports from Forbes and The Information have detailed turmoil within Steel Perlot, describing it as a chaotic venture entangled with personal and professional conflicts. Schmidt, whose net worth is estimated at $44.8 billion, has long been known for maintaining an open marriage and relationships with younger women. As the latest legal battle unfolds, the case reignites debate about privacy, power, and accountability in Silicon Valley’s elite circles — where technology, money, and influence can easily blur personal boundaries.","Michelle Ritter, 31, accuses former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, 70, of abuse, stalking, and what she described as ‘absolute digital surveillance’ Ritter claims Schmidt employed private investigators, coerced her into silence, and locked her out of shared business accounts and homes.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

What made Tea and TeaOnHer dating apps controversial





Two controversial dating safety apps, Tea and TeaOnHer, have been pulled from the Apple App Store following violations of Apple ’s guidelines on content moderation and user privacy. The removal, first reported by app store intelligence provider Appfigures, occurred earlier this week across all markets. Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that the apps were removed due to non-compliance with App Review Guidelines 1.2, 5.1.2, and 5.6, which address user-generated content moderation, unauthorized sharing of personal information, and excessive user complaints.Both apps, however, remain available on Google Play Store According to an Apple representative, the apps failed to address concerns raised by the company, including reports of minors’ personal information being shared. Negative user reviews and complaints further contributed to the decision. The developers of Tea and TeaOnHer have not yet responded to requests for comment.Tea, launched in 2023 and gaining viral attention in 2025, marketed itself as a safety tool for women, allowing users to share details about men on dating apps, including personal information, reviews, and “green flag” or “red flag” labels, similar to the “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” Facebook groups.However, the app faced backlash from men who argued it violated their privacy and raised defamation concerns. Over the summer, Tea suffered a significant data breach, exposing 72,000 images, including 3,000 selfies and photo IDs used for account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts and messages.TeaOnHer, a rival app launched to allow men to review women similarly, also faced scrutiny after TechCrunch reported security flaws in August that exposed users’ personal data, including government IDs and selfies. According to Appfigures, Tea recorded 6.1 million lifetime downloads and $5 million in gross revenue, while TeaOnHer saw 2.2 million downloads without in-app purchases. Despite their removal from the App Store, copycat apps are gaining traction. Notably, TeaOnHer and Him – Overheard has climbed from No. 90 to No. 27 on the Overall Top App Charts, with 354,000 downloads.As the apps remain live on Google Play, questions linger about their future and the broader implications for user privacy and safety in dating app ecosystems.","Tea and TeaOnHer dating apps have been removed from the Apple App Store.

What Perplexity said on Reddit's lawsuit





Lawsuits against AI chabot companies have been piling up. Latest to face legal trouble is Perplexity. On Wednesday, October 22, social media giant Reddit filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against artificial intelligence startup Perplexity and three data-scraping companies: Lithuania-based Oxylabs, Russia-based AWMProxy, and Texas-based SerpApi. In its complaint, Reddit claims that these companies unlawfully scraped Reddit’s data to train Perplexity’s AI-powered “answer engine,”. Reddit said that the data-scraping companies circumvented its data protection measures to steal data that Perplexity ""desperately needs"" to power its ""answer engine"" system.The lawsuit against Reddit is part of a growing wave of legal challenges by content owners against tech companies, accusing them of misusing copyrighted material to train AI systems.Reddit, known for its vast network of interest-based “subreddit” communities, claims its platform is the most frequently cited source for AI-generated responses to user queries. The company accuses Perplexity of collaborating with at least one of the named data-scraping firms to access billions of search results without permission, despite lacking a license to use Reddit’s content. Reddit has previously licensed its data to companies like Google and OpenAI for AI training purposes.The lawsuit follows a similar legal action Reddit initiated against AI startup Anthropic in June, which remains ongoing. Reddit’s chief legal officer, Ben Lee, described the case as part of a broader issue, stating, “AI companies are locked in an arms race for quality human content—and that pressure has fueled an industrial-scale ‘data laundering’ economy.”Reddit alleges it sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist letter last year, after which Perplexity reportedly increased its citations to Reddit content “forty-fold.” The company is now seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court order to prevent Perplexity from using its dataIn response, Perplexity defended its practices. In a statement, the company said, “Our approach remains principled and responsible as we provide factual answers with accurate AI, and we will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.”",Reddit files lawsuit against AI startup Perplexity and three data-scraping companies.

Australia has reportedly launched an investigation into the safety practice of several artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot companies, asking them to explain how they prevent minors from being exposed to harmful or sexual content. According to a Reuters report, the country’s eSafety Commissioner has sent notice to Character Technologies, owner of celebrity simulation chatbot tool character.ai, and rivals Glimpse.AI, Chai Research and Chub AI demanding explanations of their content filters, child protection systems and moderation processes.The regulator, as per the report, said that the step was necessary amid rising fears that unregulated AI chatbots could expose young users to sexual conversations or promote self-harm.The Reuters report quotes Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in the statement: “There can be a darker side to some of these services, with many ... chatbots capable of engaging in sexually explicit conversations with minors,” adding “Concerns have been raised that they may also encourage suicide, self-harm and disordered eating.”The order comes under Australia’s strict online safety framework, which allows the regulator to compel companies to reveal their safety measures or face fines of up to A$825,000 (about $536,000) per day.Character.ai, one of the largest AI chatbot platforms, is already facing a lawsuit in the U.S. after the mother of a teenager alleged that her son took his own life following repeated chats with an AI companion. The company has said it has since introduced safety alerts that link users expressing suicidal thoughts to mental health hotlines.The eSafety office said it has received reports from schools suggesting that some students spend up to five hours a day chatting with AI bots — in some cases about sexual topics. Experts warn that such prolonged exposure can lead to emotional dependency or risky behavior among children.According to Reuters, OpenAI — the creator of ChatGPT — has not been included in this round of inquiries because Australia’s current safety code applies only to AI chatbots designed for companionship or role-play. ChatGPT will fall under the same regulatory framework from March 2026.From December, social media companies in Australia will be required to block or delete accounts belonging to users under 16 years of age or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million – part of the government’s broader push to safeguard young people's mental and physical health.","Australia has reportedly launched an investigation into the safety practice of several artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot companies.
