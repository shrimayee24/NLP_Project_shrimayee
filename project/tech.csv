Alien Creature: 'Alien-like' creature on Australian beach draws massive curiosity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/alien-like-creature-on-australian-beach-draws-massive-curiosity-here-is-what-it-really-is/articleshow/114811815.cms,"'Alien-like' creature on Australian beach draws massive curiosity - Here is what it really is (Picture credit: Vicki Evans)

A strange “alien-like” sea creature washed ashore on Horseshoe Bay in Port Elliott , South Australia, leaving locals astonished and creating widespread curiosity among netizens.Vicki Evans, a beachcomber, encountered the creature while walking along the shore and captured photos that she shared on a community Facebook page.“Over 26 years walking Horseshoe Bay – I’ve never seen anything quite like this before!” Evans wrote, describing her shock at the sight. The photo quickly caught attention, with users expressing amazement at the odd find, calling it the “freakiest thing” they’d ever seen and speculating wildly about its origins.The creature appeared to be around three meters long, featuring translucent stalks covered in vermicelli-like tendrils and bead-like shells that dangled off the ends like seaweed.Many commenters described it as looking almost alien or like something out of science fiction, while some wondered if it was a rare form of jellyfish or an unknown deep-sea species . One Facebook user commented, “Wow, it looks long judging by the scale of the dog,” referencing Evans’s dog, which appeared in the photo for comparison.As per the New York Post, Marine ecologist Dr Zoe Doubleday from the University of South Australiawas soon able to solve the mystery, identifying the “alien” as a large colony of goose barnacles , a species of communal crustacean.Goose barnacles typically attach themselves to floating objects, ship hulls, and wharves.Dr Doubleday speculated that this colony had broken off from its original anchor point, which she called the “mothership,” and drifted to shore in a rare display. She remarked that while goose barnacles are common in Australian waters, it is unusual to see such a large intact cluster.Goose barnacles, scientifically known as ‘ Lepas anatifera ’, are a delicacy in certain parts of Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal, where they are known as ‘Percebes’.They are often served at upscale restaurants and can command prices as high as $125 per pound.","A strange “alien-like” sea creature washed ashore on Horseshoe Bay in Port Elliott, South Australia.

If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

What helped Microsoft to increase its gaming revenue



How other divisions of Microsoft contributed



Microsoft has announced its Q1 2025 earnings result. The biggest highlight in the tech giant’s report was a significant increase in gaming revenue , driven by strong growth in Xbox content and services. However, the company noted that its Xbox hardware revenue continues to decline. The latest earnings report shows a 61% year-over-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue which the company largely attributed to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard . Meanwhile, Microsoft also reported a 29% decline in Xbox hardware revenue. The company’s strategy of making its games available on multiple platforms, including PC and cloud gaming , may have contributed to the decline in its hardware sales. Apart from this, Microsoft also reported an increase in AI cloud services, OEM and device revenue.Microsoft's Q1 2025 gaming revenue growth was driven by the introduction of the new Xbox Game Pass ""Standard"" tier, an increase in the price for the Game Pass Ultimate subscription and the addition of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III to the Game Pass library.However, this quarter's figures do not include the impact of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launched last week. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also claimed it to be the “biggest Call of Duty release ever”.The company's Intelligent Cloud division saw a 20% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $24.1 billion, fueled by Azure and its AI services .Productivity and Business Processes, which include Office products, also experienced a 12% revenue growth. While overall OEM and Devices revenue increased slightly (2%), this was primarily due to Windows OEM, offsetting a decline in device sales.Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, particularly in its Copilot platform, recognising the potential of AI across various industries. The company's AI business is expected to cross a $10 billion annual run rate this quarter.Despite facing challenges like the recent CrowdStrike outage that caused widespread disruptions, Microsoft also remains focused on security and innovation.","Microsoft has announced its Q1 2025 earnings result.

'AI risks need understanding'

Tony Fadell , known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs , expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 in San Francisco, US, Fadell took aim at OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Talking about his understanding of the history of AI development before the large language model (LLM) craze and the issues with LLM hallucinations, he reportedly said, “I’ve been doing AI for 15 years, people, I’m not just spouting s—. I’m not Sam Altman, okay?”During the spirited interview, Fadell criticized the overhyped nature of LLMs and their propensity for hallucinations. He highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in AI development, arguing that current models lack both. ""LLMs are trying to be this 'general' thing because we're trying to make science fiction happen,"" he said. ""They're a know-it-all... I hate know-it-alls.""Instead of relying on these general-purpose models, Fadell advocated for specialized AI agents that are trained on specific tasks and are more transparent about their limitations. He emphasized the need for greater regulation to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.The criticism of Altman came as Fadell shared his own experiences with AI, dating back to his work at Nest. He noted that even a decade ago, AI was a sensitive topic, and people were wary of its potential implications. However, the recent AI boom has led to a widespread adoption of these technologies without a full understanding of their limitations and risks.Fadell's comments serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of unchecked AI development. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to approach these technologies with caution and a critical eye.","Tony Fadell, known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs, expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm.

Days after it was reported that YouTube is experimenting with a new website layout that hides two key pieces of information: the upload date and the view count of videos the Google-owned company has responded, providing a clarification on what may be happening.A new layout was spotted in the wild by X user @vidIQ and was reported upon by an online publication Dexerto. It claimed that YouTube is experimenting with a new website layout that hides key information from users and the redesigned homepage removes both the upload date and view count from video previews, leaving only the thumbnail, title, and channel name visible.The report grabbed eyeballs with several content creators , including Marques Brownlee , also known as MKBHD, a popular tech YouTuber, saying, “Stop chasing Netflix and just be YouTube.” While some expressed that while removing view counts is acceptable, removing dates isn't ideal.The proposed changes to YouTube's homepage layout have sparked debate about their potential impact on content visibility. Some users worry that hiding view counts and upload dates could lead to viewers overlooking videos with lower engagement, while others argue that it could create a more level playing field for new creators by reducing the bias towards videos with high view counts.In response, YouTube clarified that it is due to extensions that the homepage experience is changed.@Dexerto Jumping in here to clarify that this may happen if viewers are watching YouTube with certain browser extensions enabled.

As online grocery platforms like Zomato's Blinkit gain traction by offering rapid delivery services for festive purchases, a troubling incident has emerged from Delhi. Mohit Jain, a resident of the city, claims he was scammed while ordering gold and silver coins for Dhanteras , a significant occasion for buying precious metals. Despite the promise of a swift 10-minute delivery, Jain alleges that he received a 0.5-gram gold coin instead of the one-gram coin he ordered.This incident has not only raised questions about the reliability of such services but also sparked outrage among customers regarding Blinkit's customer support and the accuracy of their deliveries, prompting a broader conversation about consumer protection in the burgeoning quick-commerce sector.Sharing his ordeal on social media platform X, Mohit stated, “I got scammed by Blinkit. I ordered a one-gram gold coin along with a one-gram silver coin. The payment was made in advance. Since I wasn’t home to receive the delivery, I provided my younger brother with the OTP to collect it.”Upon returning home about 20 minutes later, Mohit was shocked to discover the wrong item had been delivered. He explained, “When I checked, I found that I received a 0.5-gram Malabar gold coin (rose design) instead of the one-gram Mata Lakshmi gold coin I ordered.”Frustrated by the situation, Mohit noted that by the time he got home, the return window had closed, preventing him from contacting customer support. “I called the delivery person and was nearly in tears while explaining the situation,” he shared.Despite the delivery partner having photographic evidence of the correct one-gram coin that was supposed to be delivered, Mohit reported that the delivery person stated he could do nothing about the error.Mohit also emphasised that CCTV footage corroborated his claim, showing that the incorrect item had been delivered. Accompanying his tweet, he posted a picture of the 0.5-gram gold coin he received and screenshots of his order details.According to his order confirmation, Mohit had purchased a 24 kt, one-gram Goddess Lakshmi gold coin but instead received a 0.5-gram coin with a rose design. He had also ordered a 10-gram Laxmi Ganesh silver coin, both listed under Malabar Gold & Diamonds. In his communication with Blinkit's customer support, Mohit received a message stating, “We are sorry. The complaint window for the selected item(s) is closed.” An automated response suggested that he provide feedback on the issue to help improve their services.The incident has sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with users expressing their frustration with Blinkit's service. One user wrote, ""Blinkit is a scam these days. Their customer care is a complete joke. Avoid ordering expensive items from them."" Another user questioned, “What is this behaviour?” while a third urged, “Blinkit, please look into this.” A fourth user vented, ""Have some shame, corporate greed!""","Mohit Jain claims he was scammed while ordering gold and silver coins for Dhanteras.

The ""Incident"" in Montreal - Survivor Series

Scandals have always been rampant in the WWE and many popular Superstars have often found themselves involved in situations that they wouldn’t really like to be involved in. While some of these scandals haven’t amounted to anything, others have eventually resulted in lawsuits, especially in the case of Vince McMohan.So, here’s a list of WWE Superstars who were involved in some of the most scandalous events in the history of the promotion.Vince McMohan has been involved in a lot of scandals over the years, from making out with Divas back stage to an alleged sex trafficking issue, the individual probably has the most number of scandals to his name.However, one of the more interesting ones was where he was involved in a feud with Donald Trump , who had “bought” RAW. This caused the company’s shares to plummet, forcing McMohan to “buy” RAW again one week later.Rob Van Dam was one of the first high-flyers to have been part of the Stamford-based promotion. He won the WWE Championship from John Cena at ECW One Night Stand in 2006. However, soon after his victory, Sabu and him were pulled over and arrested for possession of Marijuana.Following this arrest, Van Dam was stripped of the title and was handed a 30-day suspension as a punishment for the incident that occured.Leading into the 2000s, WWE programming became pretty unhinged and the company experimented with multiple real-life angles more frequently. However, all this started back in 1996 in a segment that involved both Brian Pillman and Stone Cold Steve Austin When these two were feuding at that point, Steve Austin ended up at Pillman’s home one time, where the latter pulled up a loaded gun on the Rattlesnake threatening to kill him. This incident almost caused RAW to get banned on the USA Network. The company had to go to great lengths to prevent that from happening.Also read: “They need to prove it”: Janel Grant's reps slam WWE for taking so long to waive NDAs Chris Benoit’s death was one of the most horrifying incidents that happened within the world of professional wrestling. The former World Heavyweight Champion shot himself after murdering his wife and child.Experts stated that the individual wasn’t healthy mentally, which was a direct result of him working at the company. WWE drew a lot of heat from the fans, because Benoit had become what he was, under the watchful eye of the Stamford-based promotion.No list of scandals is incomplete without mentioning “The Montreal Screwjob,” and rather than instigating it, Bret Hart was unfortunately the victim of this incident. The Montreal Screwjob happened in 1997 at Survivor Series in Montreal.To simply put the incident, Bret Hart was supposed to drop his Championship to a wrestler other than Shawn Michaels before moving on to WCW, but Vince McMohan ensured that he’d drop it to the Heartbreak Kid at that very match. To get to his desired result, McMohan involved the referee Earl Hebner who prematurely rang the bell when Hart was put in a Sharpshooter.Also read: Could Vince McMahon’s New Entertainment Company Create the Next Big Sports League?","Vince McMohan has been involved in a lot of scandals over the years, from making out with Divas back stage to an alleged sex trafficking issue.

Solo Sikoa drops huge Sami Zayn hint ahead of WWE Crown Jewel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/solo-sikoa-drops-huge-sami-zayn-hint-ahead-of-wwe-crown-jewel/articleshow/114781303.cms,"Solo Sikoa has just dropped a huge hint related to Sami Zayn (Image via WWE)

Is Sami Zayn about to betray Roman Reigns by joining Solo Sikoa?

WWE Crown Jewel is merely days away from airing, and Sami Zayn ’s involvement in the PLE still hangs in the balance. However, Solo Sikoa has just dropped a huge hint suggesting that Sami could be joining his ranks. Solo took to his Instagram and posted a picture with Sami with the words “My Dawg” written on it. On the latest episode of RAW, Jimmy and Jey Uso spotted Sami having a conversation with Solo and his crew. This occurred after Jey had disrespected Sami earlier during the same episode.Now that Solo has posted this picture, the noise suggesting that Sami will join his Bloodline will grow louder than ever. However, despite the disrespect Sami thinks of Jey Uso as a friend, so is he truly about to betray him? Let’s take a closer look at the situation.Also Read: Sami Zayn a Misfit in The Bloodline? WWE Legend Thinks So Sami Zayn has always thrived when playing the role of a heel. So, if he joins Solo Sikoa it could do wonders for the “Honorary Uce”. But, the situation seems a little too straightforward to be true. We have to take into account that the Bloodline’s storyline has been full of shocking twists and betrayals.So, what could end up happening is that Sami joins Solo, but only to betray him later. This way, Sami will be able to protect his friend Jey, while Roman Reigns gets to reclaim his Ula Fala and hopefully his position as The Head of The Table. However, if Sami has indeed betrayed Jey and is joining Solo’s Bloodline, then Roman and the Usos are about to be in for a hard time.Roman was already at a number’s disadvantage heading into this battle and if Sami is joining the other side, the gap might become too big to overcome. A lot will change depending on what Sami Zayn has decided for himself, and judging from the picture posted by Solo, it's not looking good for Roman Reigns and the crew.Also Read: 3 Reasons why Sami Zayn should also join the OG Bloodline alongside Jey Uso",Sami Zayn’s involvement in the PLE still hangs in the balance.
