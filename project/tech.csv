Suicide: 'I want to have some dignity': Terminally ill US woman plans assisted death in Switzerland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-want-to-have-some-dignity-terminally-ill-us-woman-plans-assisted-death-in-switzerland/articleshow/113609990.cms,"A terminally ill woman from Missouri, US is preparing to travel to Switzerland for a physician-assisted death . Gayle Hendrix has been battling lupus and interstitial lung disease for four years and says her lung capacity is steadily worsening, leaving her eager to maintain control over her final moments.“I’ve had a great life, and I want to have some dignity when I’m going to the next phase,” Hendrix told 12 KFVS.She plans to make the journey with her daughter, Charlene Foeste, and end her life on September 26.Hendrix led an active lifestyle filled with hiking and travel but now struggles to breathe and must rely on an oxygen machine. She explains that her decision to travel to Switzerland stems from not wanting to wait until she is no longer physically able to make the journey.“I don’t want to get to the point of, ‘This is existing, not living,’” she said.The 79-year-old's decision has sparked difficult conversations within her family. Her daughter, Charlene, admits she doesn’t agree with her mother’s choice but feels it’s not her place to interfere. “It’s not my choice. I do love her and support her,” Foeste said. “There’s no way on the planet my mum is going to do this alone, no way.”Physician-assisted death is legal in 10 US states and Washington DC, but Hendrix chose Switzerland due to restrictive US regulations , which require patients to have less than six months to live. Hendrix believes waiting until she’s closer to death would rob her of control. “I don’t want to wait that long,” she said. “I don’t want to get that sick.”Hendrix has long been an advocate for assisted suicide . Her journey to Switzerland was delayed due to a lack of available appointments, but the process was eventually set in motion.Although some of Hendrix’s friends and family disagree with her decision, she remains determined. “I just am peaceful about my decision, and it’s the right thing for me and my body,” she said, as per Fox News.","Gayle Hendrix, 79, has been battling lupus and interstitial lung disease for four years.

Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the

Royal Family

OK!

Kate Middleton , the Princess of Wales, has become known not only for her grace in public but also for her remarkably effective parenting style. As Prince George , Princess Charlotte , and Prince Louis grow older and attend more public events, royal watchers have noted their impeccable behavior.However, when things do go awry, Kate uses a unique method to keep her children disciplined, often employing a simple but effective phrase:In his book, royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief, such as when Prince Louis made headlines during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee.During the event, Louis was seen sticking his tongue out at his mother, but rather than reacting harshly, Kate calmly used her signature phrase. According to Quinn, while seemingly harmless, these four words carry significant weight in the royal household. The children, understanding the cue, quickly fall back in line.Former staffers have praised Kate’s calm demeanour, noting that she prefers to let her children enjoy being kids and doesn’t overly stress about minor misbehavior. A source toldthat Kate ""doesn’t worry too much"" about her children’s behaviour and ""loves seeing them being kids."" Prince Louis, in particular, is described as an energetic child who occasionally struggles to contain his excitement during public engagements. However, his cheeky antics have often been met with humor by his parents, who even acknowledged them in a light-hearted thank-you note after the Jubilee.In contrast to more traditional approaches, the Prince and Princess of Wales prioritize open dialogue and a calm atmosphere at home. When one of their children experiences strong emotions or acts out, the royal couple opts for a ""sofa chat"" rather than isolating the child. This approach allows the children to process their feelings with guidance, rather than leaving them to manage their emotions alone. Notably, the couple adheres to a strict ""no shouting"" policy, ensuring a calm and nurturing environment even when discipline is necessary.William and Kate’s modern parenting methods, which blend discipline with empathy, continue to draw praise from experts and royal fans alike, reinforcing their image as dedicated and thoughtful parents.","Kate Middleton's signature phrase is: ""let's take a break"" royal expert Tom Quinn shed light on how the princess manages moments of mischief.

Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Explained: What is selfie authentication fraud and how to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-selfie-authentication-fraud-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/113568246.cms,"How does selfie authentication fraud work?

Tips to stay safe from selfie authentication fraud:

Selfie authentication is a security measure used by many online services to verify a user's identity by comparing a real-time photo of their face with a stored reference image. While this method can be convenient, it's also vulnerable to a new type of fraud known as selfie authentication fraud .1. Deepfakes: Malicious actors can create highly realistic deepfakes , which are synthetic media that can manipulate a person's appearance or voice.By using advanced AI techniques, they can generate fake selfies that closely resemble a legitimate user's face.2. Social engineering: Attackers may combine deepfakes with social engineering tactics to deceive online services. For instance, they might send a phishing email containing a link to a fake login page that asks for a selfie. When the victim uploads their photo, the attacker can capture it and use it to create a deepfake.3. Account takeover : Once the attacker has a deepfake of the victim's face, they can use it to bypass facial recognition security measures and gain unauthorised access to the victim's accounts.1. Be cautious of phishing attempts: Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. Never click on links in emails from unknown senders.2. Use strong passwords: In addition to facial recognition, use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password.4. Be mindful of social media privacy settings: Limit who can see your photos and posts on social media to reduce the risk of your images being used to create deepfakes.5. Report suspicious activity: If you suspect that your account has been compromised, contact the service provider immediately and report the incident.By following these tips, you can help protect yourself from selfie authentication fraud and safeguard your online accounts.","Selfie authentication is a security measure used by many online services to verify a user's identity.

The Bloodline civil war in WWE is getting heated up with each passing day. As per reports, Hikuleo , the cousin brother of Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, current members of the new Bloodline, has been added to NXTs internal roster.It’s unclear when he’ll be making his in-ring debut at this point in time, but there’s a high chance that he’ll be involved in the Bloodline storyline in some capacity once he finally makes his debut in front of the audience on the Gold brand.As reported by PWInsider, Hikuleo’s currently a part of WWE’s NXT roster, but his official debut hasn’t been confirmed yet. However, it’s not that he does not come without any wrestling experience at all. In fact, before being signed to the Gold brand, Hikuleo was a part of the New Japan Pro Wrestling promotion, and was their Open Strongweight Champion.He wrestled his last match for the promotion back in June this year, and since hasn’t been available on programming, which is likely because he was working on his transition into the WWE.It’s worth seeing what kind of an impact he’ll make once he’s finally made his debut on the show, and with WWE cracking TV deals left right and center, this is a wonderful opportunity for him to make an impression on fans.What’s more interesting and worth looking forward to, is which side he chooses to align with. Although it’s more likely that he’ll be aligning with his cousins Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, he could be aligning with Roman Reigns too.Either way, once the Bloodline Civil War ends, it’s likely that the stable will have an influence and a presence over all three shows in the future. With NXT filled with some amazing wrestlers like Shawn Spears and Ethan Page, Hikuleo is starting off in an amazing place and will be able to showcase his skills without much effort.Considering the skills that he brings to the table, he has the potential to be pushed to the main card in a short amount of time. It’ll be worth seeing how the creative team weaves their story around this new individual.","Hikuleo is the cousin brother of Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa, current members of the new Bloodline.
