What OpenAI says





Elon Musk-owned AI software company, xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI , accusing it of stealing its trade secrets. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in California, says that OpenAI was engaged in a “deeply troubling pattern” of hiring away former xAI employees to gain access to trade secrets. It further accuses OpenAI of pursuing unfair advantage in the AI race. In the lawsuit, xAI names four former engineers – Xuechen Li who is involved in a separate trade secrets lawsuit, Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive.“OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans, including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers, then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” the lawsuit states.“By hook or by crook, OpenAI clearly will do anything when threatened by a better innovator, including plundering and misappropriating the technical advancements, source code, and business plans of xAI,” the lawsuit claims.“OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor’s employees. OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans—including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers—then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” it states.OpenAI has rejected the allegations, dismissing the lawsuit as “the latest chapter in Mr. Musk’s ongoing harassment.”Notably, Elon Musk has had a complex relationship with OpenAI — from co-founding the company with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, to becoming one of its strongest critics and now a business rival.In August, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple, accusing Apple of giving ChatGPT preferential treatment in App Store rankings.Musk has also taken OpenAI to court, alleging it put profits ahead of its original mission of developing AI for humanity’s benefit. OpenAI, in turn, has countersued Musk, accusing him of harassment."," xAI has filed a lawsuit against Sam Altman-led OpenAI, accusing it of stealing its trade secrets.

World Retina Day: Doctor-approved tips for lifelong retinal health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/world-retina-day-doctor-approved-tips-for-lifelong-retinal-health/articleshow/124183692.cms,"The most common retinal diseases and who they affect



How to recognize early signs of retinal problems



Blurry or distorted vision

Difficulty with contrast or night vision

Straight lines appearing wavy or curved

Sudden appearance of floaters (tiny dark spots)

Flashes of light in your field of vision

Dark spots or shadows creeping into your sight

Lifestyle habits that protect retinal health



Load up on leafy greens like spinach and kale (rich in lutein and zeaxanthin)

Add colorful fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants

Eat omega-3-rich fish like salmon and sardines

Snack on nuts and seeds for vitamin E and healthy fats

Opt for whole grains to help regulate blood sugar

Lifestyle habits that protect your retina:

Control diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol – key risk factors for retinal disease

Quit smoking – a major risk factor for AMD

Wear UV-protective sunglasses – to shield against harmful sunlight

Exercise regularly – improves circulation and overall eye health

Limit screen time – to reduce strain and protect against myopia progression

The risks of delaying diagnosis or treatment



Are retinal issues common in children?



Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): More common as premature infants survive at higher rates.

Myopia epidemic: Rising rates of nearsightedness in children increase the risk of retinal thinning and detachment.

Eye trauma: Injuries from sports, accidents, or sharp objects can damage the retina.

Congenital conditions: Disorders like Marfan syndrome may predispose children to retinal problems.

Expert advice for maintaining retinal health



Key takeaways this World Retina Day



When you think about protecting your health, you probably picture your heart, lungs, or even your skin. But what about your eyes, specifically, your retina? The retina is the thin, light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye that allows you to see clearly. Without it, reading, driving, recognizing loved ones, or even navigating your daily life would be impossible.World Retina Day is a reminder that vision is precious, and retinal health deserves your attention. Across the United States, retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinal detachment are leading causes of vision loss. The good news? With early detection, lifestyle changes, and regular eye exams, many of these conditions can be managed or even prevented.We spoke to top eye specialists to understand the most common retinal diseases, how to spot early warning signs, and what Americans of all ages can do to protect their sight.According to Dr. Pawan Gupta, Senior Cataract and Retina Surgeon at Eye 7 Hospital and Vision Eye Clinic in New Delhi, the most frequently encountered retinal diseases include diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD): Primarily affects adults over age 50. This condition gradually damages the central part of the retina (the macula), making reading, driving, or recognizing faces difficult.Diabetic retinopathy (DR): Once mainly seen in people over 50, it is now affecting younger populations due to rising rates of diabetes in people in their 30s and 40s across the US.Retinal vein occlusion: More common in older adults, this occurs when retinal veins are blocked, leading to sudden vision changes.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): Found in premature infants, especially those with low birth weight.Dr. Shibal Bhartiya, Clinical Director of Ophthalmology at Marengo Asia Hospitals, adds that retinal detachment, while less common, can happen in younger individuals with high myopia (severe nearsightedness). “The sudden onset of flashes, floaters, or a shadow creeping across your vision is a medical emergency,” she stresses.In the US, these conditions disproportionately affect seniors, people living with diabetes, and children born prematurely. But with lifestyle changes and early screenings, risks can be managed.The scariest thing about retinal diseases is that many are silent in the early stages. You may not notice anything wrong until permanent damage has already occurred.According to experts, here are some red flags Americans should look out for:“Most people believe that if their vision is still good, their retina must be healthy,” says Dr. Gupta. “But early retinal diseases are often symptomless. Only a dilated eye exam can reveal them.”In the US, organizations like the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommend adults over 40 get baseline eye exams and more frequent screenings after age 50—or earlier if you have diabetes, hypertension, or a family history of eye disease.Your daily choices have a major impact on your eyes. A nutritious diet, exercise, and avoiding harmful habits can dramatically reduce your risk of retinal disease.Dietary tips for healthy eyes:“Once vision is lost from advanced retinal disease, it cannot be restored,” warns Dr. Rinky Anand Gupta of Max Super Speciality Hospital.Delaying treatment for retinal diseases can have devastating consequences.Diabetic retinopathy: By the time symptoms appear, vision loss is often permanent.AMD: Dry AMD can turn into wet AMD without warning, leading to rapid central vision loss.Retinal detachment: If untreated, can cause total blindness in the affected eye.Dr. Bhartiya emphasizes: “Once you lose your vision, it is irretrievable. Early detection can mean the difference between a lifetime of sight or permanent blindness.”In the US, many patients delay eye care because of cost, lack of awareness, or assuming they don’t need an eye exam unless vision worsens. But regular screenings are far cheaper—and far more effective—than late-stage treatment.Most retinal diseases affect adults, but children are not immune.According to Dr. Pawan Gupta, retinal issues in children include:Parents in the US should ensure children have regular pediatric eye exams, especially if they were born premature or spend long hours on screens. Outdoors playtime, protective eyewear for sports, and balanced nutrition are also crucial.So, what’s the one piece of advice doctors wish more Americans would follow?Dr. Gupta: “Get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Only a retinal specialist can detect problems early enough to prevent vision loss.”Dr. Bhartiya: “Don’t wait for symptoms. If you notice new floaters, flashes, or vision changes, seek urgent care.”Dr. Rinky Anand Gupta: “Healthy lifestyle habits, diet, exercise, avoiding smoking, are just as important as medical care.”In short: prevention, detection, and protection.Know the risks: Diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and age are all linked to retinal disease.Recognize the signs: Blurry vision, floaters, flashes, or distorted lines should never be ignored.Get screened regularly: Adults over 50 and anyone with risk factors should get annual dilated eye exams.Protect your kids: Encourage outdoor time, schedule routine eye checks, and protect against sports injuries.Make healthy choices: A nutrient-rich diet, exercise, and quitting smoking are powerful protectors of retinal health.On World Retina Day, let’s remember: our eyes deserve the same care we give to our heart or brain. Retinal diseases may be silent at first, but they are not unstoppable. By adopting healthy habits, getting regular eye exams, and seeking early treatment, Americans can preserve their sight for a lifetime.As Dr. Bhartiya wisely says: “Routine retinal care and timely treatment can be the difference between a lifetime of sight—or permanent blindness.”","The retina is the thin, light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye that allows you to see clearly.

UAE rolls out AI Platforms to boost Emirati employment and skills; What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-rolls-out-ai-platforms-to-boost-emirati-employment-and-skills-what-youneedtoknow/articleshow/124180514.cms,"UAE’s new AI Platforms aim to transform Emirati job market and close skills gaps

Massar Al Ghurair explained - AI job-matching, skills mapping and the partners behind it



Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform: A government pilot to streamline hiring and transparency

How the AI works and what that means for jobseekers

Policy, privacy and real-world outcomes

Faster matches, clearer training paths, and a test of governance





The UAE has recently introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities. Two headline moves are the Massar Al Ghurair platform (an AI job-matching and upskilling service launched by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation) and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform (a pilot rolled out by the Emirati Human Resources Development Council). Together they use labour-market intelligence, personalized skill-profiles and employer dashboards to make hiring, training and candidate discovery faster and more targeted.Massar Al Ghurair is an AI-powered skills and career platform built to help young nationals discover career paths, identify skills gaps and receive tailored upskilling recommendations plus direct job matches with participating employers. It was publicly launched earlier in 2025 with a live demo at Expo City Dubai. The platform was developed with SkyHive (now part of Cornerstone) and lists partners that include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Strategy& Middle East and Inception (a G42 company). These partnerships supply the cloud, analytics and AI tooling behind the personalized recommendations.Public reporting on the program states it aims to support tens of thousands of learners and connect them with dozens of employers and training providers; figures cited during coverage include targets such as 45,000 learners, 50 employers and 20 training partners in the initial rollouts.Launched as a pilot in late September 2025, the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform is designed to be an integrated recruitment and skills ecosystem for Emiratis: automated job recommendations, virtual interviews, interactive employer dashboards and real-time reporting on recruitment performance. The platform emphasizes transparency and governance in hiring and is intended to increase Emirati participation across strategic sectors. Unlike a single NGO or private platform, this government-backed tool aims to give regulators and employers a live view of candidate pipelines, responsiveness and sectoral gaps making it easier to coordinate training, quotas and incentives that support national workforce goals (including alignment with long-term strategies such as the UAE Centennial and national economic agendas).Both platforms share the same practical idea: turn raw CVs and course certificates into structured skill-profiles, then use labour-market data and AI to map those profiles to jobs and to recommended training. Practically this means a jobseeker can sign up, get a dynamic “skill passport,” see exactly which short courses or micro-credentials close a gap, and be surfaced to employers whose hiring criteria match their updated profile. Employers get dashboards showing candidate fit, time-to-hire and recruitment responsiveness useful for meeting Emiratisation targets.Quicker job discovery, personalized learning roadmaps, on-the-spot virtual interviews at job fairs, and clearer visibility on which skills local employers actually want. For employers, AI trims the search time and reduces mismatch by flagging candidates with the closest skill fit. Events such as Ru’ya Careers 2025 have already used advanced recruitment tools and on-site tech to connect Emiratis with thousands of roles, illustrating how these platforms will plug into existing hiring channels.If the platforms scale as planned they could materially speed up Emiratization by making training investments more targeted, reducing job-skills mismatch and helping small and large employers find suitable national candidates quickly. The combined NGO, private-sector and government approach also helps create a shared data backbone for workforce planning. AI recommendations are only as good as the data and assumptions behind them. Policymakers and platform teams will need to guard against biased matching, protect candidate data privacy, and ensure that automated shortlists don’t entrench new forms of exclusion. Coverage of related federal HR AI work shows the UAE is already moving fast on AI-driven HR tools but governance and transparency will determine public trust.The UAE’s new AI platforms are a pragmatic response to a well-known challenge: a fast-changing job market with new skills demanded each year. Massar Al Ghurair and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform together offer personalized guidance, employer connections and a data-driven way to scale Emiratization but their success will depend on how well they protect candidate data, avoid algorithmic bias, and convert AI leads into actual jobs and long-term career growth.","UAE has introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities.

Design solutions around faith based constraints





“Often we would want to optimize orientation to minimize the impact of the solar system and heat gain.”

“The entire western facade which is the one that experiences the highest number of solar gains is actually double fortified.”

Local materials and low-carbon innovations





A broader shift in Mosque architecture





A new milestone in sustainable architecture is underway in the UAE, where Masdar City, a sustainable urban development around 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from downtown Abu Dhabi, is constructing the world’s first mosque designed to operate on net-zero energy. Set for completion in October, the project integrates advanced sustainability technologies with heritage-inspired design, redefining how sacred spaces are built.Masdar City, globally known for its sustainable urban planning, has commenced construction on what will become the world’s first net-zero energy mosque—a religious structure that will produce as much energy as it consumes annually. This project marks the second mosque to be built in the city, following the Estidama Mosque, which was completed in 2023 and earned LEED Platinum certification for its use of solar panels, greywater recycling, and a sunken courtyard for passive temperature regulation.The new mosque spans a circular footprint of 1,595 square meters and is designed to accommodate more than 1,300 worshippers. The structure’s compact geometry helps reduce both thermal load and internal water usage. Smart sensors embedded in the building will monitor occupancy, temperature, and humidity, allowing fans and air conditioning systems to be activated only when necessary, significantly cutting energy and water consumption.A key goal of the project is to meet LEED Zero Carbon certification standards. Developed by Aldar and designed by Arup, the mosque will be powered entirely by on-site solar panels and include an array of passive design strategies that together are expected to reduce energy use by 35% and water consumption by 55% compared to conventional benchmarks.A unique challenge in designing the mosque was ensuring that the qibla wall—which must face Mecca as required by Islamic law—did not compromise the building’s energy efficiency. Unlike other structures that can be oriented for optimal solar performance, the mosque’s fixed directional alignment required innovative solutions.Paul Simmonite, Associate Director at Arup, explained:To address this limitation, the design team implemented strategies including angled windows, canopies, and high-performance wall insulation. One major intervention was the reinforcement of the western façade, which receives the most solar exposure. As Amna Al Zaabi, Senior Analyst on Masdar City’s design management team, noted:Passive cooling systems are central to the design. The interior spaces—including prayer halls, ablution areas, and circulation zones—have been carefully shaped to capture and direct soft breezes, reducing reliance on mechanical systems. A tiered rooftop window system aids natural ventilation while enhancing daylight access, further decreasing energy demands.In homage to the region’s architectural history, the mosque’s design draws direct inspiration from the Al Bidyah Mosque, the UAE’s oldest standing mosque built in the 15th century. This influence is reflected in the use of rammed earth walls, a rare technique in modern public buildings but historically significant in the UAE.The qibla wall, spanning 60 meters, is constructed using soil sourced from a nearby quarry. The choice of materials offers both symbolic and functional benefits: it allows the mosque to blend naturally with the desert environment while leveraging thermal mass to regulate indoor temperatures.Beyond the walls, Arup’s material strategy includes the use of low-emission concrete, sustainable prayer carpets, and energy-efficient lighting, targeting reductions in both embodied and operational emissions.The mosque also sets a regional first in material innovation through its use of hydrogen-based steel rebar, supplied in partnership with EMSTEEL. This makes it the first development in the MENA region to incorporate this low-carbon steel alternative. Initial assessments suggest this could cut structural emissions by up to 95%.The mosque reflects a broader shift in how sacred spaces are being designed in the UAE. There's a clear move toward modern, minimalist architecture that prioritizes sustainability without losing religious meaning.Despite its contemporary features, the mosque keeps core Islamic elements like the mihrab and minarets at the heart of its design.This change is also made possible by more flexible building regulations, giving architects room to merge tradition with innovation. The result is a worship space that’s modern, efficient, and still deeply connected to its purpose.","The mosque in Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City will generate 100% of its energy onsite using solar panels and passive cooling.

UAE market: pricing, trims and availability





Why it matters - buyer takeaways and the competition angle

Who should buy the 2025 Sportage?







The 2025 Kia Sportage arrives as a tech-forward compact SUV with a refined 2.5-litre petrol engine, a plug-in hybrid option, roomy interior comforts and a full slate of driver tech and it’s already available in the UAE with competitive pricing across trims. If you’re shopping the segment (CR-V, Tucson, RAV4), the Sportage now balances everyday usability with a proper PHEV option and strong in-car gadgetry.Kia’s petrol Sportage uses a 2.5-litre four-cylinder that produces 187 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired to an 8-speed automatic and offered in FWD or AWD setups, a reliable, predictable package for daily driving and highway cruising. For buyers seeking efficiency and short electric runs, Kia offers a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant that combines a 1.6-litre turbo engine with a 13 kWh battery for a combined output around 261 hp and an EPA-estimated all-electric range near 34 miles on the PHEV model. That PHEV powertrain gives the Sportage sharper acceleration and a meaningful zero-emissions commute for shorter trips.The Sportage is widely available across UAE dealers and online listings, with pricing that varies by engine, drivetrain and trim. Local market guides and dealers show a broad band for the 2025 Sportage roughly AED 103,000 to AED 149,000 depending on trim and drivetrain, while average online listings put the market price near AED 114,000 for commonly offered configurations.Dealers in Dubai and other emirates already list new and used 2025 Sportage units, so test drives and immediate delivery options are common for popular trims. If you prefer the PHEV, expect a premium over the petrol model but get the benefit of short all-electric trips and stronger combined performance.The Sportage’s strengths are clear: a well-measured petrol engine for everyday use, a competitive PHEV that answers buyers’ efficiency needs, roomy second-row comfort, and a tech stack that lifts its perceived value. Against rivals — Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4 the Sportage competes strongly on features and offers a more compelling electrified option for urban commuters. Production and supply moves (Kia is expanding hybrid production capacity globally) suggest continued availability of hybrid variants in coming years, which matters for buyers planning ownership and resale.If you want a compact SUV with modern cabin tech, generous rear passenger space and the option to cut short-trip emissions with a PHEV, the 2025 Sportage should be on your shortlist. Choose the petrol 2.5L for a straightforward, economical daily driver; pick the PHEV if you value electric-only city range and stronger combined performance. As always, take a test drive to compare ride feel across trims and confirm dealer specifications and warranty packages in the UAE.","The 2025 Kia Sportage arrives as a tech-forward compact SUV with a refined 2.5-litre petrol engine, a plug-in hybrid option, roomy interior comforts and a full slate of driver tech.

Dubai Police alert: Fake consumer protection sites targeting residents' personal and banking data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-police-alert-fake-consumer-protection-sites-targeting-residents-personal-and-banking-data/articleshow/124162613.cms,"Fraudsters create fake “Consumer Protection” websites, luring users into downloading malicious apps that mirror their screens and steal banking data/ Representative Image

About Dubai police Anti-Fraud Department







The Anti-Fraud Department at the General Department of Criminal Investigation in Dubai Police have issued an urgent warning about a new and growing online scam spreading through search engines and social media. Fraudsters are creating fake websites that impersonate official “Consumer Protection” platforms. By tricking victims into visiting these sites, scammers gain access to mobile data via malicious “remote access” applications, enabling them to carry out unauthorized financial transactions.Dubai Police explained that when a victim searches for a consumer protection platform to file a complaint, they may be misled into entering their personal details – such as name, email, phone number, and complaint description – on one of these fraudulent websites. The scammer then contacts the victim directly, posing as an official employee, and repeats the details of the complaint to appear credible.Once trust is established, the fraudster instructs the victim to download remote control software and simultaneously log in to their bank account. This allows the scammer to view the victim’s phone screen in real time, steal sensitive banking information, and carry out illegal transfers or purchases.Dubai Police stressed that these malicious applications are specifically designed to mirror the content of the victim’s device, granting full control to the fraudster. This exposes confidential data and enables its unlawful use.The force urged the public to only use official consumer protection channels, avoid downloading suspicious applications, and never share banking information with unauthorised parties.Dubai Police further urged immediate reporting of such attempts through the eCrime platform or by calling 901, to safeguard personal data and finances.The Anti-Fraud Department of Dubai Police was formally established as part of the General Department of Criminal Investigation to specifically combat financial crimes and scams. Over the past decade, it has grown into a sophisticated unit employing advanced forensic and digital technologies to track, investigate, and dismantle complex fraud networks, including cyber-enabled financial fraud, identity theft, and money laundering. This department uses biometric tools, data recovery, and international cooperation to tackle crimes, often involving high-value thefts such as gold and credit card scams.It also addresses emerging threats like AI-assisted fraud and fake online businesses, ensuring Dubai’s financial system remains secure by rapidly uncovering fraud schemes and arresting perpetrators. The department actively raises public awareness of fraud risks and encourages reporting to protect citizens and businesses alike.","Fraudsters create fake ‘Consumer Protection’ websites, luring users into downloading malicious apps that mirror their screens and steal banking data.

The UAE Media Council has reiterated its strict stance on the misuse of artificial intelligence in media content, especially in depictions involving national symbols or public figures. Amid growing global concerns around AI-generated misinformation, the Council is bolstering its regulatory framework to uphold ethical standards, preserve national identity, and ensure responsible digital communication.The UAE Media Council has clearly stated that using artificial intelligence (AI) or similar modern technologies to generate content involving national symbols or public figures without prior official approval is a direct violation of media content laws.This reminder comes in the wake of a recent social media incident where a user posted an AI-generated image featuring herself alongside the UAE’s founding father, Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan. The post drew strong criticism online, with many users calling it ""distasteful"" and “unnecessary.”According to the Media Council, such acts not only misrepresent public figures but also disrespect the nation’s identity and values.Violations of this nature fall under the UAE’s Media Violations Regulation and may result in fines and administrative penalties.In a formal advisory, the UAE Media Council warned all social media users, media entities, and content creators to adhere strictly to approved laws and standards when using digital tools and AI technologies.The Council outlined several key AI-related media offences, including:Such actions are classified as media offences and are punishable under the Media Violations Regulation.The Council also emphasised the importance of professional and ethical responsibility, particularly as the media landscape becomes increasingly shaped by generative technologies. This includes a clear directive that no AI-generated content involving national symbols can be published or circulated without prior official consent.In May 2025, the UAE Media Council signed a strategic agreement with Presight, a global AI-powered big data firm, to develop a new regulatory platform. This advanced system is designed to analyse and validate media content in real time, ensuring it complies with national values and legal standards before it reaches public audiences.The upcoming platform will:This initiative reflects the UAE's commitment to combining technological innovation with governance, allowing the media sector to evolve responsibly while safeguarding public discourse.During its third board meeting of 2025, chaired by Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Butti Al Hamed, the UAE Media Council reviewed a broad set of policy initiatives designed to regulate digital media and support local content creators.Key highlights from the meeting include:Al Hamed emphasised that these steps are part of a broader strategy to establish the UAE as a globally competitive media hub, driven by innovation and ethical standards.The regulatory push aligns with broader legal measures in the UAE. Under Article 1(17) of the Federal Decree Concerning Media Regulation, all forms of media are required to:Additionally, the UAE Charter for Responsible and Ethical Use of AI, released in June 2024, further outlines how AI should be used responsibly in line with national interests and social values.","The UAE Media Council has reiterated its strict stance on the misuse of artificial intelligence in media content.

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Enter your beneficiary ID, password, and captcha, then click 'Sign In.' To create and link your ABHA ID, hover your mouse over the 'Update' menu and click on ""Create/Link ABHA ID."" If you're creating an ABHA ID for family members, ensure each family member is mapped after the main cardholder logs in through the ""Beneficiary login."" Select ""I don’t have an ABHA number.""

You'll see the 'Link Status' option. If the details match, you can print the ABHA card by selecting 'print ABHA card.'

If you already have an ABHA number, follow these steps to link it with your CGHS beneficiary ID:

Log in to the CGHS website using your beneficiary ID and password, following the same process as mentioned above until Step 4. After Step 4, click on the 'Link Using ABHA Number' option and enter your ABHA number. Review the consent collection form carefully and provide your consent.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: OpenAI will be the next big multi-trillion-dollar company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-openai-will-be-the-next-big-multi-trillion-dollar-company/articleshow/124184094.cms,"“I think that OpenAI is likely going to be the next multi-trillion dollar hyperscale company,”

“the smartest investments we can possibly imagine.”

“at the chip level, at the software level, at the systems level.”

Read what Jensen Huang said about Nvidia’s partnership with OpenAI



“I think that OpenAI is likely going to be the next multi- trillion dollar hypers scale company like Meta and Google. They're going to have consumer and enterprise services… if that's the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there, this is some of the smartest investments we can possibly imagine. We happen to know this space. So the opportunity to invest in that… the return on that money is going to be fantastic.

Let me start from the beginning. We’re partnering with OpenAI in several projects. The first project is the buildout of Microsoft Azure, and that partnership is going fantastically. We have several years of buildout to do, hundreds of billions of dollars of work just in that area alone. The second is the OCI buildout — there are five, six, seven gigawatts about to be built, and we’re working with OCI, OpenAI, and SoftBank to make that happen. These projects are already contracted, and we’re executing on them.

The third is CoreWeave — and again, I’m talking about OpenAI in all of this. The new partnership is about helping OpenAI build their own self-built AI infrastructure for the first time. We’re working directly with them at the chip level, the software level, the systems level, and the AI factory level to help them become a fully operated hyperscale company.

This is going to continue for some time. They’re going through two exponentials right now. The first exponential is customers — the number of customers is growing exponentially because the AI is getting better, the use cases are getting better, and just about every application is connected to OpenAI. The second exponential is compute — instead of just one-shot inference, the models are now thinking before they answer. Those two exponentials are compounding, and that’s driving enormous compute requirements.

So we’ve got to build out all these different projects. And this new partnership is additive, on top of everything already announced, and it’s going to support this incredible exponential growth.”

“They want to have a relationship with us the way Elon and X has.”

“I think they’ll likely use it themselves, and just think the case of X. But they would like to have the same direct relationship with us — direct working relationship and direct purchasing relationship. Just as with Zuck and Meta, Sundar and Google and Satya and Azure have.

So they’ve [OpenAI] gotten to a large enough scale that they believe it’s time for them to start building these direct relationships. So, I’m delighted to support that, and Satya knows it, and Larry knows it, and everybody’s aware of what’s going on, and everybody’s very supportive of it.”

Google shows Donald Trump when you search “idiot”? Sundar Pichai explains the reason why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-shows-donald-trump-when-you-search-idiot-sundar-pichai-explains-the-reason-why/articleshow/124178230.cms,"Sundar Pichai explains how Google’s algorithm show Donald Trump on searching ‘idiot’

Political claims and context

Lessons from past precedents





A seemingly strange search result on Google , where typing the word “idiot” returned images of former President Donald Trump , sparked widespread speculation about political bias and algorithm manipulation. Google CEO Sundar Pichai clarified that this outcome was not the result of any manual interference or partisan intent. Instead, it emerged from how Google’s search algorithm interprets billions of web pages and user interactions. The system prioritizes relevance, popularity, and how users collectively associate terms online. In this case, coordinated online activity and repeated linking of Trump’s images with the word “idiot” caused the algorithm to surface those results, demonstrating the power of user behavior in shaping search outcomes.Google indexes and ranks web content using over 200 factors, including relevance, freshness, and user engagement. Pichai emphasized that no staff member manually selects search results. The algorithm works automatically, analyzing patterns in how keywords and content are connected across the web. When enough users link specific terms with certain pages or images, those connections influence what appears in search results.The Trump “idiot” result was largely driven by a phenomenon called “Google bombing.” Online communities, particularly on forums like Reddit, intentionally linked Trump’s images with the word “idiot,” increasing the frequency and interconnectedness of that association. Google’s algorithm detected this pattern and ranked the results accordingly. This practice is an example of how collective online behavior can influence search outcomes without any intervention from the company.The search result became a political flashpoint, with President Trump accusing Google of search bias, algorithm manipulation, and censorship. Investigations by regulators and independent experts found no evidence of deliberate manipulation by Google. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated that search outcomes reflect organic trends, search engine algorithms, and user activity rather than company-driven agendas or political influence. Similar controversies have occurred in the past, including manipulated search trends and results—like searches for “miserable failure” returning images of President George W. Bush—driven entirely by user behavior, SEO tactics, and keyword associations.The incident illustrates the complex interaction between algorithms and human behavior. Algorithms prioritize content that is most linked, shared, or relevant according to user activity, regardless of context. High-profile cases like the Trump or Bush examples show that coordinated online behavior can dramatically affect search results, highlighting the broader influence of digital communities on information visibility.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai explains how Google’s algorithm show Donald Trump on searching ‘idiot’ The result became a political flashpoint, with President Trump accusing Google of search bias, algorithm manipulation, and censorship.

My favourite ChatGPT feature so far: Sam Altman introduces user insights tool Pulse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/my-favourite-chatgpt-feature-so-far-sam-altman-introduces-user-insights-tool-pulse/articleshow/124164625.cms,"Representative Image

What Sam Altman said about ChatGPT’s new Pulse tool



“Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.

It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention “I’d like to go visit Bora Bora someday” or “My kid is 6 months old and I’m interested in developmental milestones” and in the future you might get useful updates.

Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.

This also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.

This is an early look, and right now only available to Pro subscribers. We will work hard to improve the quality over time and to find a way to bring it to Plus subscribers too.

Huge congrats to @ChristinaHartW, @_samirism, and the team for building this.”

""Pulse is just the beginning. Over time, ChatGPT will evolve from something you consult into something that quietly accelerates the work and ideas that matter to you,”

"Apple responds to lawsuit over delayed Siri features, says ‘limited delay cannot support sweeping claims’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-responds-to-lawsuit-over-delayed-siri-features-says-limited-delay-cannot-support-sweeping-claims/articleshow/124162390.cms,"The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think

Apple’s response to the lawsuit over delayed Siri features





Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features, reports MacRumours citing court documents reviewed by it. The lawsuit claims that Apple misled customers with marketing for the iPhone 16, which promoted upcoming Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence. Plaintiffs said they would not have purchased the iPhone 16, or would have paid less, if they had known the features would be delayed.The case, Landsheft v. Apple Inc., is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.Apple’s lawyers argued that the lawsuit is unfounded because only two Siri features—contextual awareness and in-app controls—were delayed. “Plaintiffs complain about the timing of release of two features, despite the near-two dozen Apple Intelligence features that have already been delivered,” the lawyers said. “This limited delay cannot support Plaintiffs' sweeping claims.”The lawyers also said the delayed features do not amount to a breach of warranty.“By purchasing an iPhone 16, all of the plaintiffs have benefitted from camera improvements, enhanced silicon and increased performance, upgraded displays, and numerous other hardware and software improvements, including more than 20 Apple Intelligence features that were already available prior to the lawsuit,” they added.Apple first announced the personalized Siri features at its WWDC 2024 keynote, highlighting better understanding of a user’s personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. The company later said in March that the features would be delayed, with CEO Tim Cook noting in July that Apple was “making good progress” and aimed to release them “next year.”Apple advertised the features through product presentations, its website, and a TV commercial featuring actor Bella Ramsey. The company is reportedly planning to release the features in iOS 26.4, expected in March or April 2026.","Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features.
