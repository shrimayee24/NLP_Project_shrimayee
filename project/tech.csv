How Vance swayed Trump

Hillbilly Elegy,

How tall is Barron Trump?



As J.D. Vance steps into the spotlight as former President Donald Trump 's running mate in the 2024 election, various details about his life are coming under scrutiny, including his height.Initial Google search results incorrectly listed Vance's height as 5'7"", which seemed notably inaccurate given his stature compared to his Senate colleagues. To clarify, a campaign official released a photo of Vance standing next to former President Trump, who is listed as 6'3"" by his White House physician.Vance is almost as tall Trump and is at least 6’2’’.This isn't the first instance of online search results misrepresenting the height of a prominent political figure. Vice President Kamala Harris expressed frustration in an interview with Katie Couric about her Wikipedia entry listing her as 5'2"".""That is absolutely incorrect. I am 5’4″ and a quarter,"" Harris corrected. ""They just want to make us smaller in every way,"" she added, noting she reaches 5'7"" and a half in heels.If elected, Vance would be the tallest vice president in recent history. For comparison, former Vice President Mike Pence is 5′10″, President Joe Biden, former Vice President under Barack Obama, is 6′0″, former Vice President Dick Cheney is 5′8″, and former Vice President Al Gore is 6'1″.On a warm winter afternoon in February 2021, J.D. Vance walked into Donald Trump's office at Mar-a-Lago. Trump had a thick stack of papers on his desk: printouts of Vance's numerous criticisms of him, including an essay in The Atlantic where Vance had described Trump as ""cultural heroin,"" offering false promises to the white working class.Trump bluntly confronted Vance, using an expletive to express his displeasure about the ""nasty stuff"" Vance had said. This discussion, detailed by two sources who insisted on anonymity, was a critical moment for Vance.Meeting Trump for the first time, Vance needed to make a good impression or at least ensure Trump left with an open mind. Vance, author of the best-selling memoirwas running for the U.S. Senate seat in Ohio as a Republican populist. Previously a Never Trumper, he was now seeking Trump's endorsement.Vance chose to apologize immediately. He admitted to Trump that he had bought into media lies and expressed regret for his past remarks. He acknowledged that he, of all people, should have understood Trump's appeal.Trump agreed, noting that Vance, having written ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" should have supported him. Trump implied that Vance's book, which focused on the struggles of the white working class, aligned with the sentiments of Trump's base—non-college-educated voters angry about globalization, immigration, and foreign wars.Barron Trump's height has been a topic of debate , even within his family. Donald Trump has mentioned different figures, sometimes claiming Barron is 6 feet 7 inches tall and other times 6 feet 8 inches. These variations might be due to differences in measurement methods, but it's also notable given Donald Trump's history of exaggerating his own height. Whether he's boasting, downplaying, or genuinely uncertain about Barron's height, the fact remains that Barron is exceptionally tall. His mother Melania Trump is 5 feet 11 inches tall.","J.D.

How tall is he exactly?

Is he the tallest child of a US President?

Where is he going to college?

Barron Trump , the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently drawn attention due to his remarkable height. Photographed at his maternal grandmother’s funeral recently, the now-17-year-old's stature was striking, highlighting just how much he has grown. For those who haven't been following Barron closely, this recent appearance might come as a surprise, prompting comments like, “Man, that kid shot up like a weed!”The exact height of Barron Trump is a topic of some debate, even within his own family.Donald Trump has mentioned different figures, claiming at various times that Barron is either 6 feet, 7 inches or 6 feet, 8 inches tall. This variation might be due to differences in measurement methods, but it’s also notable given Donald Trump's history of exaggerating his own height. Whether he’s boasting, downplaying, or genuinely uncertain about Barron’s height, the fact remains that Barron is exceptionally tall.Given his impressive stature, Barron might hold a unique place in history as the tallest child of a U.S. president. Historically, presidential children’s heights were not meticulously recorded, making it difficult to confirm if Barron holds the record. For instance, while Abraham Lincoln was the tallest president at 6 feet, 4 inches, there is little information about the height of his son, Robert Lincoln. Similarly, no records detail the heights of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s sons or other presidential offspring. Peter Kastor, a professor specializing in presidential history at Washington University in St. Louis, notes that records of presidents' heights are sparse, let alone those of their children.Reports on Donald Trump’s reaction to Barron’s height are mixed. Trump's frequent mentions of Barron’s height suggest a sense of pride. For example, when discussing Barron’s recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, Trump affectionately referred to him as “My Barron. My tall Barron. He’s very tall. My beautiful Barron.” However, there are also anecdotes suggesting that Trump might feel some jealousy. Michael Wolff’s 2019 book mentions Trump being envious of Barron’s height when he was just 12 years old.Earlier reports suggested that Barron might attend the University of Pennsylvania, following in his father's footsteps at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. He was also considering New York University. However, a recent TikTok post indicates that Barron is keeping his options open and might even take a gap year, given the significant developments in his family's life. Donald Trump recently praised his son, saying, ""He's tall, good-looking... a very good student. He's applied to colleges and gets into everywhere he goes. He's very sought after because he's a very smart guy, a very tall guy, and a great kid.""","Barron Trump, the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently drawn attention due to his remarkable height.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system. This update enables access to the NPS central record-keeping agency (CRA) system through two-factor authentication.Here's how to log in to NPS using 2-factor authentication:1. Visit the NPS website: https://enps.nsdl.com/eNPS/NationalPensionSystem.html2. Click on 'Login with PRAIN/IPIN.'3. Select the PRAIN/IPIN tab, and a new window will open.4. Enter your user ID and password.5. Complete the Captcha verification.6. A window will prompt for Aadhaar authentication and send an OTP.7. Enter the OTP received on your registered mobile number.8. Submit the OTP.To bolster security and protect the interests of subscribers and stakeholders, the CRA system will now use Aadhaar-based authentication for login. This authentication method will be integrated with the existing User ID and Password login system, enabling 2-factor authentication to access the CRA system.Government sector nodal offices can employ Aadhaar OTP for 2-factor authentication on the CRA and NPSCAN systems. To begin Aadhaar Mapping, the Oversight Office (PrAO/DTA) must initially link Aadhaar with the respective CRA User ID. PAO/DTOs must also link their Aadhaar with their CRA User ID to enable DDOs to initiate Aadhaar linkage.Government and autonomous bodies are required to implement Aadhaar-based login and authentication within the CRA system for NPS operations.","The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Safety measures in GPT-4o mini

Sam Altman-led OpenAI has launched a new cost-efficient small AI model . Dubbed GPT-4o mini , it is 60% cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo. GPT 4o-mini is priced at 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens.In a press release, the Microsoft-backed company said that the new GPT-4o mini can outperform GPT-41 on chat preferences in LMSYS leaderboard.It scored 82% on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), OpenAI said.OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini enables a broad range of tasks, such as applications that chain or parallelize multiple model calls (e.g., calling multiple APIs), pass a large volume of context to the model (e.g., full code base or conversation history), or interact with customers through fast, real-time text responses (e.g., customer support chatbots).Currently, GPT-4o mini supports text and vision in the API. The company plans to add support for text, image, video and audio inputs and outputs in the future.According to OpenAI, GPT 4o-mini scored 87.0%, compared to 75.5% for Gemini Flash and 71.7% for Claude Haiku in math reasoning. Similarly, GPT-4o mini scored 87.2% on HumanEval, which measures coding performance, compared to 71.5% for Gemini Flash and 75.9% for Claude Haiku.GPT-4o mini is available as a text and vision model in the Assistants API, Chat Completions API, and Batch API. Developers pay 15 cents per 1M input tokens and 60 cents per 1M output tokens (roughly the equivalent of 2500 pages in a standard book).In ChatGPT , Free, Plus and Team users will be able to access GPT-4o mini starting today, in place of GPT-3.5. Enterprise users will also have access starting next week.OpenAI says that the GPT-4o mini has the same safety mitigations built-in as GPT-4o. More than 70 external experts in fields like social psychology and misinformation tested GPT-4o to identify potential risks. Insights from these expert evaluations, the company says, have helped improve the safety of both GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.",GPT-4o mini can outperform GPT-41 on chat preferences in LMSYS leaderboard.

Japanese scientists have achieved a significant milestone by attaching living skin tissue to robotic faces, enabling them to ""smile."" This groundbreaking development, spearheaded by researchers at the University of Tokyo, holds promise for applications in both cosmetics and medicine.A Reuters report states that scientists at the University of Tokyo successfully cultivated human skin cells in the form of a face and used embedded ligament-like attachments to create a wide smile.The result, although slightly uncanny, represents a crucial step towards creating more lifelike robots, according to lead researcher Shoji Takeuchi.""By attaching these actuators and anchors, it became possible to manipulate living skin for the first time,"" Takeuchi explained.The smiling robot , which features in a study published last month in Cell Reports Physical Science, is the culmination of a decade of research by Takeuchi and his team. Their work focuses on integrating biological and artificial components to create more realistic machines.Takeuchi highlighted the numerous advantages of using living tissue over traditional materials like metals and plastics. Living tissue offers energy efficiency comparable to that of brains and muscles and has the inherent ability to repair itself, unlike synthetic materials.Looking ahead, the researchers plan to enhance the lab-grown skin by incorporating additional elements such as a circulatory system and nerves. These developments could pave the way for safer testing platforms for cosmetics and medications that are absorbed through the skin. Moreover, it could result in more realistic and functional coverings for robots.Despite the progress, there remains the challenge of addressing the eerie or unsettling feelings that lifelike machines can evoke. Takeuchi acknowledged the current creepiness factor of the robot but believes that making robots out of human-like materials and enabling them to display human expressions might help overcome the ""uncanny valley"" effect.""There's still a bit of that creepiness to it,"" Takeuchi admitted. ""I think that making robots out of the same materials as humans and having them show the same expressions might be one key to overcoming the uncanny valley.""",Scientists at the University of Tokyo successfully cultivated human skin cells in the form of a face and used embedded ligament-like attachments to create a wide smile.

Bharti Airtel has unveiled new 5G data booster packs for its customers, offering unlimited 5G data for users on 1GB per day and 1.5GB per day plans, which previously did not include this benefit. This initiative follows a similar launch by Reliance Jio and aims to enhance the data experience for Airtel's customer base.Airtel's new booster packs are available in three tiers, priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151.These packs provide additional 3GB, 6GB, and 9GB of 4G data respectively, alongside unlimited 5G data. The booster packs can be activated on existing plans and will share the same validity period as the base plan. For instance, if a customer has a 56-day plan, the booster pack will also be valid for 56 days.Users can add these boosters to their existing plans to access unlimited 5G data, guaranteeing sufficient data for work, study, entertainment, and other activities. The introduction of these boosters aims to offer a seamless and enhanced data experience, particularly for users who rely heavily on data for their daily activities.Airtel's launch of these booster packs closely follows Reliance Jio's introduction of similar plans. Jio's booster packs also provide unlimited 5G data and are similarly priced. However, Jio's plans come with certain limitations, such as incompatibility with specific value plans. Airtel, on the other hand, has not specified any such limitations for its booster packs, potentially offering a more flexible option for users.The launch of these booster packs comes on the heels of recent tariff hikes by both Airtel and Jio, which took effect from July 3. Airtel emphasised the need for a higher Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) to maintain a sustainable business model and continue investing in network technology and spectrum. The revised unlimited voice plans saw tariffs increase from Rs 179 to Rs 199, Rs 455 to Rs 599, and Rs 1,799 to Rs 1,999. Airtel described this as a modest hike, equating to less than 70 paise per day for entry-level plans, to minimise the impact on budget-conscious consumers. Vodafone-Idea (Vi) has also increased prices for its prepaid and postpaid plans.","Airtel's new booster packs are available in three tiers, priced at Rs 51, Rs 101, and Rs 151.

Facebook parent company Meta has said that it will not launch its upcoming multimodal AI model Llama in the European Union ( EU ). The company said that the region’s regulations have an “unpredictable nature”, making it the second big technology company after Apple to make such a decision.This means that European companies and users will not be able to use the multimodal model – which is capable of using video, audio, images and text to generate responses – despite it being released under an open licence.This means that it can be freely downloaded and adapted by users.“We will release a multimodal Llama model over the coming months, but not in the EU due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment,” Meta spokesperson Kate McLaughlin told The Verge.In May, Meta updated its policy, saying that it will use publicly available user data, including photos, videos and posts, to train its AI model. However, last month, the company was ordered to stop training its AI models with such content as it may violate privacy rules.Meta has also paused plans to release its AI assistant in the EU as well as generative AI tools in Brazil due to concerns raised about data protection compliance.Meta’s decision follows a similar move by Apple, which said that it plans to exclude the EU from the rollout of AI features under Apple Intelligence due to concerns surrounding the Digital Markets Act .The features that are reportedly getting delayed are Apple Intelligence (think super-smart Siri) and iPhone Mirroring (showing your phone screen on your Mac) among others. These are set to launch with the next big iPhone update coming later in 2024.Apple pointed fingers at the Digital Markets Act (DMA), saying that the company is “concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products.”","Facebook parent company Meta has said that it will not launch its upcoming multimodal AI model Llama in the European Union ( EU ) The company said that the region’s regulations have an “unpredictable nature”, making it the second big technology company after Apple to make such a decision.
