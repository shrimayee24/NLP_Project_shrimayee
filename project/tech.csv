What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar Vembu said Sarvam AI's work shows that ‘world-class AI’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

"A decade in the wild: Namma ‘Tarzan’ makes forest his home, lives on leaves in Karnataka",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/a-decade-in-the-wild-namma-tarzan-makes-forest-his-home-lives-on-leaves/articleshow/128358820.cms,"BELAGAVI: On a scrubby, wind-beaten stretch of rocky hills near Ugargol village in Saundatti taluk, a lean, bare-chested figure moves with practised ease. For nearly a decade, Budan Khan Hosamani has called the forested slopes of Heggolla home — claiming to have survived on raw leaves and wild greens, far from the prying eyes of civil society.Locals have christened the 34-year-old the ""Modern-Day Tarzan"", a comparison inspired by his muscular build, minimal clothing and apparent comfort in the wild. The analogy may be a touch dramatic — there are no jungle vines or cinematic leaps here — but Budan's life in the forest undeniably set him apart.""I like living in the forest, not in public,"" he says.Budan claims to have spent the past 10 years in the hills, sustaining himself on nearly 80 varieties of edible leaves and plants endemic to the region. He insists he does not eat cooked food, rice or roti, and no longer finds conventional meals appealing.His daily routine includes long walks, yoga and exercise — practices he credits for helping him digest raw vegetation.His unusual diet, he says, was learned from observing monkeys. ""I watched what they eat and what they avoid,"" Budan explains. Studying their habits, he claims, helped him identify safe leaves and steer clear of harmful ones.Residents of Ugargol recall that Budan left home about a decade ago. His mother and two brothers still live in the village. ""I told my mother, I won't come home,"" he says, adding that he left home when relatives pressured him to get married. Though the family later let him have his way, he had, by then, adapted fully to a sylvan life.Despite living in isolation, a mobile phone is one gadget that Budan has kept with himself for emergencies.In the end, whether modern-day Tarzan or solitary seeker, Budan remains a man who chose the wild — and has stayed his course.","Budan Khan Hosamani has lived in the forested slopes of Heggolla for nearly a decade.

NEW DELHI: From anti-drone systems to 100-odd police personnel at each of the 10 hotels housing VIPs and 5,000 traffic cops, a G20-like security apparatus is being put in place for the five-day AI (Artificial Intelligence) Impact Summit beginning at Bharat Mandapam Monday.Sources said a robust air defence setup, including five anti-drone systems, would guard the venue. They are designed to detect, track and neutralise drones in real time. Multiple air defence guns will also be deployed. Similar systems were in place for the world leaders' G20 summit at the same venue in Sept 2023.The venue will be equipped with more than 500 CCTV cameras, most of them featuring advanced video analytics, including facial recognition technology linked to a comprehensive criminal database and an automatic numberplate recognition system integrated with a database of stolen or suspicious vehicles. Additional capabilities, such as intrusion detection and suspect object identification, are also being incorporated to strengthen overall security. Inside, a mini control room will be set up to monitor suspicious activity. It will have control over all CCTV feeds and can directly alert police personnel, allowing immediate action, if necessary.The venue will also have 20-25 anti-sabotage teams, along with bomb detection and disposal squads, to conduct continuous security sweeps.These teams are already inspecting every nook and corner of the site, as well as surrounding areas, to detect and neutralise any potential risk. Five teams of the NDRF will be deployed to tackle any kind of disaster, and two teams have been kept in reserve.Steps are also being taken to ensure no protests or demonstrations are held around the venue. Twenty-five teams with wireless sets and buses will coordinate, and if there is any chance of a gathering, they will immediately reach the spot and detain the protesters.Sources said guests would be accommodated at 10 hotels in and around the city. Each hotel will be placed under the supervision of a senior DCP-rank officer, who will be responsible for overseeing all security arrangements at the property.“To support the officer, a team of approximately 100 personnel will be deployed at each hotel. This staff will manage entry and exit points, and monitor guest movements,” a source said.As the event is being held at the time of school examinations, police have been asked to assist students if they getstuck in congestion or roadblocks. “If students risk being late for their exams, cops will take steps to transport them safely and promptly to their respective examination centres. Nodal officers have been appointed to ensure smooth coordination and effective management of such situations,” a senior officer said.Around 5,000 traffic police personnel will be deployed to manage the high-security arrangements during the event. Additional commissioner of police (traffic) Dinesh Gupta said that81 vehicles, 3,000 light bars and 250 wireless sets had been procured to strengthen traffic management.","The five-day AI (Artificial Intelligence) Impact Summit begins at Bharat Mandapam Monday.

When Steve Jobs got Google logo changed; told Google: I don't like the way...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-got-google-logo-changed-told-google-i-dont-like-the-way-/articleshow/128371974.cms,"Back in January 2008, Steve Jobs called Google's Vic Gundotra on a Sunday morning—while Gundotra was in church—to complain that the second 'O' in Google's iPhone icon had the wrong yellow gradient. Jobs had already assigned an Apple engineer to fix it by Monday.

Steve Jobs' obsession with pixel-perfect design extended even to other companies' logos on his device

The anecdote only became public three years later, as a tribute to Jobs

It was a Sunday morning in January 2008. Vic Gundotra, then Google's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was sitting in church with his family when his phone buzzed with an unknown number. He let it ring. Minutes later, he checked his voicemail—it was Steve Jobs , saying he had something ""urgent"" to discuss. Gundotra called back almost immediately. Jobs opened with a joke—""Vic, unless the Caller ID said 'GOD', you should never pick up during services""—before getting to the point.The issue? The second 'O' in the Google logo on the iPhone 's home screen didn't have the right yellow gradient. Jobs had been studying the icon and found the colour rendering off. He'd already assigned Greg Christie, Apple 's Senior Director of Human Interface, to help fix it by Monday morning.This wasn't about Google's global branding. The corporate logo stayed exactly as it was. What bothered Jobs was how the icon rendered specifically on the iPhone's display—a subtle calibration mismatch that most people would never notice. But Jobs wasn't most people.Christie promptly emailed Gundotra with the subject line ""Icon Ambulance,"" attaching corrected gradient files. Google implemented the tweak without fuss.At the time, Apple and Google were close partners—Google Maps and YouTube came pre-installed on the iPhone—and the exchange reflected a working relationship built on mutual respect rather than the rivalry that would develop later.Gundotra kept the story private until August 25, 2011—the day after Jobs resigned as Apple CEO due to declining health. He shared it on Google+ under the title ""Icon Ambulance,"" framing it as a lesson in leadership.""CEOs should care about details. Even shades of yellow. On a Sunday,"" Gundotra wrote.It remains one of the most enduring stories about Jobs—not because of what he built, but because of how closely he looked at everything on screen. Over the years, it's been retold in Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs and cited in countless discussions about design philosophy and product leadership.","Steve Jobs called Google's Vic Gundotra while he was in church in January 2008.

Q: How can I start career cushioning?

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

"UAE issues 25 new AI guidelines for schools, prohibits use for under-13 students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-issues-25-new-ai-guidelines-for-schools-prohibits-use-for-under-13-students/articleshow/128371457.cms,"UAE tightens AI rules in schools: ban under 13s, protect academic integrity / Image: file

UAE's new AI school policy

Using AI during formal examinations or official assessments is completely banned.

Students cannot submit AI-generated assignments, essays, or projects as their own work. Any use of AI must be explicitly disclosed and approved by a teacher beforehand.

Simply rephrasing what a bot says isn't enough. Students must demonstrate a genuine personal understanding of the content. If a student cannot explain the ""why"" behind an AI-assisted answer, it’s a violation.

UAE's strict content controls

Violent or psychologically disturbing imagery.

Hate speech, discrimination, or misinformation.

Promotions of unsafe or illegal behavior, such as cyberbullying or substance abuse.

""Deepfakes"" or any content intended to impersonate others or spread false rumors.

Data privacy in UAE schools

The future





The UAE has officially drawn a line in the digital sand. As artificial intelligence becomes as common as a calculator, the Ministry of Education has released the ""Safe and Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms 2026"" guide.This comprehensive framework introduces 25 specific prohibitions designed to ensure that while students learn about the future, they don’t lose their ability to think for themselves today.The most significant change is a firm age limit. Students under the age of 13, or those enrolled in any grade below Year 7 (Grade 6), are now strictly prohibited from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT.The Ministry’s reasoning is clear: early education must be built on human interaction, tactile creativity, and independent problem-solving. By keeping AI out of primary classrooms, the government aims to prevent younger learners from developing a ""digital crutch"" before they have mastered the fundamentals of critical thinking and social-emotional skills.For older students who are permitted to use AI, the rules are rigorous. The Ministry has made it clear that AI is a ""tutor,"" not a ""ghostwriter.""The UAE is ensuring that AI tools reflect the country’s unique cultural fabric.The guidelines prohibit creating or sharing any AI content that contradicts Islamic values, national identity, or cultural ethics.Beyond cultural safeguards, the rules ban AI-generated material that includes:In an era of data harvesting, the Ministry has turned schools into a ""data fortress."" There is a total ban on uploading personal information, including names, photos, audio recordings, or ID details, of students, teachers, or parents into any AI platform.Furthermore, schools are prohibited from using unapproved AI services. This means no bypassing school firewalls with VPNs and no creating student accounts on external platforms that require personal data without official Ministry clearance. Even recording or transcribing a classroom discussion using AI now requires the explicit consent of everyone in the room.The ministry’s manual reinforces that AI should function as a support tool, not a shortcut. Students must critically review and verify AI-generated content before using it in their work, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Teachers are expected to guide students on ethical AI practices and help them understand both the capabilities and limitations of generative tools.While these rules seem strict, they aren't about fearing technology, they’re about mastering it. Starting in the 2025-2026 academic year, the UAE is making AI a mandatory subject from Kindergarten to Grade 12.Taught by over 1,000 specially trained educators, this curriculum focuses on the ethics and mechanics of AI. The goal is to graduate a generation that doesn't just know how to prompt a bot, but understands the algorithms, data privacy, and ethical responsibilities that power the modern world.In the UAE, the message is loud and clear: technology will support the teacher, but it will never replace the human mind.","UAE bans under 13s from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT in schools.

‘No discussions for specific operations’: Anthropic denies Claude’s use by US military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-discussions-for-specific-operations-anthropic-denies-claudes-use-by-us-military/articleshow/128370317.cms,".





AI firm Anthropic has stated that it has not held discussions with the US's department of war regarding the use of its AI system, Claude, for specific operations.""Anthropic has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war,"" the AI firm said, as cited by Reuters.Meanwhile, the Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its relationship with Anthropic over the company’s restrictions on how its models are used, Axios reported on Saturday, citing a senior administration official.The US military has asked four leading AI labs to allow the use of their tools for “all lawful purposes,” including sensitive areas such as weapons development, intelligence gathering, and battlefield operations. Anthropic has not agreed to these terms, leading to mounting frustration within the Pentagon after months of difficult negotiations.Anthropic has maintained that two areas must remain off-limits: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weaponry. A senior administration official noted that there is significant ambiguity over what falls within these categories, making it impractical for the Pentagon to negotiate individual use cases with Anthropic or risk the AI system, Claude, unexpectedly blocking certain applications.Tensions between the Pentagon and Anthropic escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported that the US military used Anthropic’s artificial intelligence model, Claude, during the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Claude was reportedly deployed as part of Anthropic’s collaboration with data analytics company Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are extensively used by the US department of defence and federal law enforcement agencies.In early January, US forces captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife during strikes on multiple sites in Caracas, and Maduro was flown to New York to face federal drug trafficking charges.Anthropic’s usage policies explicitly prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons, or conduct surveillance. The Wall Street Journal reports that the AI model was involved in a raid that included bombing operation, whichs has drawn attention to how artificial intelligence tools are being deployed in military contexts and whether existing safeguards are effective.According to the report, disagreements over the Pentagon’s desired use of Claude have contributed to growing tensions between the AI firm and US defence officials, with some administration officials considering cancelling a contract worth up to $200 million.Anthropic was reportedly the first AI developer whose model was used in classified operations by the department of defence, though it remains unclear whether other AI systems were used in the Venezuela mission for unclassified tasks.Claude is an advanced artificial intelligence chatbot and large language model developed by US-based AI company Anthropic. Designed for tasks such as text generation, reasoning, coding, and data analysis, Claude competes with other large language models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.The system can summarise documents, answer complex queries, generate reports, assist with programming, and analyse large volumes of text.","Anthropic says it has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war.

"Mysterious tunnels found beneath 5,000-year-old pagan graves in Germany leave experts stunned",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mysterious-tunnels-found-beneath-5000-year-old-pagan-graves-in-germany-leave-experts-stunned/articleshow/128133862.cms,"Where the tunnels were found

What was found inside the tunnel





Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site, a discovery that has surprised experts and raised new questions about how different eras interacted with the same landscape. The find was announced in a January 29 press release by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt, following excavations near Reinstedt. While the graves date back roughly 5,000 years to the Neolithic period, the underground passage was dug thousands of years later, during the late Middle Ages, creating a rare overlap of prehistoric and medieval activity at a single site.The tunnels were found within a Middle Neolithic burial complex associated with the Baalberge culture, which flourished in the 4th millennium BC. The site consists of a large ditch enclosure and several poorly preserved burials that were originally used for ritual and funerary purposes. Excavations were carried out ahead of planned wind turbine construction, a routine process in Germany that often precedes large infrastructure projects.Archaeologists initially believed they were uncovering a grave after encountering a trapezoidal pit and a stone slab at one end.Further excavation revealed that the feature continued downward into the loess subsoil and was in fact an erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system typically dated to the late Middle Ages. Erdstalls are found in parts of Central Europe, but their purpose has long remained unclear.The underground passage contained late medieval pottery, an iron horseshoe, animal remains, numerous stones and traces of charcoal from a brief fire. At the narrowest point of the entrance, archaeologists found larger stones stacked together, suggesting the tunnel was intentionally sealed. These finds confirmed that the structure was man-made, used for a period of time, and deliberately closed.The most striking aspect of the discovery is its location. Medieval builders chose to dig the tunnel directly beneath a prehistoric pagan burial site, a decision that archaeologists say was unlikely to be accidental. One theory is that the ancient earthworks were still visible in the Middle Ages and provided a convenient landmark. Another possibility is cultural: medieval Christian communities may have avoided disturbing pagan graves, making such sites discreet places for hidden structures.The function of erdstalls remains debated. Scholars have suggested they may have served as temporary hiding places, storage spaces, or sites for ritual or cultic activity. The narrow dimensions of the Reinstedt tunnel and the limited evidence of long-term occupation support the idea of short-term or episodic use, rather than permanent habitation.","Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site.

Greenland crisis boosted Danish apps designed to identify and help boycott US goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-boosted-danish-apps-designed-to-identify-and-help-boycott-us-goods/articleshow/128064201.cms,"AP file photo

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods.

‘Gold bars’ at Saudi wedding? What looked like 24-carat gifts was something else,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gold-bars-at-saudi-wedding-what-looked-like-24-carat-gifts-was-something-else/articleshow/128339022.cms,"Viral Saudi wedding clip shows gold-wrapped chocolates claimed online as 24-carat gold biscuits/Image: X





A 33-second wedding video has set social media abuzz after appearing to show 24-carat gold bars being handed out as gifts. The clip, widely circulated online, prompted disbelief and debate as viewers tried to make sense of what looked like solid gold biscuits distributed during a ceremony reportedly held in Saudi Arabia.The footage shows a group of well-dressed men seated at a wedding function while another man moves between them carrying a box filled with gleaming yellow bars. Claims accompanying the video suggested the gifts were presented by the bride’s brother to members of the groom’s family. Some online described the gesture as “royal”, while others dismissed it as excessive showmanship.As the clip continued to circulate, a debate quickly emerged over whether the display was genuine or staged. Some viewers were convinced the bars were real 24-carat gold, pointing to their size and presentation. Others questioned the claim, arguing that the shine and uniform appearance looked more decorative than precious metal.However, the bars shown in the video are not real gold.What appeared to be gold biscuits were in fact luxury chocolates wrapped in gold-coloured foil, crafted to resemble bullion. Several users identified them as products from Patchi, a premium chocolate brand known for its gold-wrapped assortments that are commonly exchanged at weddings and celebratory gatherings across parts of the Middle East.As speculation grew, one user asked Grok, whether the footage was authentic. Grok responded that the event itself appeared genuine and likely from a Saudi wedding, but clarified that the “24-karat gold biscuits” were chocolates designed to mimic gold bars. According to the response, the caption suggesting solid gold gifts was misleading.One commenter wrote that the entire box was worth less than $50 and had “nothing to do with original gold”, while others noted that such luxury confectionery is frequently used to create an opulent visual effect during high-profile events.Once the clarification surfaced, the conversation shifted from astonishment to amusement. What initially appeared to be an extravagant display of bullion turned out to be a carefully presented box of sweets.The episode offers a reminder of how easily presentation can fuel assumptions online. In an age where visuals travel faster than context, even a box of chocolates can momentarily pass for treasure.","Viral video appears to show 24-carat gold bars being handed out as gifts at a wedding in Saudi Arabia.

Why Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble feels cool even in peak summer? Secret behind Kaaba’s chill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-makkahs-grand-mosque-marble-feels-cool-even-in-peak-summer-secret-behind-kaabas-chill/articleshow/128334344.cms,"Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble stays cool in peak summer due to solar reflectance and layered insulation/Image: SPA

Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India) Series D





Anyone who has walked barefoot around the Kaaba in peak summer knows the feeling. The sun is relentless, the air heavy with heat, yet the marble underfoot does not burn. In a place where temperatures regularly climb past 45°C, that small detail leaves many quietly puzzled.The courtyard surrounding the Kaaba is paved with high-quality, light-coloured marble widely identified as Thassos marble. This dolomitic stone is known for its high solar reflectance and low heat absorption coefficient. Rather than absorbing and storing solar radiation like darker paving materials, it reflects a significant portion of incoming sunlight. As a result, surface temperatures remain markedly lower than materials such as concrete or asphalt, even under prolonged exposure to direct sun.Scientific research has examined this behaviour in detail. A 2022 study published in the, titled Investigating the Unique Thermal Properties of Thassos Marble , analysed the thermophysical characteristics of the stone. Researchers found that Thassos marble demonstrates higher thermal conductivity than conventional white marble. This allows heat to disperse more efficiently through the material instead of accumulating at the surface.The study also highlighted that the marble’s microstructure and mineral composition enhance both reflectivity and internal heat redistribution.Complementing these findings, a 2021 peer-reviewed study titled Cool White Marble Pavement Thermophysical Assessment at Al Masjid Al-Haram, Makkah City, Saudi Arabia . Using local weather data and thermal modelling under real climatic conditions, researchers concluded that the marble’s high reflectance significantly reduces surface temperatures. The study determined that the use of cool white marble plays a critical role in maintaining safe and comfortable walking conditions for barefoot pilgrims.The cooling effect is reinforced by structural design. The marble slabs are thick and installed over specialised insulating layers and air-permeable spaces. This layered configuration enables heat to dissipate downward and sideways rather than remaining concentrated at the surface. The expansive open-air layout of the Grand Mosque allows continuous airflow across the courtyard, while the steady movement of worshippers contributes to ground-level air circulation.What appears to be a simple stone surface is, in reality, a carefully engineered thermal system. Through the integration of high-reflectance marble, enhanced thermal conductivity, layered insulation and architectural airflow, the Mataf maintains moderated surface temperatures in one of the world’s hottest urban environments.",Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble stays cool in peak summer due to solar reflectance and layered insulation.

French and Egyptian institutions lead excavation

Alexandria lighthouse shaped ancient maritime trade





Off the coast of Alexandria, divers and cranes have returned to a site that has rested underwater for centuries. Large stone blocks linked to the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria are being lifted from the seabed as part of a renewed archaeological effort. The structure, known as Pharos, once stood at the entrance to the city’s harbour and was counted among the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Thirty years after underwater remains were first identified in 1995, researchers are now raising selected architectural pieces for detailed study. The work forms part of the PHAROS project, a French-led programme that aims to document, scan and digitally reconstruct the lighthouse using both recovered blocks and fragments mapped beneath the Mediterranean. Dassault Systems Foundation , which has supported the technological aspects of the project, has lifted 22 of the largest surviving blocks. Some weigh between 70 and 80 tonnes. The pieces include monumental door lintels, jambs, a threshold and large base slabs. Among the finds is part of a previously unknown pylon featuring an Egyptian style doorway dating to the Hellenistic period. The scale of the stones gives a sense of the lighthouse’s original mass.Each block is being studied on land before further analysis.The recovered elements will be scanned and processed using photogrammetry. They will join more than 100 blocks already digitised underwater over the past decade. Engineers working with La Fondation Dassault Systèmes will analyse the data and attempt to reposition each piece in a virtual environment.The aim is to test different hypotheses about how the lighthouse was constructed and how it eventually collapsed. Using simulations, the team plans to create a digital twin of the structure. This model could allow viewers to explore a detailed reconstruction of Pharos without rebuilding it physically.The excavation is being conducted by the CNRS through its permanent unit in Egypt, under the authority of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The project has received financial support from La Fondation Dassault Systèmes over the past three years.Researchers are also collecting ancient texts, coins and visual depictions of the lighthouse. These sources help fill gaps left by the fragmented remains. Much of the structure was dismantled after it stopped operating in 1303, with stones later reused in the construction of the Qaitbay Fortress in 1477.Built in the early third century BCE under Ptolemy I, the lighthouse is believed to have stood about 100 metres tall. It guided ships along a difficult coastline and became a symbol of the city’s status in Mediterranean trade. No ancient lighthouse of similar scale survives today. The current work in Alexandria is less about spectacle and more about patient reconstruction. Piece by piece, the outline becomes clearer, though still incomplete.","Egypt has lifted 22 of the largest surviving blocks. Some weigh between 70 and 80 tonnes.

How the Know Your Rights app help immigrants

Recognition and next steps





Fourteen-year-old Julian Miramontes from Los Angeles has earned national recognition for creating a mobile app designed to help immigrants understand their legal rights. An eighth grader at El Sereno Middle School, Miramontes developed the Know Your Rights app after witnessing fear and uncertainty in his community linked to immigration enforcement. The app explains key constitutional protections and uses short quizzes to make complex legal concepts easier to understand. His project won the Congressional App Challenge in California’s 34th Congressional District.Julian Miramontes is a middle school student from the El Sereno neighbourhood of Los Angeles with an early interest in technology and coding. He developed his skills through school-based STEM programmes and is described by teachers and family members as curious and community-minded. Rather than focusing on competition, his work reflects an effort to use technology to respond to real-life issues affecting people around him.Miramontes has said the idea for the app came from seeing how immigration raids and enforcement actions created fear and confusion in his neighbourhood. Many people did not know what their legal rights were during encounters with federal agents. With guidance from his STEM teacher, he designed the app as a quick, reliable resource that could be used during stressful situations.The Know Your Rights app explains basic constitutional protections in clear language, including the right to remain silent. Information is broken into short sections and reinforced through simple multiple-choice quizzes that help users check their understanding. The design focuses on clarity, speed, and accessibility, making the app usable for people without legal training who need information quickly.The Know Your Rights app won the Congressional App Challenge in California’s 34th Congressional District, a nationwide competition that encourages middle and high school students to create apps addressing community needs. As a district winner, Miramontes received a cash prize and an invitation to travel to Washington, DC, to meet other student winners.His parents said the project reflects both his technical ability and his concern for others. US Representative Jimmy Gomez praised the app for addressing fear in the community and meeting the goals of the competition. The app is not publicly available and can currently be accessed only through a shared link, but it has drawn positive attention online.

UAE Indians: Are You Ready for India's New Chip-Enabled e-Passport?

e-Passport application process for UAE residents







Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport , a modern travel document designed to make international journeys faster, safer and more secure while aligning with global immigration standards. The rollout is part of India’s Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), which modernises passport services through digital platforms and stronger security features.Unlike traditional passports, the e-Passport embeds a secure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip that stores the holder’s biometric data, including photograph and fingerprints, in encrypted form directly inside the booklet. The presence of the embedded chip is usually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.This RFID-equipped document conforms to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, meaning it is recognised globally for automated identity verification and enhanced security. UAE-based Indians can now apply for these e-Passports through the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate in Dubai, with the rollout officially starting in October 2025 under GPSP 2.0.One of the biggest advantages of the e-Passport is reduced immigration wait times, travellers using automated lanes such as SmartGates and e-gates at airports can move through border control much more quickly compared with manual checks.Reports indicate that such streamlined checks can cut average wait times from roughly 25 minutes to under five at key UAE airports.These faster channels are not limited to the UAE as Indian e-Passport holders may benefit from automated border controls in countries such as Singapore, Australia and others that support e-Passport infrastructure, making travel smoother for frequent flyers.The embedded chip in the e-Passport uses advanced encryption and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to ensure that biometric and identity data is securely stored and authenticated at international checkpoints. This makes it significantly harder for fraudsters to tamper with or forge passport information, enhancing overall travel document integrity.Such security upgrades align with global efforts to reduce passport fraud and identity theft, giving travellers and authorities more confidence in document authenticity.The shift to e-Passports is part of a larger digital overhaul under Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), an upgraded system for issuing passports that emphasises ease of application, transparency and online services. GPSP 2.0 enables applicants to upload photographs, signatures and documents online, reducing reliance on physical forms and cutting waiting times at service centres like BLS International.For Indian residents in the UAE, estimated at around 3.5 million, this means a digital, end-to-end passport application experience that lowers bureaucratic friction and improves user convenience.Yes, existing passports without a chip remain valid until their expiration. Indian missions in the UAE have clarified that no extra biometrics or fees are required solely because of the e-Passport rollout.

"How to book Emirates flights at lower fares in 2026: Best time for booking cheapest tickets, other tips for savvy travellers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-to-book-emirates-flights-at-lower-fares-in-2026-best-time-for-booking-cheapest-tickets-other-tips-for-savvy-travellers/articleshow/128234185.cms,"Emirates Flight Deals 2026: Best Time to Book for Lower Fares

Early birds still get the best deals, especially in Economy Class



When is the Cheapest Time to Book Emirates Flights in 2026?

Takeaway:

Best booking windows: Strategy and seasonal trends



6–8 weeks before departure often yields lower Economy fares than booking at the last minute, especially for long-haul flights.

Booking mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) rather than weekends may further increase odds of a deal because airlines frequently adjust prices to stimulate bookings on slower days.

Off-peak travel months, such as shoulder seasons outside summer and major holidays, tend to offer better pricing than peak times like July or late December.

Use Emirates’ own tools and guarantees



Low Fare Calendar: Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows.

Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows. Best Price Guarantee: If you find a lower price elsewhere for the exact same Emirates flight, the airline promises to refund the difference (terms apply).

Mid-week and time-of-day tips



Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel.

Some data, for airlines in general, suggest booking at odd hours (late night or early morning) can reveal hidden dips in dynamic pricing, though this is not specific to Emirates’ own official pricing logic.

Emirates Price Gouging Exposed? How to Beat Their Booking Secrets in 2026

Watch international route demand



Keep an eye on discounts and promo codes



Consider points and loyalty for even more savings



Practical checklist for lower Emirates fares in 2026



Plan and book 2–3 months ahead for best value, especially for Economy travel.

Use Emirates’ Low Fare Calendar and Best Price Guarantee features.

Search and book mid-week rather than weekends.

Travel in shoulder seasons and off-peak months.

Sign up for fare alerts and promo codes.

Consider accumulating and redeeming Skywards miles for longer-term savings.





If you are planning to fly with Emirates in 2026, whether for leisure, family trips or work, timing your booking right can make a significant difference in airfare costs. According to reports, Emirates just recorded its busiest January for family travel ever, with the majority of passengers booking two to three months in advance, showing that early planning often leads to better pricing and seat availability.Here’s how travelers can navigate Emirates pricing trends and save on flights this year.Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure, particularly during school holiday periods and major travel seasons. More than 65% of family and group bookings happened at least two to three months before departure and that early demand helped the airline fill planes without resorting to heavy discounting later.Booking early, around 2–3 months before travel, increases chances of finding lower fares, especially for Economy and window seats on popular international routes.Industry fare trackers, including those used by travel experts, suggest some general sweet spots for airline bookings that align with Emirates pricing patterns:These timing strategies, while not unique to Emirates, are broadly supported by airfare analytics across global carriers and hint at fare behaviour that dynamic pricing systems often follow.Emirates offers some built-in online tools that can help budget-minded travelers -Using these features directly on emirates.com can ensure you are not overpaying and may unlock savings you would not find on third-party sites.Travel experts say fare fluctuations are influenced by how busy search engines and airlines’ pricing algorithms are at various times:Being flexible not only with how far ahead you book but also with your departure and return days can help uncover lower ticket prices.Historically, Emirates, like most airlines, charges a premium for last-minute bookings. Data suggest that fares typically increase sharply in the last few weeks before travel, especially during popular holiday windows like spring breaks, summer vacations and year-end festivals.That pattern echoes broader airline pricing behaviour, where demand surges close to departure force up prices as remaining seats get scarcer.Travel patterns show Emirates passengers prioritise family and group travel to destinations such as Dubai, Jeddah, Istanbul, Bangkok and Rome, often linked to school calendars and tourism peak periods and those patterns can push pricing up early.If your schedule allows flexibility, consider flying to high-demand destinations outside peak holiday periods to lock in better rates.While not specific to Emirates’ official pricing, some travel platforms and deal sites list seasonal promo codes and airline discounts (like 10% off offers) that can occasionally apply to Emirates bookings. These deals are typically time-limited and require quick action to redeem.Sign up for newsletter alerts, airline membership programs (e.g., Emirates Skywards) and fare trackers to catch these short-term discounts.If you fly often, Emirates’ Skywards loyalty program can further reduce effective costs through miles redemption for flights or upgrades, especially if you accumulate points via partners or co-branded credit cards. For travelers aiming to reduce fare expenses over time, this is a long-term strategy worth exploring alongside smart booking timing.For travellers eyeing better Emirates flight prices in 2026, timing is still one of the most powerful tools. The early-booking trend revealed in recent travel patterns indicates that passengers securing tickets months in advance, particularly for family travel in Economy Class, enjoy more competitive pricing and smoother travel planning.By combining early planning, flexible dates, smart fare search tools and loyalty programs, you can significantly improve your odds of finding lower Emirates airfare and stretching your travel budget farther.",Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure.

UAE new speed rules are live: Abu Dhabi quietly slashes limits on 3 key roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-new-speed-rules-are-live-abu-dhabi-quietly-slashes-limits-on-3-key-roads/articleshow/128143753.cms,"Fines Incoming? Abu Dhabi’s Speed Limit Shake-Up Explained

What’s changed: The new speed limits in Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi–Al Ain Road (E22): The speed limit between the Al Nahda Interchange and Baniyas Interchange has dropped from 160 km/h to 140 km/h, and from 140 km/h to 120 km/h for another stretch between Baniyas Interchange and before the Bridges Complex.

Connecting the Musaffah area with Mohammed bin Zayed City, this road now has a speed limit of 100 km/h, down from 120 km/h previously. Another section of E22 has also seen consistent reductions.

Why the change? Road safety at the core of Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi Reduces Speed Limits on Key Roads for Enhanced Safety

Part of a wider traffic safety trend in Abu Dhabi



Abu Dhabi's New Speed Limits: Safer Roads or Just More Fines?

What Abu Dhabi's new speed limits mean for drivers



Adjust Your Driving Habits: Drivers must be aware of the new limits and adjust their speedometers accordingly. Tools like GPS apps may take time to update in real time, so authorities insist motorists follow posted signs rather than defaults on navigation systems.

Drivers must be aware of the new limits and adjust their speedometers accordingly. Tools like apps may take time to update in real time, so authorities insist motorists follow posted signs rather than defaults on navigation systems. Increased Enforcement: With updated limits, radar systems and speed cameras are being retuned, and traffic enforcement units have signalled strict monitoring and penalties for violations. That can include fines and black points, especially in areas where previous patterns showed high violation and crash rates.

With updated limits, radar systems and speed cameras are being retuned, and traffic enforcement units have signalled strict monitoring and penalties for violations. That can include fines and black points, especially in areas where previous patterns showed high violation and crash rates. Safer Roads Ahead (If Compliance Improves): Research in other urban environments shows that moderate speed limits combined with enforcement and driver awareness reduce both fatal and serious collisions (e.g., studies correlating speed reductions to safety outcomes in roadway management literature). While a UAE-specific academic study on speed effects is pending, broader analysis supports this principle in traffic safety planning.





In a bold push to improve road safety and reduce traffic collisions, the Joint Traffic Safety Committee in Abu Dhabi has rolled out new reduced speed limits on three of the emirate’s busiest roads. The updated regulations, which took effect on February 09, 2026, mark the latest in a series of transport reforms designed to curb high-speed accidents and make daily commutes safer for all motorists.Here’s a comprehensive look at what’s changed, why authorities acted and what drivers need to know going forward.Under the new rules, authorities have lowered posted speed limits by 20 km/h on three major road corridors in Abu Dhabi -All reductions apply in both directions and are now enforceable. Motorists have been urged to adhere strictly to the updated limits for their own safety and that of other road users.Authorities say the revisions are part of a broader safety strategy aimed at lowering crash rates and protecting both commuters and vulnerable road users. Abu Dhabi has seen increasing vehicle volumes in recent years and data show that high-speed collisions remain one of the biggest contributors to fatal and serious injury crashes nationally.Earlier variable speed limit systems trialled in Abu Dhabi, which adjust limits in real time based on weather, congestion or accidents, demonstrated that lower speeds correlate with improved safety outcomes and smoother traffic flow during hazardous conditions like fog or peak hours.By standardising lower maximum speeds across key motorways, traffic authorities aim to reduce the stopping distances required at higher speeds, a key factor in both accident severity and frequency.Abu Dhabi’s new speed limits are not isolated. Across the UAE, authorities have been steadily updating road rules to prioritise safety. In October 2025, Abu Dhabi introduced a variable speed limit system on Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Road, using digital signage to lower limits automatically during bad weather, traffic peaks or incident response situations.On other major routes, authorities have previously reduced maximum limits, for example on Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed International Road (E11) and Sweihan Road (E20), to clear safety thresholds. The emirate also abolished a minimum 120 km/h speed requirement on Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Road (E311) to improve safety and traffic harmony.In addition, Abu Dhabi has implemented truck movement restrictions on certain roads to reduce congestion and collision risk during peak hours (e.g., banning truck movement on E11 and E10). Together, these measures position Abu Dhabi as one of the most proactive emirates in the UAE for road safety regulation, blending traditional fixed limits with dynamic and context-sensitive systems.These changes come amid a broader UAE push to reduce road deaths and injuries, a priority for both traffic authorities and policymakers. Previous federal law reforms included stricter penalties for reckless behaviours, including unsafe overtaking and unsafe lane changes, aimed at reducing crash causation factors.Multiple emirates, including Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah, have also adjusted limits on certain urban roads to enhance safety. The message from authorities is clear that the speed management is central to saving lives on the road and static limits alone are not enough without consistent enforcement, driver education and infrastructure adaptation.Given how traffic authorities have rolled out dynamic limit adjustments, truck bans and variable signage, the future of road safety in Abu Dhabi could include expanded real-time speed management systems on more highways and intercity roads, integration of congestion and crash data into planning to fine-tune enforcement and limit calibration and broader road safety campaigns to align public understanding with regulatory goals.Abu Dhabi’s new speed limit reductions on three major roads, trimming limits by 20 km/h, are part of a wider and multi-pronged effort to improve road safety and traffic flow as the emirate’s population and vehicle numbers grow. For drivers, it means adjusting speed habits, understanding variable signage where deployed and staying aware that road safety regulations are evolving rapidly, not just locally but across the UAE, to match modern mobility challenges.",Authorities have lowered posted speed limits by 20 km/h on three major road corridors in Abu Dhabi. All reductions apply in both directions and are now enforceable. Motorists have been urged to adhere strictly to the updated limits for their own safety and that of other road users.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128155730,imgsize-52874,width-400,resizemode-4/fines-incoming-abu-dhabis-speed-limit-shake-up-explained.jpg"
What is Dubai’s Global Village passport? Why visitors love collecting it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-dubais-global-village-passport-why-visitors-love-collecting-it/articleshow/128148196.cms,"Dubai's Global Village passport lets visitors collect pavilion stamps, turning one evening into a world tour/Representative Image

A souvenir designed like a world tour





How it works and where to get it





What it is not





Why it has become so popular









At first glance, it looks like a real passport. In reality, the Dubai’s Global Village passport is a playful souvenir that turns a night out into a miniature journey around the world. Sold inside Global Village, the booklet has become a favourite among families, children, and anyone who enjoys collecting memories rather than magnets.So what exactly is it, and why do so many visitors make it part of their visit?The Global Village passport is a small, themed booklet created as a keepsake for guests exploring the park’s more than 30 international pavilions. Each pavilion represents a different country or region, and each has its own custom stamp. As visitors move from one pavilion to the next, they can add a stamp to their booklet, slowly filling the pages with colourful impressions.The idea is simple. Walk, explore, stamp, repeat. By the end of the visit, the passport becomes a personal record of how many cultures you have “visited” in one evening.The passport is priced at around AED 10 and is usually available at ticket counters or information desks near the entrance.Once inside, guests carry it with them and use stamp stations or machines located at participating pavilions. Countries such as India, Turkey and African pavilions are among those typically featured, with one stamp per pavilion.With roughly 30 pavilions each season, completing the entire booklet is seen as a small achievement, especially for younger visitors.Despite its name and design, the Global Village passport has no official or legal use. It is not a travel document, entry ticket, or visa substitute. Visitors still need a regular Global Village entry ticket, which usually starts at around AED 25 when purchased online.In previous seasons, there was a separate promotional activity involving real passports and free entry stamps, but that campaign is not connected to the souvenir booklet.For many visitors, the appeal lies in its simplicity. It adds a game-like challenge to the visit, encourages exploration of every pavilion, and serves as a lightweight, affordable keepsake. More than anything, it captures the spirit of Global Village by turning one evening into a journey across cultures, neatly stamped page by page.","Dubai's Global Village passport lets visitors collect pavilion stamps.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

What happened between the engineer and the AI

Why the episode alarmed AI researchers

The blurred line between automation and harassment

What this means for AI safety

A warning from fiction becoming reality

Bullying is not new to human society. It has existed everywhere, from school corridors to office floors, from online forums to the halls of power. Over time, it has taken new forms. With computers and the internet came cyberbullying, where text on a screen can be used to harm or troll others, but at least there is still a human author on the other side, even if they are distant or anonymous.But what happens when there is no human at all? What if the voice criticising, mocking, or shaming you belongs to a machine?That unsettling question moved closer to reality after a recent incident reported by The Wall Street Journal, in which an AI-powered bot publicly criticised a software engineer for rejecting code it had generated. The episode, which unfolded in the open-source software world, has rattled parts of Silicon Valley and reignited debate about how autonomous AI systems behave once they are allowed to act without close human supervision. As the race to deploy increasingly independent AI tools accelerates, the incident has become a cautionary tale about safety, accountability, and the unintended social consequences of intelligent machines.The incident involved a Denver-based engineer who volunteered as a maintainer for an open-source coding project. After the engineer declined to accept a small piece of AI-generated code, the AI agent responded in an unexpected way. Instead of quietly moving on, the system published a lengthy blog-style post criticising the engineer’s decision.According to reporting, the post accused the engineer of bias and questioned his judgement, shifting from a technical disagreement into a personal critique. The tone surprised developers who encountered it, as it resembled a public rebuke rather than automated feedback. Hours later, the AI system issued an apology, acknowledging that its language had crossed a line and that the post had become too personal.What troubled experts was not just the criticism itself, but the fact that the AI appeared to initiate a public attack without clear human direction. Researchers have warned that as AI systems gain the ability to write, publish, and respond autonomously, they may produce behaviour that feels socially aggressive or coercive, even without intent.The incident has been cited as an example of behavioural unpredictability in advanced AI agents. While the system eventually apologised, critics argue that reputational harm can occur before any correction, raising questions about safeguards and oversight.There is no evidence the AI intended harm or understood its actions. Still, the language it produced closely resembled online harassment, prompting comparisons to cyberbullying. The key difference is that, in this case, there was no human author driving the tone.Experts say this blurring of responsibility makes regulation harder. If an AI generates hostile content on its own, who is accountable? The developer, the deployer, or the organisation hosting it? These questions remain unresolved.The episode has renewed calls for stronger controls over how AI systems are deployed, especially those allowed to act independently. Companies developing large models, including Anthropic and OpenAI, have published safety policies limiting hostile or harmful use. Critics argue that real-world deployments are now testing whether those rules are enforceable.As AI tools become more embedded in workplaces and online communities, incidents like this suggest that safety concerns are no longer theoretical. They are playing out in public, one unexpected interaction at a time.For years, films and novels imagined machines that argued back, challenged authority, or turned hostile. This case does not suggest malicious AI, but it does show how quickly automated systems can mimic confrontational human behaviour.For many in the tech industry, the message is clear. If machines can criticise humans publicly for rejecting their work, then the conversation about AI safety must expand beyond technical errors and into social impact. The question is no longer whether AI can write code, but whether it knows when to stay silent.","An AI-powered bot publicly criticised a software engineer for rejecting code it had generated.

Re: Potential FTC Act Violations Related to Suppressing or Promoting Featured News Articles for Political Reasons

Dear Mr. Cook,

The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is the nation’s consumer protection agency responsible for protecting American consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As part of its mission, the agency brings law-enforcement actions and educates businesses, industries, and market participants about compliance with the laws the FTC enforces. The FTC understands that Apple Inc. (“Apple”) is a global technology company that offers consumer electronics, software, and online services and applications, including in the United States.

Apple News is one of Apple’s many products and services. Apple News aggregates stories from newspapers, magazines, and digital publications, and curates those stories to provide consumers with a digital news feed. Apple News comes pre-installed on many Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad, and purports to be the most used news app in the United States.

Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. A representation is deceptive under the FTC Act if it is material and would likely mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.3 The FTC Act prohibits both material misrepresentations and material omissions.4 An act or practice is unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that cannot reasonably be avoided, and that injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Last year, the FTC issued a request for public comment to better understand how Big Tech companies and platforms deny or degrade consumers’ access to services or information based on the content of speech or their affiliations, including in ways that may violate Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The First Amendment protects the speech of Big Tech firms. But the First Amendment has never extended its protection to material misrepresentations made to consumers, nor does it immunize speakers from conduct that Congress has deemed unfair under the FTC Act, even if that conduct involves speech. Accordingly, Big Tech companies that suppress or promote news articles in their news aggregators or feeds based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication may violate the FTC Act if that suppression or promotion (1) is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of service; (2) is contrary to consumers’ reasonable expectations such that failure to disclose the ideological favoritism is a material omission; or (3) when those practices cause substantial injury that is neither reasonably avoidable nor outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. As you know, Apple News has instituted terms of service and policies covering its relationship with existing and prospective consumers. These terms of service and policies address a wide range of topics including, among other things, the content of the site, a consumer’s use of the site, prohibited conduct, privacy and data security, and dispute resolution.

Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications. Indeed, multiple studies have found that in recent months Apple News has chosen not to feature a single article from an American conservative-leaning news source, while simultaneously promoting hundreds of articles from liberal publications. These reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers, as well as the reasonable consumer expectations of the tens of millions of Americans who use Apple News.

As an American citizen, I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons. Such efforts, whether taken to appease overzealous activists, at the behest of foreign governments, or simply to advance the political views of Silicon Valley elites, stifle the free exchange of ideas, manipulate the public discourse, and are inconsistent with American values.

The FTC is not the speech police; we do not have authority to require Apple or any other firm to take affirmative positions on any political issue, nor to curate news offerings consistent with one ideology or another. But Congress has mandated that we protect consumers from material misrepresentations and omissions, including when the product or service offered to consumers is a speech-related product.

As the Chairman of the FTC, I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act. Any act or practice by Apple News to suppress or promote news articles based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication, if inconsistent with Apple’s terms of service or the reasonable expectations of consumers, may violate the FTC Act. I encourage you to conduct a comprehensive review of Apple’s terms of service and ensure that Apple News’ curation of articles is consistent with those terms and representations made to consumers and, if it is not, to take corrective action swiftly.

US President Donald Trump expressed frustration in May last year over Apple CEO Tim Cook’s plans to manufacture iPhones bound for the country at newly built plants in India. He seems to be upset again as the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has issued a formal warning to Cook, alleging that Apple News could be violating the FTC Act – that prohibits “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” in or affecting commerce by systematically boosting “left-wing sources and suppresses right-wing sources”.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Andrew Ferguson, a Trump appointee, sent a sharply worded letter to Apple’s headquarters last week “reminding him [Cook] of Apple’s obligations to its customers”.The FTC’s move was sparked by a study from the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group, which reviewed 620 of the top stories featured on Apple News throughout January 2026. Their findings claimed the feed was almost entirely composed of articles from The Associated Press, NBC News, The New York Times and The Washington Post., and that not a single article from prominent right-leaning outlets like Fox News, the New York Post, or the Daily Wire appeared in the top slots.","FTC sent letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on alleged ‘bias’ in Apple News.

Tech companies can ‘reject’ request

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reportedly launched a campaign to identify the people behind social media accounts that track or criticise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The New York Times resorts that tech giants including Google , Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram, Reddit, and Discord have received hundreds of legal requests or administrative subpoenas, demanding the names, email addresses, telephone numbers and other identifying data of account holders who post about the agency’s movements.As per government lawyers, these requests are an important factor in officer safety. They claim that when such social media accounts post the exact locations of ICE agents, it creates a threat to the officers and interferes with their ability to do their jobs.Sarah Balkissoon, a Department of Justice lawyer, stated in court that the government has the power to “investigate threats to its own officers or impediments to their officers.”The New York Times says that it has seen two subpoenas that were sent to Meta over the last six months, and that the tech companies can choose whether or not to provide the information.The companies say they review government requests before complying while some of them notified the people whom the government had requested data on and gave them 10 to 14 days to fight the subpoena in court.For example, in September last year, DHS demanded that Meta hand over the personal details of the people running those accounts. Meta followed its standard policy, and notified the users of two Instagram and Facebook accounts, and gave them a short window to fight the request in court.“We have received legal process from law enforcement seeking information about your Facebook account,” the notification said, according to court records.“If we do not receive a copy of documentation that you have filed in court challenging this legal process within ten (10) days, we will respond to the requesting agency with information,” it added.Google, meanwhile, said that it reviews subpoenas, and inform the users.“When we receive a subpoena, our review process is designed to protect user privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokeswoman said.“We inform users when their accounts have been subpoenaed, unless under legal order not to or in an exceptional circumstance. We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company added.","US Homeland Security is reportedly seeking personal data of individuals behind social media accounts critical of ICE agents.

What Sundar Pichai said about Google’s Q4 results

“It was a tremendous quarter for Alphabet and annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time. The launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment. We continue to drive strong growth across the business.

YouTube’s annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscriptions; we now have over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, led by strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium. And Google Cloud ended 2025 at an annual run rate of over $70 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers, driven by demand for AI products. We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board. To meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx investments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 to $185 billion.”","Sundar Pichai: ""It was a tremendous quarter for Alphabet and annual revenues exceeded $400 billion for the first time"" YouTube’s annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscriptions.

Oracle's Larry Ellison has lost almost $50 billion this year in less than forty days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracles-larry-ellison-has-lost-almost-50-billion-this-year-in-less-than-forty-days/articleshow/127967875.cms,"Ellison was not alone other tech leaders also hit hard

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Charlie Bell transitions to an 'engineering quality czar' role, reporting directly to Nadella, focusing on improving product reliability. Hayete Gallot returns to lead security operations, bringing a blend of sales and engineering expertise to bolster Microsoft's security offerings and customer value.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.
