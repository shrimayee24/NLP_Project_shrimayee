Open the game and tap the handbag icon on the left side of your screen.

Type in the promo code to the text box that opens.

Press Enter to redeem your item immediately.

Tip:

If a code fails, check for typos twice—many codes require capital letters and substitutions between characters (such as the number '0' for the letter 'O'). If all appears well and the code

Sam Altman just dropped a big AI prediction for 2026; experts are skeptical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-just-dropped-a-big-ai-prediction-for-2026-experts-are-skeptical/articleshow/121811592.cms,"Sam Altman AI prediction for 2026

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful.""Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that by 2026, AI systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" ""Novel insight"" is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses.

Travis Hunter made an investment worth over $3 million with Leanna Lenee







Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, are busy enjoying their newly married days and are keeping themselves far away from all the controversies around their wedding. The recent Heisman Trophy winner and the NFL rookie, Travis Hunter, has been constantly trolled for not signing a prenup agreement with Leanna Lenee before tying the knot, but he has remained silent. Now, after months of staying away from social media, Travis Hunter’s wife, Leanna Lenee, has given an update about her life.Recently, Travis Hunter’s wife, Leanna Lenee, posted a video on TikTok about her experience at an event for NFL WAGs and how everyone treated her.Leanna Lenee said, “A couple wives and girlfriends and fiancées — and retired wives were there so I got to meet a lot of them…I get nervous around people and I always feel like I come off as standoffish or mean”.Leanna Lenee added, ” All the ladies here are very welcoming and were understanding of that. I think there was a lot of girls like me where we were kind of like nervous, but there were a lot of returning wives and, of course, they’re comfortable with each other…”The NFL WAGs event was organised by Women of the NFL and hosted by Jacksonville Jaguars’ Trevor Lawrence’s wife, Marrisa Lawrence, along with Tiffany Upshaw and Shelley Causey McCray.While it seems like Travis Hunter’s wife, Leanna Lenee, had a lot of fun at the event, the video raised many eyebrows.Recently, as per reports, Travis Hunter bought a luxurious apartment in Jacksonville Jaguars along with his wife, Leanna Lenee. The 13 bedroom house is worth over $3 million and comes with a luxurious pool and a huge tennis court.While the couple are busy making smart investments for their future, it did not take long for fans to start trolling the couple.A fan took to X and wrote, “He gone get her pregnant and that’s when she gone start acting funny”, while another fan wrote, “Mf got 13 rooms but couldn’t think of 13 reasons why not to marry that h*e”.A third fan posted, “Travis really went all in marriage, no prenup, $3.2M mansion… in the same breath.

Android 16 IS HERE! Live Notifications, Tablet Desktop Mode & MORE!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines. In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Thursday at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, Huang said “This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.”Nvidia is playing an important role in the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), supplying both hardware and software to support their development. The US chip giant is a key enabler behind the growing fleet of self-driving cars , especially in the U.S., where Waymo — owned by Google — operates robotaxi services in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.China has also seen growing adoption, with companies like Baidu and Pony.ai running their own robotaxi networks.Recently, Huang attended the London Tech Week where he said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. Admitting that computing was hard historically, he said “We had to learn programming languages. We had to architect it. We had to design these computers that are very complicated”. “Now, all of a sudden ... there’s a new programming language. This new programming language is called ‘human,’” he added. ""Most people don't know C++, very few people know Python, and everybody, as you know, knows human.”He continued: “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely.”“And the thing that’s really, really quite amazing is the way you program an AI is like the way you program a person.”Explaining further, Huang gave an example saying, “You say, 'You are an incredible poet.

HOME: Where I can look ugly and enjoy it.

Today morning when I was driving my Ferrari, the alarm woke me up.

Dear Math, please grow up and solve your problems. I'm tired of answering them for you.

Normal is boring.

I need Google in my brain.

I like to hang out with people that make me forget to look at my phone.

I've found the recipe for happiness. Can someone just send me some money so that I can buy the ingredients?

I love food and sleep. If I give you a bit of food or text you all night, that means something.

Be your own kind of beautiful

Unlike protons I don’t deal with negativity

ME my room music internet connection no study a perfect day

If u can’t do great things then do small and simple things in a great way

Real beauty is to be true to oneself that’s what makes me feel good

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don’t have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Keep calm and let karma finish it

I’m not a player I’m the game

Don’t tell people your dreams show them

Success is the best revenge for anything

I’m not special I’m just a limited edition

Be so good they can’t ignore you

I may be wrong but I doubt it

Turn your wounds into wisdom

Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive

Be a voice not an echo

Keep your heels head and standards high

My life my rules my attitude

Make today so awesome that yesterday gets jealous

Life is short make every hair flip fabulous

Be your own kind of beautiful

The best things in life are free The second best are very expensive

Confidence is not they will like me Confidence is I’ll be fine if they don’t

Collect moments not things

You are enough just as you are

Find yourself and be that

Don’t be a prisoner of your past Become the architect of your future

Choose people who choose you

Be fearless in pursuing what sets your soul on fire

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside

Don’t stop until you’re proud

I am not a product of my circumstances I am a product of my decisions

Stay real stay loyal or stay away from me

Life is too short to be serious all the time So if you cant laugh at yourself call me Ill laugh at you

Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don't have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Motivational WhatsApp captions



What you lack in talent can be made up with desire, hustle, and giving 110% all the time.

Do what you can with all you have, wherever you are.

Develop an attitude of gratitude. Say thank you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you.

You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new one.

To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage.

Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.

Fake it until you make it. Act as if you had all the required confidence until it becomes your reality.

The future belongs to the competent. Get good, get better, be the best.

For every reason it’s not possible, there are hundreds of people who have faced the same circumstances and succeeded.

Be a fountain, not a drain.

Great things never come from comfort zones.

Life is a journey, not a destination.

Life always offers you a second chance. It’s called tomorrow.

Every new day is another chance to change your life.

Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.

Prove yourself to yourself, not to others.

Work for a cause, not applause. Live life to express, not to impress.

When you can’t change the direction of the wind, adjust your sails.

Why fit in if you’re born to stand out?

Don’t take kindness as a sign of weakness.

Minds are like parachutes — they only function when open.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.

Hustle in silence, let your results make the noise.

Every day is a fresh start – make it count.

Dream big. Work hard. Stay focused.

Rise above the storm and you’ll find the sunshine.

The grind never lies.

Your only limit is your mindset.

Make it happen. Shock everyone.

Progress over perfection, always.

Don’t wait for an opportunity. Create it.

Fuel your hustle with passion.

You weren’t born to be average.

Prove them wrong – every single day.

Stay hungry, stay humble.

Keep going – your future self will thank you.

Build a life you don’t need a vacation from.

The best views come after the hardest climbs.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

This year is yours – take the shot.

If there was an award for laziness I'd probably send someone to pick it up for me

I don't sweat I sparkle

Id agree with you but wed both be wrong

My hobbies include eating and complaining that I’m getting fat

I’m not short I’m concentrated awesome

Who needs GPS when you have zero direction in life

I’m silently correcting your grammar

WiFi food my bed Perfection

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I’m drowning in memories and there’s no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It’s hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren’t as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it’s not

I’m not okay but I’ll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It’s hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I’m left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I’m tired of fighting for a love that’s already gone

The scars you can’t see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine

Lost in a world that doesn’t see me

It hurts, but I’ll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect… until we weren’t

Crying isn’t a weakness, it’s a release

The hardest part is acting like it’s okay

Some scars never show, but they’re the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn’t say goodbye

I’m okay… just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Life WhatsApp captions



Life isn’t perfect but it has perfect moments

Just because you’re breathing doesn’t mean you’re living

Life goes on with or without you

Collect moments not things

Life is a one time offer use it well

Don’t count the days make the days count

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine

In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take

Be yourself life’s too short to be anyone else

Life’s beauty lies in small moments

Life is tough but so are you

Fall in love with taking care of yourself

Live the story you want to tell

Don’t survive thrive

Life doesn’t have to be perfect to be beautiful

Let your life be your message

Live less out of habit more out of intent

You only live once but if you do it right once is enough

Life is a journey enjoy the ride

Don’t just exist live

Life is made of moments not milestones

Be the energy you want to attract

Make peace with your past so it doesn’t spoil your present

The best view comes after the hardest climb

Life rewards the brave

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Live life to the fullest

To live is the rarest thing in the world Most people exist that is all

Life is short and its up to you to make it sweet

In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself

Life is too important to be taken seriously

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Life is a onetime offer use it well

Life is a beautiful struggle

Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet

Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all

Life is made of ever so many partings welded together

Life is trying things to see if they work

Most remembered line from Steve Jobs’s Stanford speech

“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life”

“Stay hungry, stay foolish.”

A speech about more than tech

Apple's HUGE iPhone makeover: iOS 26 & Liquid Glass Explained!

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently marked the 20th anniversary of Steve Jobs’ iconic 2005 Stanford commencement address by sharing a tribute to the late Apple co-founder on social media. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Cook wrote “It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years since Steve told Stanford graduates to stay hungry and stay foolish.” He continued, “His powerful advice still rings true, and I hope it helps guide this year’s new grads as they begin their journey to become tomorrow’s leaders.”In the post, Cook also shared a link to a newly updated version of Jobs’ famous speech, hosted on the Steve Jobs Archive website. The video has been enhanced from standard to high definition. The 2005 video, has been watched over 120 million times, and is one of the most influential commencement addresses in history. It has also been reproduced in media and school curricula around the world. ( You can watch it here As mentioned on the website, Job’s speech even helped inspire the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2016 NBA comeback, when LeBron James played a clip of it before Game 3 of the Finals. While the webpage includes rare photos, early drafts, and behind-the-scenes details about how the speech came together.The speech delivered by Jobs – a college dropout to one of the world’s top universities, has resonated deeply with audiences over the years. It included three personal stories from Jobs’ life, and its most remembered lines were deeply reflective:andAccording to the Steve Jobs Archive , Jobs spent months preparing for the speech. He worked on drafts, asked friends for advice, and collaborated closely with his wife, Laurene.On stage, Jobs wore jeans, a black shirt, and Birkenstocks under his graduation robe. Despite the heat and distractions in the stadium, he delivered his speech word-for-word. “This is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation,” he joked as he began.After the event, the class co-presidents sent him a thank-you note. Jobs replied: “Thank you all very much. It was really hard for me to prepare for this, but I loved it (especially when it was over…).”Though Jobs was known as a visionary in technology, his Stanford address focused on universal human experiences—love, loss, mortality, and staying true to oneself. He once said, “People sometimes forget that they are very unique… The whole computer industry wants to forget about the humanist side.” The speech was a reminder that he hadn’t.The Steve Jobs Archive now preserves that legacy with rare artifacts, including Jobs’ handwritten speech drafts, his Reed College acceptance letter, and even the Whole Earth Catalog that inspired his famous closing line.","Apple CEO Tim Cook marked the 20th anniversary of Steve Jobs’ iconic 2005 Stanford commencement address by sharing a tribute to the late Apple co-founder on social media.

BENGALURU: Vrooming in a supercar in Bengaluru could turn into an unpleasant experience within seconds.“Potholes, oversized speedbreakers, and poorly designed dividers lacking reflectors present significant challenges. These become particularly problematic for supercars which typically have low ground clearance,” says Rajath KK, 23, who owns a BMW M6.Many Bengalureans today can afford high-performance supercars and have the passion to drive them, but the limitations are many. Night drives are safer, says Rajath, who lives in Abbigere in Jalahalli and runs an interior design company.“Navigating the city requires careful planning. I drive during early morning hours or late at night for several reasons – heavy traffic congestion in the city, local residents’ reactions, and unpredictable lane changes by other motorists,” he says. Waterlogging is another big concern, especially during the monsoon season. “We invest considerable resources in purchasing and modifying these vehicles, and any damage would result in substantial repair costs,” Rajath says.Zubair Ali Jung, who drives around Bengaluru in his Audi 8, notes that supercar owners pay premium road taxes, but have to settle for potholes and uneven surfaces that severely impact the driving experience.Rajath pleads that supercar and bike owners are a misunder stood lot. “High-performance exhausts in our vehicles are not merely aesthetic additions but crucial components that enhance vehicle performance and functionality,” he says.For all their complaints, supercar owners also have their many moments of joy. “The roar of my supercar’s V-10 engine gives me a high, with the intake and exhaust notes turning me on,” says A R Shabbir, businessman and racer who owns a Lamborghini.Rajath looks forward to car enthusiast gatherings, which are gaining popularity. Team Clutches, a group founded by him, hosts meetups and car shows. He is a regular at events organized by 6th Gear and Htrz Modz too. The events, he says, foster a sense of community amongst fellow enthusiasts.Zubair also loves meeting new people. The 36-year-old, nicknamed Spiderman by his friends, says owning a supercar can broaden one’s social connections.“It feels great to be part of a community of enthusiasts. When we glide into these beauties and cruise together, it creates wonderful moments of happiness and camaraderie,” smiles Jung, who is part of groups like Team1 Racing and Team Clutches.At these gatherings, participants share knowledge and collaborate on shared objectives. The supercar market in India is unorganised. Interactions with other car enthusiasts helps one gain valuable insights on what needs to be sold or bought.Aditya Arora, founder of Boit Club and who has been a supercar owner for the last 14 years, says they regularly coordinate social gatherings and facilitate new vehicle unveiling ceremonies. A specialised 3D animation facility that he offers helps create detailed visualisations of supercar modifications prior to actual implementation.""The Porsche 911 Turbo S can blast from 0-100 km/h in 2.6 seconds. It was the last production car of its kind in India. Future cars will be hybrid and they will never be the same,"" says, Praveen (Big Daddy), Supercar Collector.""Driving or owning a Ferrari is a matchless experience, combining raw power with sophisticated handling and comfort. What makes it even more unique is that it is modified with the world’s best exhaust system – Novitec. The engine sound is intense, and the car’s agility and responsiveness are impressive, especially considering its size. It seamlessly merges performance with luxury,"" Aamir AW, Entrepreneur, Industrialist and Supercar Collector","Many Bengalureans today can afford high-performance supercars.

Bach's St. John Passion in queer and Arabian versions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/bachs-st-john-passion-in-queer-and-arabian-versions/articleshow/121825311.cms,"Representative AI image

Experience Bach in Arabic

Transforming the St. John Passion

Adding a Middle Eastern touch to Bach

Playing for the emir of Abu Dhabi





Violence against LGBTQ+ people and well as war and displacement in Gaza inspire two adaptations of one of Johann Sebastian Bach's works on the story of Christ. Queer Passion,"" by author, director and dramaturge Thomas Höft, opens with a reference to the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting targeting the LGBTQ+ community, in which 49 people died and 53 were injured. It is one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in US history.Played by the Art House 17 orchestra on period instruments, Höft's work uses as its musical basis Johann Sebastian Bach's famous St. John Passion, based on the Gospel story of the suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross.In his libretto, however, Höft describes the stories of queer people who are discriminated against or murdered. ""I asked myself, where do I, as a queer man, appear in classical music?"" Höft told DW. And he quickly realized that the answer was: ""Actually, not at all."" And that is precisely what he wants to change.Bach's St. John Passion also served as a model for the Bulgarian musician and musicologist Vladimir Ivanoff in his ""Arabian Passion."" The composer is concerned with the people living in the Middle East, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, whose suffering through war, displacement and oppression has a long history.The impetus for his ""Arabian Passion"" was the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, which had devastating consequences for the civilian population. ""And I feel the same way about Gaza now. I had several music students from the Middle East in my workshops, of whom I'm only sporadically informed if they're still alive,"" Ivanoff told DW.Ivanoff left the text and music by Johann Sebastian Bach in their original form, but some of the instruments come from the Arabian Mediterranean region. Lebanese singer Fadia El-Hage sings all of Bach's arias in Arabic.Both the Arabian and the queer versions of the St. John Passion are now on tour. They will be performed, among other works, as part of the Bachfest n Leipzig, held from June 12-22. The revisited versions of the work appropriately fit into this year's theme for the Bach festival, ""Transformation.""It was in Leipzig that Johann Sebastian, while serving as Cantor of St. Thomas Church, composed his famous St. John Passion in 1723.Bach often rewrote his cantatas himself, using the so-called parody technique. He also had them performed by other ensembles.For example, he later added a sacred text to secular cantatas, thus placing them in a different context. Thomas Höft and Vladimir Ivanoff build on this approach with their version of the St. John Passion.For his ""Arabian Passion,"" Vladimir Ivanoff has recombined pieces from the St. John Passion and Bach's St. Matthew Passion.Instead of sticking to the traditional combination of orchestra and choir, his ensemble Sarband also features the jazzy Modern String Quartet. The ensemble also includes instruments from the Mediterranean region, such as the long-necked lute ud, the flute ney and the Arabic violin.Sarband means ""connection."" Ivanoff sees himself as a bridge-builder and wants to connect the West and the East through music. The mere fact that Christian texts from the St. John Passion are sung in Arabic, and by a woman at that, can be seen as a provocation for conservative Muslims. This makes it all the more surprising that Vladimir Ivanoff and his Sarband ensemble have been welcome guests at various Arab music festivals.Since 2003, Sarband has been touring the Middle East with the ""Arabian Passion."" The ensemble has performed in the cathedral of Beirut and in Aleppo, Syria. ""We also performed the Passion in Damascus at the Alhambra Cinema, a very famous jazz concert hall,"" says IvanoffThey were also invited to Abu Dhabi to perform during the Sheikh Zayed Book Award ceremony. The Emir liked their music. However, shortly before the event, organizers noticed that a female singer was planned. That couldn't be allowed; the ensemble had to play an entirely instrumental version of the work.Ivanoff also travels with his ensemble to Hezbollah-held areas. Sometimes, lyrics or titles of Christian and Jewish songs are changed, he says, but he accepts that. ""That's our principle: we want to get into the structures at all costs,"" says Ivanoff. ""I see myself a bit as a musical guerrilla. What we do is effective, and this gentle seduction works incredibly well.""","Violence against LGBTQ+ people and war and displacement in Gaza inspire two adaptations of one of Johann Sebastian Bach's works on the story of Christ.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it good for the ocean’s ecosystem?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-the-uae-deliberately-sank-3-ships-is-it-good-for-the-oceans-ecosystem/articleshow/121820770.cms,"Inchcape 1, sunk off Al Aqah in 2001, has transformed into a thriving marine habitat, attracting divers with its diverse marine life/ Image: vipdivingdubai





The Concept: Artificial Reefs for Marine Life





Inchcape 1: A Diver’s Haven in Al Aqah





Inchcape 2: A Thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A Marine Wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological Balance and Marine Conservation

Khaleej Times





In a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.","The UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation.

The bill was introduced by Senators Julie Pazina, Dina Neal, Edgar Flores, Melanie Scheible, and Lisa Krasner, and Assemblymembers Erica P. Roth and Duy Nguyen.The bill permits religious displays upon dwellings that are no larger than 12” x 36”. The bill also requires maintenance workers to store religious displays in a way that preserves its sanctity.“This bill is a significant win for Nevada Hindus because it ensures residents’ right not only to observe their Hindu faith unencumbered, but also to bless their homes and everyone who enters them with the display of a toran, as their faith calls them to,"" HAF managing director Samir Kalra said.The law will come into force on October 1, 2025.The bill overrides any homeowner association (HOA) or residential restrictions that might prohibit such displays, thereby safeguarding the religious practices of Nevada residents.The Hindu toran, a traditional decorative item often hung above doorways, holds cultural and religious significance in Hindu households. It is typically adorned with intricate designs and symbols that bless the home and its inhabitants, inviting prosperity and warding off negative energies.The Jewish mezuzah, similarly, is a small case containing a piece of parchment inscribed with specific Hebrew verses from the Torah, affixed to the doorposts of Jewish homes as a sign of faith and protection.“Nevada Senate Bill 201 will protect all faith communities.

A Delta Airlines passenger in the US, Pat McAuliffe, prompted a debate online after he made public posts on social media complaining about a crying baby on the flight. McAullife posted videos of himself on his public account where he looks visibly distraught, as the plane remained grounded for over two hours.McAuliffe is a contributor to Barstool Sports, a sports and pop culture blog based in New York City.In a follow-up video, he sympathized with the parents of the baby but urged that the parents could “try something new” to distract the baby, like walking him up and down the aisle. He said that simply praying was “not acceptable”.In the third video, McAuliffe asked when the situation could be declared a “medical emergency,” as he stressed the parents were not even talking to the baby in an attempt to soothe him.McAuliffe’s video has garnered millions of views, and it has divided netizens into two categories, those who sympathized with the parents and criticized McAuliffe and those who sided with him.One user asked McAuliffe to buy “proper noise-cancelling headphones,” while another added that the parents of the baby were “stressing out” more than McAuliffe. To this, McAuliffe replied that he could be 1000 feet under water and the child's cry would still penetrate his ears.One user replied to McAuliffe’s video with “If kids bother you this much, maybe skip public transportation and book a private jet next time”.McAuliffe’s situation also drew some sympathy.A user quoted on one of McAuliffe’s videos with “I can only imagine listening to a crying baby that’s not mine for 2 hours straight with nowhere to escape”.Another comment also urged that a person should be allowed to have the space to be “compassionate but still annoyed.”","Pat McAuliffe is a contributor to Barstool Sports, a sports and pop culture blog based in New York City.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Mark Cuban faces users backlash, asked to ...

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky , the decentralized social media platform he once championed, for becoming “ruder and more hateful,” according to a report by the New York Post. Cuban, known for his tech ventures and former ownership of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, warned that the platform’s lack of diverse perspectives is driving users back to Elon Musk ’s X, formerly Twitter.Cuban, who joined Bluesky in late 2024 with an optimistic post -— “Hello Less Hateful World” -- now says the platform has devolved into a hostile echo chamber. “The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,” he wrote in a series of posts this week, as quoted by the Post. He noted that the platform’s predominantly left-leaning user base often meets dissenting or nuanced opinions with outrage, stifling meaningful discussion. “Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban added.The Post reports that Cuban, who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election but did not donate to her campaign, shared a Washington Post opinion piece by Megan McArdle, which argued that Bluesky’s left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban endorsed the piece, urging users to use the platform’s moderation tools to block rather than attack those they disagree with. “The moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don’t want to see on here, just block them. Don’t attack them,” he wrote.However, Cuban’s critiques sparked backlash from some Bluesky users , the Post noted. Responses included profane attacks, with one user writing, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t,” and another stating, “F–kin leave then, p—y.” A third user, whose post Cuban reposted, called him a “despicable bastard” and told him to “just Go Away.”The report highlighted Bluesky’s rapid growth, noting that its user base tripled from 10 million to over 30 million between November 2024 and May 2025, according to Pew Research Center. This surge followed Elon Musk’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which prompted many liberal-leaning users to leave X for Bluesky. Yet, Cuban’s recent comments suggest the platform’s ideological slant may now be pushing users back to Twitter.Cuban, whose net worth is approximately $8.35 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, lamented that even minor disagreements on Bluesky often escalate into hostility. “Even if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a grey area, they will call you a fascist etc.,” he wrote, per the Post.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky, the decentralized social media platform he once championed.

Why Amazon is increasing ad times for Prime Video users



India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

Amazon Prime Video users on the ad-supported tier may be facing an increased number of commercials. The streaming platform owned by the e-commerce giant has reportedly doubled the ads it served per hour. This rumoured change comes after Amazon introduced advertisements to its Prime Video streaming service last year, with an initial promise of a light and uniterreputing experience. According to a report by Adweek, the latest move aims to increase monetisation from its audience. The ad supported tier isn’t available in India yet, but Amazon has announced that Prime Video content in India will include ""limited advertisements"" beginning June 17.As per the report, Amazon Prime Video has doubled its ad load to “four to six minutes per hour,” up from the two to three-and-a-half minutes promised when ads launched in January 2024.An Amazon spokesperson has even confirmed the increase to AdWeek but the reported didn't specify any details. However, the report cited industry sources to claim that the company has quietly signaled the same to investors for months.This surge in ad time is part of Amazon’s broader push to monetise its streaming investment that will help the company invest billions into originals like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and The Boys, the report claims.Earlier this year, reports surfaced that Amazon would auction off ad spots and deploy more targeted, context-driven ads using its extensive consumer data. While advertisers may welcome these changes, viewers see their experience as collateral damage.To compare, Prime Video rival Netflix , has also avoided ads for years but eventually introduced an ad-supported tier to attract viewers deterred by price hikes.The report notes that streaming services often launch with generous pricing to outcompete rivals, then raise prices or increase monetisation once they dominate the market.",Amazon Prime Video users on the ad-supported tier may be facing an increased number of commercials.

Researchers find 'dangerous' AI data leak flaw in Microsoft 365 Copilot: What the company has to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/researchers-find-dangerous-ai-data-leak-flaw-in-microsoft-365-copilot-here-is-what-its-designed-to-do/articleshow/121834812.cms,"What is EchoLeak attack and how it worked

A critical artificial intelligence (AI) vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft 365 Copilot, raising new concerns about data security in AI-integrated enterprise environments. The flaw, dubbed 'EchoLeak', which enabled attackers to exfiltrate sensitive user data with zero-click interaction, has been devised by Aim Labs researchers in January 2025.According to a report by Bleeping Computer, Aim Labs promptly reported their findings to Microsoft, which rated it as critical. Microsoft swiftly addressed the issue, implementing a server-side fix in May 2025. This means that no user action is required to patch the vulnerability.Microsoft has also stated there is no evidence of any real-world exploitation, essentially confirming that no customers were impacted by this flaw.The EchoLeak attack commenced with a malicious email sent to the target. This email contained text seemingly unrelated to Copilot, designed to resemble a typical business document. It embedded a hidden prompt injection crafted to instruct Copilot's underlying LLM to extract sensitive internal data. Because this hidden prompt was phrased like a normal message, it cleverly bypassed Microsoft's existing XPIA (cross-prompt injection attack) classifier protections.Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI assistant integrated into Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams, leverages OpenAI's GPT models and Microsoft Graph to help users generate content, analyse data and answer questions based on their organisation's internal files, emails, and chats.When the user prompted Copilot with a related business question, Microsoft's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) engine retrieved the malicious email into the LLM's prompt context due to its apparent relevance and formatting. Once inside the LLM's active context, the malicious injection ""tricked"" the AI into pulling sensitive internal data and embedding it into a specially crafted link or image.This led to unintentional leaks of internal data without explicit user intent or interaction.","Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI assistant integrated into Office applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams.

What is different in AMD's newest AI chips



AMD has unveiled details about its Instinct MI400 series , the company's next generation of AI chips set to ship next year. CEO Lisa Su presented the chips at a launch event in San Jose, California, emphasising their design for ""rack-scale"" systems crucial for powering the massive AI computations of today and tomorrow. Su also claimed that AMD’s MI355X can outperform Nvidia ’s Blackwell chips.The MI400 series chips are designed to be assembled into a full server rack, dubbed Helios, which AMD described as a unified system capable of tying thousands of chips together, as per a report by CNBC.""For the first time, we architected every part of the rack as a unified system,"" Su explained, highlighting Helios as ""really a rack that functions like a single, massive compute engine.""A significant endorsement came from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who appeared on stage with Su. Altman expressed confidence in the new chips""When you first started telling me about the specs, I was like, there’s no way, that just sounds totally crazy. It’s gonna be an amazing thing,"" said Altman, whose company is a customer of Nvidia chips. OpenAI also confirmed it will be integrating the AMD chips.This ""rack-scale"" approach is vital for hyperscale AI clusters that span entire data centers, catering to the enormous power demands of cloud providers and developers of large language models, the report said. Su directly compared Helios to Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin racks, signaling AMD's intent to directly challenge its main rival.AMD's rack-scale technology aims to put its latest chips squarely in competition with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which already offer configurations integrating 72 graphics-processing units. Nvidia currently holds a near-monopoly in the market for big data center GPUs, partly due to its early lead in developing essential AI software like CUDA.OpenAI, notably a significant Nvidia customer, has been providing feedback to AMD on its MI400 roadmap. AMD is positioning the MI400 chips, along with this year’s MI355X chips, as a more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's offerings.Su also claimed that AMD’s MI355X can outperform Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, despite Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software advantage, saying that AMD's ""really strong hardware"" and the ""tremendous progress"" made by open software frameworks.","AMD unveils MI400 series of AI chips set to ship next year.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.
