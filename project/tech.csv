In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

K-dramas are more than just addictive storylines, they are visual masterpieces that shape global fashion, photography, and lifestyle trends. Male leads, whether it’s Vincenzo’s sharp-suited mafia lawyer or the gritty survivors of Squid Game, embody style, emotion, and cinematic presence. What makes them unforgettable isn’t only their outfits but also the way they own each scene, rain-drenched confrontations, snowy night walks, or quiet moments in cafés. With the right Gemini prompts, you can recreate this K-drama magic in your own photos. Below are 10 carefully designed prompts to help boys style their pictures like true K-drama heroes.“Man in a perfectly tailored Italian-style black suit, standing confidently under city skyscrapers at dusk, cinematic lighting, moody atmosphere, sharp details like polished shoes and gold watch, K-drama hero energy.”This look channels Vincenzo Cassano’s mafia lawyer vibe—sleek, confident, and intimidating. To make it work, go for a slim-fit black suit with minimal accessories. Pose with a strong stance, shoulders back, and eyes slightly narrowed to show authority. A backdrop with skyscrapers or glass buildings enhances the powerful city hero mood.“Young man in a military jacket, standing in the rain under streetlights, droplets visible on hair and jacket, determined expression, cinematic K-drama rain scene vibe.”Rain scenes in K-dramas often symbolise emotional turning points. To recreate this, use a dimly lit street or open area and let water droplets naturally fall on your hair and clothes. Keep your expression focused—half vulnerable, half determined—to reflect inner strength. Lighting should highlight the rain for extra drama.“Man wearing a green tracksuit with white stripes, standing in a gritty playground arena, serious expression, dramatic shadows, cinematic survival vibe.”This look is about raw survival and determination. The tracksuit is key—it represents struggle and resilience. Pair it with a tense body posture, like slightly hunched shoulders or clenched fists. Shooting in an empty playground, abandoned space, or gritty street corner will heighten the effect of a high-stakes moment.“Boy in casual pastel hoodie and white sneakers, sitting on university steps with books beside him, soft morning light, gentle smile, K-drama romantic lead aura.”This style captures the sweet, approachable vibe of a student lead. Use pastel-coloured hoodies, simple jeans, and sneakers. Pose casually—leaning on steps or sitting cross-legged—to appear natural and relaxed. Soft morning light adds innocence, while a gentle smile completes the warm, boy-next-door aesthetic.“Man with buzzcut hairstyle, sitting on a dimly lit rooftop overlooking neon-lit city streets, wearing casual jacket, pensive expression, deep K-drama mood.”Rooftops often symbolise solitude and resilience in K-dramas. Keep the styling simple—neutral jackets or sweaters—and use the neon cityscape in the background. Sit or lean with a thoughtful expression, as if lost in deep reflection. This creates an introspective, cinematic atmosphere.“Young man in leather jacket, leaning against a motorbike under streetlights, rebellious smirk, smoky night background, cinematic teen K-drama rebel look.”This is the ultimate bad-boy look. A leather jacket is essential, paired with dark jeans or boots. The pose should be relaxed yet confident, crossed arms or leaning casually. Add a smirk to convey playful rebellion. Night shots with smoke or blurred lights will amplify the rebellious mood.“Man in long wool coat and scarf, walking through snowy streets at night, soft golden lamplight, warm and emotional K-drama winter romance aesthetic.”Nothing says K-drama romance like snowy streets. Choose a thick wool coat, neutral tones, and a cosy scarf. Walk naturally while the camera captures motion, making the scene look effortless. Street lamps or fairy lights will add that magical, heartwarming winter glow.“Sharp-dressed man in modern business suit, seated in a luxury office chair with city skyline in background, confident pose, K-drama corporate romance style.”This look is all about power and elegance. Opt for a modern grey or navy suit with a tie. Sit with legs crossed or lean slightly forward with an intense gaze. A glass office backdrop with the city skyline makes the shot look polished and professional, perfect for a corporate romance vibe.“Man in casual black t-shirt and leather jacket, running through dimly lit alley with blurred motion, tense expression, cinematic thriller vibe.”Inspired by action-heavy dramas, this prompt works best with a darker setting. A leather jacket layered over casual wear creates a rugged look. Capture motion blur while running or looking back over your shoulder to add suspense. Keep your expression intense and focused to channel the hero-on-the-run energy.“Man in simple sweater, sitting alone by a window with a coffee cup, natural light falling on face, contemplative expression, soft K-drama slice-of-life mood.”For a softer, reflective mood, keep styling minimal, plain sweaters, muted colours, and natural light. Sit by a café window with a coffee or book, gazing thoughtfully outside. The expression should be calm, almost melancholic, showing emotional depth. This captures the quiet storytelling charm of slice-of-life dramas.K-drama heroes captivate audiences not just with dialogue but with how their scenes look, stylish, emotional, and cinematic. By using these Gemini prompts, you can style your photos to reflect those same moods. From powerful CEO vibes to snowy romance or gritty survival, each look tells its own story. Experiment with different lighting, backdrops, and expressions until you find the vibe that feels most like your own K-drama moment. With the right combination, your photos won’t just be pictures—they’ll be scenes from your own drama. Adding props, subtle colour grading, and dynamic poses can enhance the cinematic feel even further. Try incorporating movement, such as walking shots or wind effects, to add depth and authenticity. These small touches can make your images feel straight out of a high-budget drama. Including creative framing techniques, dramatic shadows, and layering foreground elements can intensify visual storytelling, while playful use of reflections, mirrors, or soft focus adds a dreamy, cinematic atmosphere that brings your photos closer to K-drama perfection.","K-dramas are visual masterpieces that shape global fashion, photography, and lifestyle trends.

Dubai launches global AI film competition



How creators can compete for the $1 million prize



Registration Start Date: 23 September 2025

Deadline: 20 November 2025

Eligibility and themes: What the rules really say

Who Can Enter: Open to creators worldwide. Only individual creators may apply (though teams can support the work) and entrants must be active social media content creators. Corporate or institutional entries are not allowed

Film Duration & Technical Formatting: Video length should be 7–10 minutes. Any language is allowed, but English subtitles are mandatory. Professional editing and clear sound quality required and subtitles must be accurate and properly synced



AI Tool Usage & Requirements: At least 70% of the film must be AI-generated. Participants Must use Google Gemini tools (Veo, Imagen, Flow) as the main AI engine. Other tools may be used for sound, editing, or minor visuals. Entrants may need to show which sections were created using Gemini.



Themes to Choose From: “Rewrite Tomorrow” (envisioning a hopeful or alternative future) or “The Secret Life Of” (revealing hidden stories behind everyday life) Entries must strictly align with one theme.





From entry rules to winner announcement - Timeline

Prize Money and Global Exposure for Winners

Grand Prize: $1,000,000 for the best AI film.



Finalist Benefits: The top 5 films will premiere at the 1 Billion Followers Summit before tens of thousands of creators, investors, and media leaders.



Industry Recognition: Winners and finalists gain exposure across international platforms and join Dubai’s growing Dh50 million creators accelerator fund ecosystem.

What you should pay attention to

Balancing AI and human input: Although AI must generate at least 70%, human creativity still has to shape the film, the storytelling, voice, editing, composition. AI tools are enablers, not replacements.



Ethical transparency: Be clear about which Gemini tools you used and how. If you use other tools or external footage, cite or document them. In some sources they say you may be asked to supply open files.



Theme execution over superficial references: It’s not enough to attach a theme name. Judges will look for depth — does your film really “rewrite tomorrow” with new ideas, or does it just slap on futuristic visuals? Does “The Secret Life Of” go deeper than just showing something hidden does it evoke empathy, surprise, insight?



Language / subtitles: English subtitles are required even if your dialogue is in another language. Poor subtitle translation or missing subtitles can hurt.



One entry per individual: While some sources say one entry per individual, others allow multiple entries (but maybe in different genres?). You’ll need to double-check this in the full criteria.



Public vote matters: Being shortlisted means you’ll go through public voting. So a film that appeals to audiences (not just art/AI enthusiasts) may have an edge. Think about clarity, emotional hook, shareability.

The cycle of day and night governs life on Earth, but in some regions, a remarkable phenomenon occurs where the sun never sets for weeks or even months at a time. Known as the midnight sun, this happens in latitudes above the Arctic Circle (66.56°N) and below the Antarctic Circle (66.56°S) during their respective summer seasons. During this extraordinary period, the sun remains visible even at midnight, creating endless daylight and a dreamlike atmosphere. While constant sunlight can disrupt sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, and overall biological balance, it also encourages outdoor activities, cultural festivals, social gatherings, and unique adventures. Residents and travellers alike experience a surreal, brightly sunlit environment that transforms daily life, boosts tourism, and expands recreational opportunities in fascinating ways.Norway, renowned for its dramatic fjords and Viking heritage, is a top destination to witness the midnight sun. At the North Cape, the sun remains visible for almost two months in summer. The long daylight hours allow travellers to engage in outdoor adventures like midnight golfing, hiking, and photography. Norwegian culture combines modern social systems with historic pride, and locals make the most of these endless days for festivals, barbecues, and communal activities.The midnight sun offers both an immersive natural experience and an insight into Norway’s rich cultural landscape.Alaska, often called America’s Last Frontier, covers over 663,000 square miles and is famous for its Aurora Borealis and rugged wilderness. In summer, regions such as Anchorage and northern Alaska experience prolonged daylight, allowing activities typically reserved for the day to continue late into the night. Residents often adjust sleep schedules to accommodate the extra sunlight, while visitors enjoy hiking, kayaking, and wildlife watching at unconventional hours. The midnight sun marks a transition from harsh winters to vibrant summer life, highlighting Alaska’s awe-inspiring natural beauty.Located above the Arctic Circle, Norilsk is the northernmost city of significant population, with around 180,000 residents. This mining town, rich in nickel and coal deposits, experiences the midnight sun for months. Though access is restricted for non-Russian citizens, the city offers a glimpse into human resilience in extreme conditions. Brutalist architecture dominates the landscape, prioritising functionality over aesthetics. Despite the harsh environment, the region benefits from prolonged daylight, aiding productivity and mental well-being during the sunlit summer months.Finland, a land of lakes, forests, and rich culture, enjoys months of continuous daylight in the far north. The midnight sun encourages outdoor activities, creativity, and social gatherings. Finnish culture, including its famous sauna traditions, thrives under the summer sun, while the abundance of light has influenced cuisine and lifestyle. Historically, Finland has been settled for over 13,000 years, and its northerly residents are adept at making the most of the long days, blending productivity with cultural and recreational pursuits.Northern Sweden, part of the Land of the Midnight Sun, experiences nearly continuous daylight in summer. This country is celebrated for its Renaissance architecture, expansive lakes, and peaceful way of life. Locals use the extra light to engage in outdoor sports, festivals, and cultural events. The extended sunlight has social and psychological benefits, encouraging a sense of community and active living. With only 13% of the population living in the frozen north, visitors can explore serene landscapes under the extraordinary summer sunlight.Iceland, situated just south of the Arctic Circle, experiences the midnight sun predominantly in June. Known for volcanoes, geysers, waterfalls, and glaciers, Iceland’s natural beauty is amplified by continuous daylight. Seljalandsfoss waterfall, photographed at 1 am, is a prime example of how the sun transforms familiar landscapes into magical scenes. Icelanders celebrate this phenomenon with outdoor festivals, midnight swims, and cultural events, embracing the unique energy and vibrancy it brings to daily life.Greenland, an island mostly covered by ice, enjoys continuous summer sunlight along its coastal regions. Nuuk, the capital, and surrounding towns celebrate the midnight sun with outdoor activities, fishing, and skiing. Despite extreme environmental conditions, locals adapt their routines to make the most of extended daylight. Historically, settlers named it “Greenland” to encourage immigration, yet today, the sunlit summer months offer relaxation, recreation, and a rare opportunity to witness one of Earth’s most extreme natural phenomena.In Canada’s Nunavut, Yukon, and Northwest Territories, the summer sun barely sets. Indigenous Inuit communities have lived with these extreme day-night cycles for centuries, developing lifestyles and traditions attuned to prolonged daylight. Visitors experience almost 24 hours of sunlight, perfect for hiking, wildlife watching, and cultural exploration. The midnight sun not only illuminates Canada’s rugged Arctic landscapes but also provides insight into indigenous adaptations and sustainable living in extreme northern conditions.Although mostly uninhabited, Antarctica experiences the midnight sun during its summer months (November to January). Research stations, seals, penguins, and other wildlife endure continuous daylight. Scientists take advantage of prolonged sun exposure to conduct fieldwork, while the landscape showcases towering ice shelves, glaciers, and pristine expanses. Unlike the northern hemisphere, the southern polar day occurs during the northern winter, offering a fascinating contrast in Earth’s seasonal cycles.","In some regions, the sun never sets for weeks or even months at a time.

Nature can be strange, surprising, and downright unbelievable. From showers of fish and frogs to blood-red rain and snow in the Sahara, the world has witnessed phenomena that seem straight out of a fantasy. Rare lightning orbs, frost flowers in polar seas, and even fire rainbows paint a vivid picture of how extraordinary weather and environmental events can be.These astonishing events are not just curiosities—they reveal the incredible power of nature, from violent storms and volcanic eruptions to microscopic spores and ice crystals. Across continents and oceans, humans have stared in awe as the impossible unfolds above, below, and all around them.In the small town of Yoro, Honduras, residents witness an astonishing event almost every year called Lluvia de Peces (“Rain of Fish”). During heavy storms, strong winds or waterspouts lift fish from nearby rivers or ponds, dropping them over streets and fields. Locals often collect the fish afterward, calling it a blessing. While anecdotal, scientists suggest that tornado-like wind systems during intense storms can carry fish over short distances, creating the seemingly impossible spectacle.This unique phenomenon has been reported for decades, often in late spring and summer when storms are strongest.Though the Sahara Desert is famed for its scorching sands, rare snowfalls have been recorded in 1979, 2016, and 2018. Cold air from northern regions combines with local atmospheric moisture, leading to brief snow showers over sand dunes. Temperatures can drop dramatically overnight, allowing snow to settle on the golden dunes, creating a surreal white-on-gold landscape. These snow events are short-lived, often melting within hours under the desert sun, but they captivate observers worldwide.After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, survivors reported black rain falling over the devastated city. The soot-laden precipitation formed as radioactive dust and debris mixed with atmospheric moisture. This rain caused further contamination and injuries, darkening streets and clothes. Documented extensively by historians and scientists, it is a tragic example of how human-made disasters can produce extraordinary natural effects, where precipitation carries harmful particles, creating both visual and lethal consequences for affected populations. Black rain continued in pockets for several days after the blast.During eruptions at Japan’s Mount Sakurajima and other volcanoes, lightning has been observed striking within volcanic ash clouds. The phenomenon occurs as friction between ash particles creates static electricity, igniting bolts in the thick, smoke-filled sky. Photographers have captured these electric displays erupting alongside fiery lava and dense volcanic plumes, producing a spectacular mix of natural fire and electricity.In Kerala in 2001, residents observed rainfall that appeared blood-red. Scientific analysis revealed that the red particles were spores from local algae. Heavy showers carried these spores from rivers or ponds, giving the rain its dramatic crimson hue. The unusual downpour drew global attention, sparking curiosity and myths about extraterrestrial origins. This phenomenon lasted several weeks, mostly in July and August, during the monsoon season. It remains a well-documented natural event that illustrates how microscopic biological particles can dramatically alter the colour of rainwater, creating a striking, surreal visual effect.Ball lightning is an extremely rare phenomenon where glowing, spherical orbs of electricity appear during thunderstorms, moving unpredictably and sometimes entering buildings before vanishing. Scientists still debate the exact causes, but the balls are thought to form from high-voltage electrical discharges combined with atmospheric moisture. Reports exist across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Witnesses often describe them hovering, bouncing, or rolling across floors, radiating bright, bluish-white light.In 2005, a small Serbian town reported frogs falling from the sky during a torrential downpour. Meteorologists explained that strong winds, updrafts, or waterspouts likely lifted the amphibians from nearby ponds or rivers, carrying them several kilometres before depositing them onto streets and gardens. Residents were startled by the hopping creatures showering down with rain. Similar events have occurred in the United States and Europe.Across the US, tornadoes have occasionally been documented lifting fish from lakes and ponds, depositing them miles away in fields or towns. During intense twisters, the swirling winds can carry lightweight aquatic animals, creating the bizarre phenomenon of raining fish. Meteorological folklore records multiple such instances, especially in states like Florida and Louisiana, where waterspouts form over lakes or coastal waters.Frost flowers are delicate ice crystals that form on sea ice or polar regions under extreme cold and calm conditions. They grow when supercooled water vapor rises and freezes on the surface of newly formed ice, creating intricate, flower-like structures. Observed in the Arctic, Antarctic, and polar seabeds, these frost flowers reflect light, often sparkling in the low sun. They play a role in releasing salts and trace chemicals into the atmosphere and marine ecosystems.Fire rainbows, or circumhorizontal arcs, occur when sunlight passes through ice crystals in high-altitude cirrus clouds at a specific angle, creating rainbow-like streaks in the sky. They are extremely rare and require precise conditions, often appearing during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike normal rainbows, they are horizontal and have vivid, flame-like colours. Fire rainbows have been spotted in the US, Europe, and Asia, often photographed by skywatchers.","In Honduras, strong winds or waterspouts lift fish from nearby rivers or ponds, dropping them over streets and fields.

Key cultural and social themes of this year’s celebrations include:

Unity and national pride among Emirati citizens.

Inclusion and participation of the UAE’s large expatriate community, invited to take part in public festivities.

A continued emphasis on modernity integrated with tradition, evident in the use of drone shows and digital storytelling alongside heritage performances.





The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2. Authorities have officially declared December 2 and 3 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as public holidays, with strong speculation that December 1 (Monday) may also be granted as a holiday—potentially creating a four- or even five-day weekend. As the country marks more than half a century of union, preparations are underway for one of the largest Eid Al Etihad commemorations to date, blending deep-rooted cultural traditions with high-tech spectacles across the seven emirates.The UAE Cabinet has confirmed December 2 and 3, 2025 as official public holidays in honour of Eid Al Etihad, or Festival of the Union, commemorating the founding of the nation on December 2, 1971. With these days falling on a Tuesday and Wednesday, the inclusion of Monday, December 1, as a holiday could extend the break to four days, or possibly five depending on the weekend alignment.This potential long weekend is expected to benefit both social and economic activities. Residents and families will have more time to travel within the country, participate in public festivities, or take advantage of the extended holiday period for leisure or short-term vacations.Authorities have not yet officially confirmed the exact status of December 1, but based on prior years and UAE holiday policies, there is growing anticipation that an official announcement will likely follow soon.The UAE’s 54th National Day celebrations are set to feature a series of expansive and coordinated events across all emirates, with major public and private venues playing host to cultural, entertainment, and community-focused programs.These innovations highlight the UAE’s unique fusion of cultural heritage and modern innovation.Public transportation services across major cities are expected to extend operational hours, while law enforcement and municipal bodies are preparing traffic and safety protocols to manage the anticipated increase in footfall at celebration venues.At the centre of the celebrations will be a grand official ceremony on Tuesday, December 2, to be attended by the UAE’s leadership. While the venue for the main event has not yet been revealed, organisers have confirmed it will be a site of deep cultural and national relevance.In 2024, the ceremony was held at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, where the nation’s heritage and vision for the future were presented through immersive storytelling and performances. A similarly meaningful location is expected to be selected for the 2025 event, and details are expected to be made public in the coming weeks.Preparations officially began on Union Pledge Day, proudly marking the symbolic start of a nationwide effort to build an inclusive, celebratory experience that truly reflects the UAE’s core values of unity and diversity.The 54th National Day serves as a reminder of the UAE’s evolution from its unification in 1971 into a global centre for innovation, commerce, and cross-cultural engagement. Eid Al Etihad is not only a time of celebration but also of reflection—honouring the nation’s history while highlighting its ambitions for the future.Organisers have also released behind-the-scenes footage from the 2024 ceremony, showcasing the depth of planning and artistic execution that goes into these annual events. The footage aims to build excitement and demonstrate the UAE’s commitment to making National Day a culturally resonant and visually compelling occasion.On the economic front, long public holidays like these are known to boost local tourism and retail sectors, with increased activity in hotels, restaurants, and shopping destinations. Travel agencies typically report a spike in bookings, as residents look to make the most of the extended break for domestic or short international getaways. This year’s celebrations are also expected to set new records in tourism and retail spending, reflecting the growing impact of National Day on the UAE’s economy.","The United Arab Emirates is preparing for an especially elaborate celebration of its 54th National Day, observed annually on December 2.

New UAE school rules 2025: What parents must know about the ban on online food deliveries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-uae-school-rules-2025-what-parents-must-know-about-the-ban-on-online-food-deliveries/articleshow/124063276.cms,"Schools across the UAE have introduced a new rule: no more online food deliveries for students during school hours. Food apps like Talabat, Noon and Deliveroo can no longer drop meals at school gates, with education authorities pushing the change to improve child nutrition and safety.





UAE schools ban online food deliveries: New rules, dates and who is affected



Why UAE schools stopped food delivery apps: Health, safety and academic reasons



Nutrition and health: Most app-ordered meals are fast food, high in fat, sugar and salt, and not aligned with UAE health standards. Limiting deliveries helps promote balanced eating habits.

Food safety: Unlike school canteens, delivery food doesn’t undergo municipal or health inspections. This raises risks of poor handling, contamination, or undeclared allergens.

Student focus: Ordering and receiving food during school hours disrupts lessons. Authorities highlight that well-planned meals improve focus, energy and classroom performance.

Security and safeguarding: Limiting who can access school premises reduces unnecessary outside interaction, ensuring a safer environment for children.

How UAE schools will enforce the online food delivery ban and what parents should do



No app deliveries accepted: Schools will no longer accept food from delivery drivers, even if parents place an order.

Parent handover only: If a child forgets their lunch, parents can bring food to the school reception. In some schools, parents must also sign an undertaking form.

Canteens as the primary source: Approved canteens that meet Dubai Municipality, ADEK and Ministry of Health guidelines will provide meals, ensuring no student is left without food.

Special dietary needs: Parents of children with allergies or medical conditions are encouraged to coordinate directly with the school to make arrangements.

Healthy lunchbox ideas and parent tips after UAE school delivery ban



Plan the night before: Pack lunches in the evening to save morning stress.

Aim for balance: Include protein (eggs, chicken, hummus), whole-grain carbs (brown bread, wraps, rice), fruits, and vegetables.

Hydrate smartly: Send a reusable water bottle instead of sugary drinks.

Label containers: Add your child’s name and class to avoid mix-ups.

Involve children: Let them choose snacks or help pack to reduce fussiness.

Check with canteens: Schools are open to providing alternatives if students have dietary restrictions.

Chicken and avocado wrap + carrot sticks + apple slices

Hummus with whole-grain pita + cucumber and tomato salad + orange

Yogurt with granola + boiled egg + berries

What’s next: Compliance, canteens and parent concerns







Schools across the UAE have moved to stop online food deliveries to students during school hours, citing child safety and a push to promote healthier eating habits. Abu Dhabi’s Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) led the change ahead of the new school year, and several major school groups in Dubai have issued circulars telling parents that delivery apps such as Talabat and Noon are not allowed.Abu Dhabi’s education authority introduced updated nutrition rules that explicitly prohibit external food deliveries to schools during operating hours, with the policy taking effect from the start of the academic year on 25 August 2025. The directive forms part of broader measures to tighten school nutrition policies across the emirate.In Dubai and other Emirates, leading school operators (including GEMS and several private schools) have circulated similar internal notices: online delivery services are strictly not allowed, and some schools require parents who bring food to do so in person at reception and sign an undertaking form. Examples named in reporting include Talabat and Noon among the banned delivery options.Authorities cite several key reasons for banning deliveries:The new rules are being enforced through several measures:For parents, the shift means planning ahead and avoiding reliance on quick app orders.To adapt to the new policy, parents can focus on simple, balanced and easy-to-prepare meals. Practical tips include:Example lunchbox combos:The ban is expected to bring smoother meal management in schools, but it also comes with questions from parents. Some worry about picky eaters, time pressures at home, or affordability of canteen food. Schools and education authorities are assuring parents that canteens will continue to improve menus to make meals healthier and more appealing, No child will go hungry; schools will provide alternatives if lunches are forgotten, Feedback channels remain open so parents can raise concerns about menu choices or dietary needs. Ultimately, the initiative is less about limiting choice and more about building healthier habits, safer campuses, and stronger focus in classrooms.","Schools across the UAE have introduced a new rule: no more online food deliveries for students during school hours. Food apps like Talabat, Noon and Deliveroo can no longer drop meals at school gates. Education authorities are pushing the change to improve child nutrition and safety.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124063666,imgsize-1288589,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-schools-ban-online-food-deliveries.jpg"

Why a UAE Licence matters









Getting a driving licence in the UAE is now easier and more accessible than ever, thanks to recent updates that allow 17-year-olds to apply for permits. Whether you’re planning to ride a motorcycle, drive a car, operate a heavy vehicle, or even become a bus driver, the process is clearly laid out, from eligibility and documents to theory lessons, practical training, tests, and costs. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide to everything you need to know about obtaining your driving licence in the UAE.The UAE issues licences based on vehicle type, with specific age thresholds for each category:Until 2025, applicants could only begin lessons at 17.5 years and had to wait until turning 18 to receive their licence. A new federal decree law passed in October 2024 lowered the minimum age to 17, making the UAE the first GCC country to introduce this change.This update aims to create a new generation of safe, responsible drivers by instilling road safety habits earlier and offering young residents greater independence and mobility.Anyone who is a UAE citizen or resident, of the legal minimum age, and medically fit can apply. Here’s what you’ll need to get started:Here’s how the process unfolds in most Emirates (small variations may apply):Depending on your emirate, you must register with an approved driving school.The total cost of obtaining a UAE driving licence generally falls between AED 4,500 and AED 7,000 (approximately $1,226–1,907), depending on the emirate and the driving school you choose. This amount typically covers theory and practical training fees, the mandatory eye test, as well as all test and licence issuance charges. Once you’ve applied, you can easily check the status of your licence online, Dubai residents can do so via the RTA Dubai website, while applicants in other emirates can use the Ministry of Interior, Abu Dhabi Police, or TAMM platforms.Even with Dubai’s robust public transport network, many residents rely on personal cars for daily commutes. A UAE licence is also essential for renting a car, handy for those who don’t own one.The streamlined process, early eligibility, and rigorous testing ensure that drivers are well-prepared for the road — helping maintain safety standards across the country.","Driving without a licence in the UAE attracts heavy fines, so complete the process fully before getting behind the wheel.

UAE–Nvidia AI and robotics lab: Operational structure, rollout and future expansion









Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has partnered with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to establish the Middle East’s first joint AI research facility. This strategic collaboration marks a significant milestone in the UAE’s growing efforts to become a global force in artificial intelligence and robotics innovation.The newly launched joint research lab, officially called the TII–Nvidia AI Technology Centre (NVAITC), is located in Abu Dhabi and represents the first of its kind in the Middle East. This collaboration brings together TII’s multidisciplinary research expertise in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous systems, and high-performance computing, with Nvidia’s advanced AI models and accelerated computing platforms.According to TII CEO Dr. Najwa Aaraj, the lab will focus on the development of next-generation AI models, humanoid technologies, robotics platforms, and intelligent systems capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.The partnership is designed to integrate advanced robotic platforms with cutting-edge AI tools, driving progress in areas such as:This lab also marks a pivotal shift in the region’s AI landscape as it’s the first time Nvidia’s NVAITC network is expanding into robotics in the Middle East.Carlo Ruiz, Nvidia's VP of Enterprise Solutions and Operations for EMEA, highlighted that the initiative aims to accelerate real-world breakthroughs in intelligent systems.A major highlight of the collaboration is the use of Nvidia’s Thor chip, a powerful edge GPU designed specifically for advanced robotic systems development. This chip, which TII will newly incorporate into its projects, is expected to play a crucial role in accelerating robotic innovation.TII is currently conducting R&D on a diverse portfolio of robotic systems, including:By leveraging the Thor chip and Nvidia’s computing infrastructure, TII aims to advance both the hardware and AI software integration of its robotic systems, with a focus on enabling these machines to reason, adapt, and act autonomously in real-time.Additionally, TII has already been using Nvidia’s chips to train its proprietary Falcon large language model (LLM) family, which is part of the UAE’s broader efforts to build national AI capabilities.This lab launch fits into the UAE’s long-term vision to become a global hub for artificial intelligence and advanced technologies. The country’s AI strategy is structured around several national frameworks:Earlier in 2025, the UAE and U.S. governments signed the AI Acceleration Partnership, reinforcing cooperation on critical technologies and announcing a joint initiative for a 5-gigawatt UAE–US AI Campus.This broader geopolitical backdrop also included a multi-billion-dollar agreement — signed during former U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Gulf in May — to build one of the world’s largest data centre hubs in Abu Dhabi, powered by U.S. technologies and advanced Nvidia chips. However, the finalisation of this deal has faced delays, reportedly due to security concerns related to the UAE’s ties with China.Discussions to establish the joint lab began approximately a year ago. Now operational, the facility will be staffed by a dedicated team comprising experts from both TII and Nvidia. Additional hiring is underway to expand the project-specific workforce and support the lab's ongoing research objectives.The lab will serve as a central node in Nvidia’s global NVAITC network, and a regional hub for applied research, particularly in real-world AI and robotics deployments. It aims to not only support innovation but also contribute directly to the development of intelligent machines and systems with high levels of autonomy and functional complexity.","Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has partnered with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to establish the Middle East’s first joint AI research facility.

To reduce administrative delays and prevent duplicate applications, Kuwait ’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a new visa pre-verification feature for domestic workers (Visa 20) via the Sahel app. The move is part of a broader push to digitize services, enhance transparency, and streamline regulatory compliance in labor and immigration processes.The Ministry of Interior recently launched a new tool on the unified Sahel application, enabling users to verify whether a visa has already been issued for a particular domestic worker before they proceed with recruitment. This is aimed at avoiding common errors such as duplicate applications, which often result in delays or outright rejections.The feature focuses specifically on the Visa 20 category, which applies to foreign nationals working as domestic staff — including maids, drivers, and household helpers, under the sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen or resident.By making this verification step available through Sahel, the Ministry aims to:This marks a step forward in Kuwait’s efforts to introduce tech-driven improvements in a sector that remains both sensitive and complex, particularly in terms of labor rights and regulatory oversight.The Domestic Worker Visa (Visa 20) is the standard visa used by Kuwaiti households to hire full-time domestic staff. Designed for roles such as maids, drivers, and nannies, this visa category is structured to support households that require assistance with day-to-day domestic work.To apply for this visa, sponsors are required to submit a comprehensive set of documents:This visa is considered the preferred legal route for Kuwaitis and residents looking to hire household help from abroad. The newly added verification step on Sahel ensures that employers do not unknowingly begin the hiring process for workers who already have active visa entries, thus saving time and preventing legal complications.The Sahel App, first launched in 2021, is a mobile platform developed as part of Kuwait’s national digital transformation initiative. It allows citizens and residents to access a wide array of e-government services from multiple ministries and agencies, including:Services available on Sahel include:The app is designed for accessibility, available in both Arabic and English, with the English version launched in 2024 by the Minister of State for Communication Affairs, Omar Al-Omar. This bilingual approach broadens accessibility to the expatriate community and reflects Kuwait’s commitment to inclusive digital services.Additionally, the platform is built with high standards of data security and user authentication, ensuring that personal information remains protected while allowing for seamless, real-time interactions with government systems.Beyond the updates to Sahel and Visa 20 processes, other regulatory efforts are also underway across Kuwait:The Supreme Committee for the Investigation of Kuwaiti Citizenship, led by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Fahad Al Yousef Saud Al Sabah, convened recently and disclosed a set of cases involving the revocation of Kuwaiti citizenship.Grounds for these actions included:The committee emphasized that all actions were taken in the “higher interest of the country” and confirmed that these cases would now be forwarded to the Kuwaiti Cabinet for final approval.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

iOS26 now available: Things to know





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that he once turned down an early model of a luxury timepiece worth over half a million dollars and opted for its prototype instead because of his self-described ""builder"" persona. The Facebook-co-founder revealed the choice during an interview with the platform Drip, where he showcased his Greubel Forsey Nano Foudroyante watch, which retails for around $585,000.According to a report by Business Insider, the Swiss watchmaker's creation was a limited-edition piece, with only 22 timepieces available at its debut.“They said that if I wanted, I could get one of the early ones that they made,” Zuckerberg explained.“I'm more of a work-in-progress, builder type of person, so I actually just asked them if I could get the prototype,” he added, noting that he was unsure if the company normally accommodates such requests but that they “figured out how to do that for me.”The Nano Foudroyante is Greubel Forsey's 10th “Fundamental Invention” and is notable for its intricate “foudroyante” complication, a subdial that measures fractions of a second with a hand completing one revolution per second.The watch is also a feat of engineering, as it is designed to be significantly more energy-efficient than traditional models.Zuckerberg's watch collection is extensive, ranging from a humble $120 Casio to a flashy yellow-gold Rolex. The Nano Foudroyante is not his only Greubel Forsey timepiece; he also owns a Hand Made 1, which has a reported value of $900,000.Last year, a video went viral on social media, showing Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, having a conversation with Anant when Chan noticed his wristwatch.“That is cool,” Chan said, to which Zuckerberg responded, ""I know. I told him already."" She then asked Anant, ""Who makes that?"" Anant replied that the watch was a Richard Mille.Zuckerberg seemed particularly impressed by the timepiece. ""I never really wanted to get a watch. But..."" he said, showing his appreciation, as Priscilla added, ""I might want that.""","The Nano Foudroyante is Greubel Forsey's 10th “Fundamental Invention” and is notable for its intricate “foudroyantes” complication.

iOS26 now available: Things to know





LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman has shared his unique and costly approach to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI): he simply uses every AI chatbot and he pays for the maximum, most expensive subscription. This cumulatively can cost at least $650 per month (approx Rs 57,700).During a recent appearance on the ""Moonshots with Peter Diamandis"" podcast, Hoffman, a prominent venture capitalist, disclosed that he pays for the maximum subscription across all leading AI tools.“I simply do the max subscription across all of them and frequently when I'm doing something I've actually already put on running — and now it's the Open AI open-source model on my laptop to front end to parsing it out to multiple agents,” Hoffman said.This strategy, which he calls his “personal AI hack,” involves taking a single prompt and feeding it to multiple agents, including ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Claude. He then integrates the various responses for more substantive tasks.""Run it on ChatGPT, run it on Copilot, run it on Gemini, run it on Claude, and then integrating what comes back on anything that is kind of more substantive,"" he said.When asked by podcast cofounder Dave Blundin if his position as a Microsoft board member granted him special access or dedicated GPUs, Hoffman said it does not.He instead relies on his subscription-based workflow, which can cost at least $650 per month, not including the cost of Microsoft's Copilot and an Office 365 license.This high-cost approach is not without its limits, according to Hoffman.“I've got the personal hack, but not the personal cloud,” he said, suggesting that true, private AI infrastructure remains out of reach, even for someone with his resources.He previously revealed he uses AI for ""deep research"" once a day, and even to help him formulate better questions. His process involves writing or speaking a paragraph to an AI, which then generates a detailed, refined prompt that he can use to drive his research.","LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman has shared his unique approach to leveraging artificial intelligence.
