From: Steve Jobs, sjobs@apple.com To: Steve Jobs, sjobs@apple.com

Date: Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 11:08PM

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Apple founder Steve Jobs wrote a personal and moving email to himself just a year before his death. The email which offers a glimpse into the mind of the Apple visionary has now resurfaced online.

How Lucy Guo learnt to earn money as a kid

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Lucy Guo , world's youngest self-made billionaire and serial entrepreneur, credits her frugal parents with motivating her to start hustling at a young age. Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Her first company, Scale AI, an AI data-labeling firm, was acquired by tech giant Meta for a whopping $25 billion.Today, Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022. She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019 to invest in early-stage tech startups. Growing up in Fremont, California, with Chinese immigrant parents, Guo was taught the importance of both education and money. ""They threw me into Abacus competitions,"" she told CNBC Make It, adding that she was ""definitely forced to have good academics.""Her focus on academics led her to study computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. However, she dropped out after two years, with only a year left to complete her Computer Science degree. This decision was a major disappointment for her parents.""They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,"" Guo explained. ""For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.""Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship , a program that provides young people with $200,000 to build innovative companies. ""I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them,"" she said, ""when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.""Lucy Guo’s parents lived ""a very frugal life,"" but always emphasized the importance of having money. As a result, she started hustling in elementary school. ""I would find ways to make money on the playground,"" she said. This included trading and selling Pokémon cards, colored pencils, and ""anything I could find.""Her parents were strict, and if she misbehaved, they would take her money away. In response, Guo, in second grade, went to Home Depot to get a debit card and opened a PayPal account to store her cash.As the years went on, her money-making endeavors grew. A fan of the game Neopets, she would sell virtual creatures and in-game currency on forums. ""I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,"" she said.After discovering engineering and coding, she began making and selling bots to cheat in games. From there, her ventures ""snowballed."" ""I then started finding other ways to make money on the internet from making websites using Google AdSense, then creating internet marketing tools...it just snowballed from there,"" she is quoted as saying.","Lucy Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

On the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality. The International Astronomical Centre will stream the entire celestial event live from Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory, making it accessible to a global audience.The International Astronomical Centre confirmed that it will livestream the total lunar eclipse using a telescope stationed at the Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory. The broadcast is scheduled to run for more than four hours, from, providing uninterrupted real-time coverage of the phenomenon.According to Engineer Mohammed Shawkat Odah, Director of the International Astronomical Centre, the eclipse will unfold in several distinct stages:Odah noted that the most visually dramatic period — when the Moon turns a striking shade of red — will last 82 minutes, making it one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent years. This stage, known as totality, will be clearly visible to the naked eye across all seven emirates from 9:30 PM to 10:52 PM GST.Additionally, Odah stated that the phenomenon can be observed at different stages across the Arab region depending on geographic location:A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow (umbra) onto the Moon. During this alignment, sunlight passes through Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red tones to reach the Moon’s surface. This atmospheric refraction creates the phenomenon commonly known as a Blood Moon.Two aspects make tonight’s event particularly remarkable:The Moon will not completely disappear during totality. Instead, it will take on shades of orange, red, or yellow, depending on atmospheric conditions. According to Odah, the color intensity is a reflection of atmospheric purity. Increased pollution, for instance, can cause the Moon to appear dark red or brown. In rare instances, such as the December 12, 1992 eclipse (influenced by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines), the Moon has vanished entirely from view during totality.The total eclipse phase, where the Moon is fully immersed in the Earth’s umbra, will be. The timings for the totality are consistent nationwide:The Moon’s changing appearance, from bright white to glowing red, will be clearly visible without the need for telescopes, although observatories and livestreams will offer detailed views.Looking ahead, skywatchers in the UAE can mark their calendars for future lunar events:The next total eclipse will coincide with New Year’s Eve, setting the stage for another dramatic Blood Moon — this time, during year-end celebrations.","On September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality.

Marjorie Greene Demand Ban On Indian Work Visas Amid Tariff Tensions

A flashpoint for a nation on edge

'This is America'

The fault lines of a changing America

A neighborhood or a battleground?





A shaky, 47-second cellphone video filmed from inside a parked car has lit a cultural fuse deep in the heart of Texas, and the explosion is still echoing across the internet.In the footage, recorded in a quiet Dallas suburb, a group of neighbors can be seen joyfully playing traditional Indian drums and dancing in the street, celebrating what appears to be a local festival. But it's not the celebration that caught national attention, it’s the bitter outrage of the man behind the camera.“Typical view in my neighborhood outside Dallas,” wrote Daniel Keene as he posted the clip to X, formerly known as Twitter. “We have to cancel the H1-Bs. I want my kids to grow up in America. Not India.”What followed was a firestorm.Within hours, the post had racked up hundreds of thousands of views, and then millions. But it wasn’t just a viral video. It was a spark in a dry forest. Keene’s comments, which went on to describe his neighborhood as “overrun by Indians” and likened evening strolls to “walking the streets of Mumbai,” exposed raw tensions simmering beneath the surface of suburban America.In the video’s comment thread, the mask of civility fell off. What began as a neighborhood gripe erupted into a full-blown ideological war over what it means to be American.“There seems to be a celebration every month,” Keene complained. “The neighborhood is easily 70% Indian now, and it was not this way until recently.”But while Keene’s remarks were applauded by some, many were quick to call out what they described as blatant racism wrapped in nostalgia.“This is my America,” one user replied. “I chose to live in a predominantly Indian neighborhood in North Texas and it’s been fantastic. It’s like when I grew up in the ’80s, kids playing outside, families walking after dinner, safe schools. What exactly are you afraid of?”Another added, “Maybe instead of filming from behind your window, you could try walking over and saying hello. You’d find world-class hospitality, and you might even learn something.”But not everyone was reaching for common ground. “It’s beyond H-1Bs,” one commenter warned darkly. “We need to actively start repatriating… legals and illegals alike.”Another wrote, “We recently built a house near Austin. Within at least 20 homes of ours, we are the only white family. So far, no issues… but this video doesn’t make me feel good.”What’s playing out online is more than a clash between neighbors, it’s a high-stakes confrontation between two visions of the country’s future. One clings to a vanishing ideal of cultural homogeneity; the other embraces an America that is more diverse, global, and interconnected than ever before.North Texas, like much of suburban America, has undergone rapid demographic transformation over the last decade. The influx of highly skilled workers, particularly from South Asia, has revitalized local economies, boosted school rankings, and introduced new traditions to old neighborhoods.But for some, that transformation feels like displacement.“It’s not the same anymore,” Keene insisted in a follow-up post. “They’ve taken over every suburb.”Priya Malhotra, a second-generation Indian-American who grew up in Dallas, says she’s heartbroken, but not surprised.“We're not trying to replace anyone,” she said. “We’re raising families, working hard, building lives here. But people like this man see a few Indian faces and suddenly it’s not ‘America’ anymore? We belong here too.”The debate, now dominating national headlines, has raised urgent questions about belonging, identity, and what it really means to live side by side in the modern United States.","A video of neighbors celebrating an Indian festival in a Dallas suburb went viral.

A unified vision for land and water mobility





Dubai is advancing its vision of a smarter, more connected city with two major transport projects now underway: the construction of the Dh20.5-billion Dubai Metro Blue Line and the launch of two new marine stations on Dubai Creek. These developments are set to significantly reduce congestion, cut travel times, and boost mobility across key urban and waterfront areas.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line, a massive infrastructure project that will expand the city’s rail network by 30 kilometres and add 14 new stations. As part of the initial works, a key traffic diversion has been introduced near Centrepoint Station, affecting access from Airport Road to the multi-storey car park.Motorists can now reach the car park via 49C Street, making a left turn west of the facility. The RTA has urged drivers to follow all directional signboards, plan trips ahead, and use alternative routes to avoid delays. Similar traffic changes are also in effect near Creek Station, as early construction continues there as well.The Blue Line is expected to open by September 9, 2029, and is designed to carry 46,000 passengers per hour in both directions.It aims to reduce traffic congestion by 20% on the routes it serves, cutting travel time between key residential areas and Dubai International Airport to just 20 minutes.When complete, the Blue Line will extend the total length of the Dubai Metro network to 131km, serving 78 stations and operating 28 trains. The project is expected to generate Dh56 million in profits and carry 200,000 passengers per day by 2030, with that number projected to rise to 320,000 by 2040.These areas are expected to be home to over one million people, as envisioned in the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan.Travel times along the Blue Line will range from 10 to 25 minutes, significantly improving daily commutes for thousands of residents.In a separate milestone, the RTA has also inaugurated two new marine transport stations:Both are strategically located on Dubai Creek and support the RTA’s Marine Transport Strategic Plan 2020–2030, which aims to make water transport a key part of the emirate’s mobility network.These stations follow the design principles of recently upgraded facilities like Bur Dubai and Old Deira Souq, combining modernisation with heritage preservation.The newly opened stations feature enhanced capacity and passenger experience, aligning with upgrades seen across the network, such as the 15% capacity increase at Deira Old Souq Station earlier this year.The stations were completed simultaneously to reduce costs and accelerate delivery, with a new operational plan in place to ensure timely trips, safe navigation, and efficient services.Marine transport ridership is on the rise, with 9.7 million passengers using the network in the first half of 2025 alone — a strong indicator of public confidence in Dubai’s evolving transport infrastructure.Together, the Dubai Metro Blue Line and the new marine stations reflect a city-wide push to create a seamlessly integrated, multimodal transport network. These upgrades are not only addressing current mobility needs but are also being built with future urban growth and sustainability in mind. The RTA is also exploring smart technologies to enhance real-time connectivity and improve overall commuter experience across the transport network.As work progresses, the RTA continues to advise residents and commuters to stay informed about diversions and changes, and to plan travel in advance. Whether by rail or water, Dubai’s transport infrastructure is moving swiftly toward a more connected, efficient, and accessible future.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line.

Communication features disabled in Saudi Arabia and UAE

“The safety and well-being of children online is a top priority... We will continue to work together to ensure a safe, trusted, and positive digital environment for all UAE users, especially children.”

Regional bans and content moderation efforts

Kuwait’s ban was announced on August 21, 2025, following community complaints.



Qatar restricted access on August 13, although the government has not publicly commented.



Turkey blocked the platform on August 7, with Roblox stating it is cooperating with authorities.



Oman and Jordan imposed earlier restrictions, and the game is currently restricted in various degrees across countries like Iraq, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Yemen.





“As part of this vision, and in view of recent discussions with regulatory authorities in a number of countries across the Middle East, we are committing to enhance our Arabic communication and content moderation capabilities.”





Guardian investigation reveals serious safety lapses

Voice and text chat features were accessible even to users listed as under 13, due to easily bypassed age verification mechanisms.



Test avatars registered as children accessed sexually suggestive environments, including virtual hotel rooms, fetish accessories, and public bathrooms that enabled inappropriate roleplay.



Audio from voice chat included explicit sounds like kissing, grunting, and slurping, which the platform’s real-time AI moderation failed to filter.



In one case, an adult avatar was able to solicit Snapchat details from a five-year-old avatar using barely disguised language.





“There are bad actors on the internet... this is an issue that goes beyond Roblox and needs to be addressed through collaboration with governments and an industry-wide commitment to strong safety measures.”

Wider backlash and company response

Launching content tags



Updating parental tools



Increasing in-game moderation staff



Rolling out region-specific language moderation, especially in Arabic-speaking regions





“Our vision is to connect people with optimism and civility... by creating a platform where users of all ages can have a safe, civil and positive experience.”





Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, following mounting regional and global scrutiny over child safety. The move, which affects millions of young users in the Middle East ’s largest gaming markets, comes after discussions with government regulators and follows similar actions in other countries across the region.Roblox, the widely used online gaming and creation platform, has halted all in-experience communication features—including voice and text chat, for users in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The decision was made following talks with regulatory bodies in both nations and is part of a broader push to bolster digital child safety.In Saudi Arabia, the changes were coordinated with the General Authority for Media Regulation, which emphasized its role in protecting the public from the adverse effects of electronic games. According to the regulator, this measure aims to prevent exposure to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and potential online predatory behavior.Meanwhile, in the UAE, the move followed discussions between Roblox and the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). In a joint statement, the TDRA and Roblox said:Both countries have implemented the restrictions effective immediately.Roblox also committed to enhancing its Arabic-language content and introducing stronger moderation tools, including content filters and improved parental controls.The action in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is part of a wider wave of regulatory crackdowns across the Middle East. Several countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey, Oman, Jordan, and others, have already blocked access to Roblox entirely in response to escalating concerns over child safety.Roblox remains accessible in Saudi Arabia, which is considered one of the largest emerging gaming markets in the region. However, the suspension of chat functions marks a significant shift in how the platform is being regulated there.Roblox has stated:A key driver of these policy shifts was an investigation by The Guardian and UK-based research agency Revealing Reality, which exposed critical failures in Roblox’s safety systems, particularly its chat features. The report documented how children as young as five were able to interact with adults inside the platform’s games, often without any effective moderation.Key findings from the investigation include:The researchers concluded that while Roblox advertises itself as a “child-friendly” platform, its safety features are limited in their effectiveness, and the actual in-game experience often contradicts that appearance.In response, Roblox acknowledged:The company also admitted that age verification for under-13 users continues to be an industry-wide challenge.Beyond the Middle East, Roblox has faced increasing legal and public pressure to improve safety controls. In August 2025, Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, accusing it of facilitating the systemic sexual exploitation and abuse of children in the United States.The company has also drawn backlash for banning content creators like Schlep, a vigilante YouTuber known for acting as a self-proclaimed “predator hunter” within the game. Schlep claims to have contributed to the arrest of six suspected predators before being banned by Roblox for violating community guidelines.Roblox has responded with a series of measures:The company reiterated its long-term goal:Despite these efforts, confidence among parents, regulators, and users remains shaken. The recent steps in the UAE and Saudi Arabia mark a turning point in the platform’s ongoing struggle to reconcile its popularity with its responsibility to protect young users.",Roblox has temporarily disabled its in-game voice and text chat features in both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The move comes after discussions with government regulators and follows similar actions in other countries across the region. Roblox also committed to enhancing its Arabic-language content and introducing stronger moderation tools.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123702541,imgsize-1912491,width-400,resizemode-4/uae-saudi-arabia-roblox-ban.jpg"

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

What the new chatter suggests

Prince Andrew Snaps At Staff After Man Reads Aloud Extract From Controversial Biography 'Entitled'

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Amazon-backed Showrunner using AI to recreate 'lost' part of this classic Hollywood movie,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-backed-showrunner-using-ai-to-recreate-lost-part-of-this-classic-hollywood-movie/articleshow/123769719.cms,"What Showrunner said about recreating missing parts of the Hollywood classic with AI



“In general, the estate has embraced AI technology to create a voice model intended to be used for VO work with brands. That said, this attempt to generate publicity on the back of Welles' creative genius is disappointing, especially as we weren't even given the courtesy of a heads up. While AI is inevitable, it still cannot replace the creative instincts resident in the human mind, which means this effort to make Ambersons whole will be a purely mechanical exercise without any of the uniquely innovative thinking or a creative force like Welles.”

Inbase Torque Review: Budget Speaker That Will Surprise You

An Amazon-backed AI firm, Showrunner, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to reconstruct the missing portion of a classic Hollywood movie. The company announced that it will use AI to recreate the lost 43 minutes of footage from the George Orson Welles-starrer 1942 classic film ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" The AI-generated part will compensate for the original footage which was burned by studio executives almost 60 years ago at that time of its initial release.According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (THR), the Showrunner's project will combine AI with traditional film techniques. This includes using live actors and then applying face and pose transfer to preserve the likenesses of the original cast. Archived set photos from the movie will also be used to help rebuild the scenes.Showrunner has confirmed to THR that it will not commercialise the final product, as it does not hold the rights to the Welles film. However, the Welles estate has publicly opposed the project, though it has indicated that AI can be used for voiceover purposes in commercial ventures.In a statement to Variety, a spokesperson for the Welles estate said:The Magnificent Ambersons was Welles’ next project after Citizen Kane , which is often regarded as a landmark film. An older report from 2023 highlighted that the studio reduced Ambersons from 131 minutes to 88 minutes, leaving only 13 out of 73 scenes intact. The missing footage has since drawn strong interest from film enthusiasts eager to experience Welles’ original vision.","Amazon-backed AI firm, Showrunner, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to reconstruct the missing portion of a classic Hollywood movie.
