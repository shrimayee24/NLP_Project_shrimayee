How Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani used the Trump playbook to beat Andrew Cuomo - and become Democratic Mayoral Nominee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-indian-origin-zohran-mamdani-used-the-trump-playbook-to-beat-andrew-cuomo-and-become-democratic-mayoral-nominee/articleshow/122060091.cms,"The Trump of TikTok—Minus the Tan



Trump 2016



Who Is Zohran Mamdani?



Cuomo Brought a Knife to a Meme Fight



What Happens Now?



Why It Matters







In a political shocker that would make Mar-a-Lago jealous, 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani has defeated Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. Armed not with a party machine but a ring light, Mamdani channelled the Trump playbook—minus the racism, plus the rent freeze—and turned vibe into victory.Let’s be clear: this wasn’t a campaign. It was a social-media insurgency, scripted by Karl Marx, shot by Mira Nair, and edited on TikTok.He studied Trump’s script and flipped the ideology.Donald Trump didn’t just break the political mould—he shattered it with a Twitter feed and a MAGA hat. He turned every rally into performance art, every scandal into a storyline, and every insult into a headline. Mamdani took that same understanding—that politics is now pure spectacle—and swapped the anger for aspiration. Like Trump, he didn’t drown voters in policy. He made them feel something. Trump had chants and nicknames. Mamdani had reels and subway beats. Both knew that in an attention economy, coherence is optional—what matters is dominance of the feed. One built a wall of grievance. The other, a montage of hope.Donald Trump’s 2016 primary run was defined by his ruthless use of Twitter and an instinct for spectacle that shattered political convention.He bulldozed a crowded Republican field—mocking Jeb Bush as “low energy,” ridiculing Marco Rubio as a “choke artist,” and branding Ted Cruz “Lyin’ Ted”—turning insults into headlines and tweets into strategy. While others played by the rules, Trump made up his own, bypassing traditional media and speaking directly to millions through his feed. He transformed debates into made-for-TV brawls and campaign rallies into stadium-sized performances, reducing policy to punchlines and elevating politics into a daily, chaotic spectacle.The son of postcolonial theorist Mahmood Mamdani and legendary filmmaker Mira Nair, Zohran Mamdani was born in Uganda, raised in New York, and trained in Astoria’s political trenches. As a democratic socialist assemblyman, he made his name on housing justice, transit reform, and progressive causes.But it wasn’t his platform that won. It was the performance. The myth-making. The energy. He understood what Trump knew early on: politics is entertainment. Elections are theatre. Content is king.Mamdani just gave it a Brooklyn accent and an Instagram filter.Policy? Sure. But Make It Viral.Yes, he has an agenda. A very left one.Rent freeze on stabilised units.200,000 social housing units over 10 years.Fare-free buses, faster trains, fewer cars.Tax hikes on the wealthy and elite universities to fund public childcare and free CUNY tuition.Community safety over policing.LGBTQ+ funding, gender-affirming care, and an Office for Queer Affairs.And on foreign policy? A vocal backer of Palestinian rights, BDS supporter, and critic of Israel’s Gaza policies.But the real success? He didn’t explain all this. He vibed it. Like Trump, who never published a white paper but made you feel something, Mamdani crafted mood more than message. And Gen Z showed up.Andrew Cuomo, former governor and comeback specialist, thought favours and name recognition would carry him. But he was playing by old rules.He brought endorsements. Mamdani brought edits. Cuomo parked his Dodge Charger. Mamdani parachuted in with drone footage. One was running for office. The other was producing a vertical-format revolution.And when it came to the issue of Israel—a potential Achilles heel for Mamdani—he did what Trump would do: deflect, distract, and deliver just enough ambiguity to keep everyone guessing. The Times clutched pearls. The Post clutched its usual megaphone. Mamdani? He uploaded a Reel with the caption: “I’m here to fight for dignity. Everywhere.”3.1 million views. Cuomo’s press release? Zero engagement.Mamdani heads into the general election against Republican Curtis Sliwa, a few independents, and possibly Cuomo if he goes rogue. But the script has already flipped. For decades, New York was ruled by machines—Tammany Hall, Bloomberg’s billions, the Cuomo dynasty. But in 2025, the city’s future belongs to content strategists, not campaign strategists. The new political bosses don’t organise fundraisers. They organise Discord servers.This wasn’t just a primary. It was a generational and ideological rupture. Mamdani’s win is what happens when Trump’s style fuses with left-wing substance. When grievance politics are replaced by aspirational storytelling. When the kids stop waiting for permission and start livestreaming their own revolution.If elected in November, Mamdani wouldn’t just be New York’s first Muslim or Indian-origin mayor. He’d be the first mayor to truly rule from the feed.The Trump era taught us politics was about performance. Mamdani just updated the genre. No red caps. Just red captions. No wall-building. Just storyboarding. And like any great performer, he’s just getting started.","Zohran Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. The 33-year-old channelled the Trump playbook—minus the racism, plus the rent freeze—and turned vibe into victory.

Elon Musk’s Tesla robotaxis face federal investigation after dangerous driving videos go viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/elon-musks-tesla-robotaxis-face-federal-investigation-after-dangerous-driving-videos-go-viral/articleshow/122068791.cms,"Viral clips of Tesla robotaxis trigger regulatory response

Tesla’s rollout collides with public safety concerns

Experts warn of unpredictable AI behavior

Tesla’s regulatory history raises red flags

Musk’s bold ambitions face growing pressure

What’s next for Tesla’s robotaxi program?

In a major setback to Tesla’s self-driving ambitions, federal regulators have launched an investigation into the company’s newly debuted robotaxis following the circulation of alarming videos online. The footage, captured during the early rollout in Austin, Texas, shows Tesla’s autonomous vehicles veering into opposing lanes, ignoring traffic signals, and braking without reason. These incidents have prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to begin an inquiry. Tesla had just begun offering paid robotaxi rides using its updated Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, but the troubling footage now casts doubt on the safety and reliability of the technology.Videos posted on social media show multiple Tesla vehicles behaving erratically. In one case, a robotaxi is seen making an illegal maneuver from a left-turn-only lane, gliding into oncoming traffic before swerving back. Another clip shows a car braking twice in the middle of the road with no obstacles in sight. These viral incidents prompted NHTSA to issue a statement confirming it is in contact with Tesla and reviewing the events.Tesla began offering its first commercial robotaxi rides in Austin using modified Model Y vehicles. The launch was met with enthusiasm from investors and Tesla loyalists, who hailed it as a major milestone. However, safety experts were quick to raise red flags. Critics argue that despite Tesla’s claims, the FSD software still lacks the consistency and judgment required for public road use.Automotive technology specialist Sam Abuelsamid voiced strong concerns over the system’s performance. “This is not a system that should be carrying members of the public,” he said, citing its tendency to alternate between smooth operation and dangerous unpredictability. While some passengers reported flawless rides, experts stress that even rare errors can have catastrophic consequences.The investigation comes amid a history of regulatory clashes between Tesla and the NHTSA. The agency previously forced the company to recall over 2.4 million vehicles due to safety concerns tied to its FSD technology. This new probe raises further questions about Tesla’s readiness to deploy fully autonomous vehicles without a safety driver onboard.CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly promised that Tesla’s robotaxis will revolutionize transportation, even suggesting mass deployment as early as next year. However, with competitors like Waymo already operating safer and more controlled autonomous fleets, Tesla’s margin for error is shrinking. The scrutiny now threatens to slow Tesla’s roadmap and put Musk’s aggressive timelines at risk.While Tesla has yet to release an official statement in response to the investigation, NHTSA's involvement signals increased oversight going forward. If the agency determines that the software poses a serious risk, further recalls or restrictions could follow. For now, the future of Tesla’s autonomous driving program may hinge on whether it can convince regulators—and the public—that its vehicles are truly road-ready.","Videos posted on social media show multiple Tesla vehicles behaving erratically.

Nazi symbols prohibited in Germany



Nazi symbols not banned in the US



Lack of tech company regulation







""Hip-hop visionary, cultural icon and controversial genius YE will perform July 20, 2025 exclusively at the Rubicon Festival in Bratislava. It will be his only confirmed live performance in Europe in 2025 — and ever first show in Slovakia in history,"" organizers confirmed on the event's website on Monday. ""Rubicon Festival is raising the bar for European festivals to a whole new level.""His participation in the festival has sparked anger. More than 3,000 people have already signed a petition asking the festival to cancel the performance of the rapper, who is formerly known as Kanye West.The authors of the petition point out that Ye has in recent years repeatedly and openly adopted the symbolism and ideology associated with Nazi Germany, having written, for example, ""I am a Nazi"" and ""I love Hitler"" on social media platforms.""He trivializes the crimes of the totalitarian dictatorial regime and the war atrocities that also affected the Slovak population,"" the petition reads.The petition refers to Ye's latest track, ""Heil Hitler,"" which was released on May 8 — the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.The song references the Nazi salute which was used while Adolf Hitler was in power. The single's artwork resembles a swastika, and the song ends with a lengthy sample from a Hitler speech.As the petition also mentions, the song is banned in Germany.Within Germany, Ye's video cannot be seen among his posts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Changing one's location to the United States with a VPN makes the post visible.""Heil Hitler"" was used as an official greeting in Nazi Germany. The accompanying arm movement, which is made with the right arm extended and the palm facing down, is said to have its origins in ancient Rome and was then adopted by Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, in the 1920s.Later, Hitler made it a signature of the Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 until 1945.In the postwar era, West German authorities banned the use of many Nazi symbols and gestures as the country emerged from the Holocaust, which claimed millions of victims throughout Europe.The public display or dissemination of Nazi symbols and slogans such as the arm gesture or the phrase became a criminal offense under Section 86a of the German criminal code.This law prohibits the use of symbols associated with ""unconstitutional organizations,"" including those affiliated with the party, such the swastika, SS runes and the Nazi salute and slogans.Using such symbols or gestures can be punished with up to three years in prison or a fine.Denying the Holocaust is also illegal in Germany and many other European countries, as well as in Canada and Israel.Eighty years after the end of the war, the ban on Nazi-related content remains strictTo counter the rise of far-right groups and growing antisemitism, other countries have also banned hate symbols — some quite recently. In February, Australia passed a law against hate crimes that includes minimum sentences for displaying hate symbols, including the Nazi salute.In the United States, many forms of hate speech are protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment, which is meant to guarantee free expression.It is not illegal to perform a Nazi salute or wear a swastika in the United States.Since World War II, the salute has often been used by neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In 2016, for example, a shocking video showed a white supremacist group supporting Donald Trump's 2016 presidential win by raising their arms in an apparent Nazi-style salute.In January, X owner Elon Musk, who openly supports the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, came under scrutiny for performing what looked like a Nazi-style salute at Trump's second inauguration. Musk's defenders claimed it was accidental; many observers saw it as intentional.In response, activists from campaign group Led by Donkeys projected an image on his Tesla factory just outside of Berlin showing Musk doing the gesture, with the title appearing as ""Heil Tesla."" The group felt that if the German authorities considered the symbol to be illegal according to the country's criminal code, it would prove that Musk had performed the Nazi salute.Musk has come under fire for expressing antisemitic views in recent years, including responding to a user on X in 2023 who accused Jewish communities of ""pushing ... dialectical hatred against whites,"" a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists.""You have said the actual truth,"" Musk tweeted in a reply to the user.Though platforms including Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud worked to ban Ye's single quickly after its release because of its antisemitic content, the video was widely available on X. Even though Ye has been suspended multiple times from Twitter and now X for antisemitic content, his account has always been restored.Ye's celebrity status also led fans to share the video on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit, among other platforms, millions of times.It shows just how little power big tech companies seem to have — or want to put into removing offensive content once it has already been published. The video and the scramble to remove it have caused a renewed look at the content policies of major tech companies, particularly the social media platforms owned by Meta.In light of the video, the Anti-Defamation League, a US-based, international nongovernmental organization that combats antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination, started a petition asking Facebook and Instagram to ""reinstate guidelines meant to protect users from disinformation and hate"" on Facebook and Instagram.Meta announced in January that it would no longer employ fact checkers, and loosened rules around hate speech and abuse in light of ""recent elections"" — a reference to Trump's presidential win.Yet the pro-Hitler rhetoric spouted by Ye's latest single still falls under the company's rule of prohibiting ""harmful stereotypes historically linked to intimidation, including Blackface and Holocaust denial.""","More than 3,000 people have already signed a petition asking the festival to cancel the performance of the rapper.

Heat stroke: What to do?

Avoiding heat exhaustion and heat stroke





Sunshine at last! Time to go out to the park or lake and make the most of the nice weather.But at some point, enough is enough and our bodies need a break. If you spend too much time in the sun, you can get heat exhaustion. And those who work hard in the heat can even suffer heat stroke.The terms heat exhaustion and heat stroke are often confused. Rather than two distinct things, you can see them more as two different degrees of severity relating to your body getting hotter. How does it happen and how do you recognize both? Here are some tips for a safe summer.A lot of sun or the extreme temperatures of heat wave scan make your body overheat and lead to heat exhaustion.Heat exhaustion is a heat-related illness, like heat rash, heat cramps or heat stroke. Although less severe than heat stroke, if not properly managed it can lead to the more serious variant.A headache is usually the first sign of heat exhaustion. You are hot, your face is red, you sweat a lot, you move more slowly, and you're likely to experience fatigue, nausea and vomiting. You might also feel dizzy or even faint.What you might not expect: The skin of someone with heat exhaustion is usually not hot, but rather cool.First of all, those suffering from heat exhaustion should immediately be taken out of the sun, to a cool place or into the shade, and drink water as quickly as possible. Cold, damp cloths can help cool the body. In addition, someone with heat exhaustion should drink plenty of fluids to bring hydration levels back to normal. Cold water or sports drinks replenish lost salts, but avoid alcohol and caffeine. These can dehydrate you even more, on top of excessive sweating, which, according to experts, can cause additional fluid loss of up to two liters on very hot days.Until the symptoms get better, you need to rest.It's important to know that in severe cases, severe vomiting, confusion or even unconsciousness can occur. If that happens, you should see a doctor, if only to rule out heat stroke.Heat stroke is more dangerous than heat exhaustion and may occur, for example, when you engage in physical activities in a hot environment or when heat exhaustion is not properly treated.When it's extremely hot outside, the body absorbs more heat than it can release. The body temperature can rise to 41°C (105.8°F) within 10 to 15 minutes. This acute overheating leads to an inflammatory response throughout the body.The body's temperature regulation system fails and sweat production, for example, stops. Sweating is how your body helps cool itself, so without it your body temperature starts rising.Heat stroke is life-threatening. Symptoms include impaired consciousness, headache, dizziness and drowsiness; seizures, vomiting, diarrhea and low blood pressure may also occur. Heat stroke develops within one to six hours and can cause death in less than 24 hours unless properly treated.In the elderly, chronically ill, and children, heat stroke usually occurs because of a combination of high temperatures and severe fluid and electrolyte deficiencies. In healthy adults, too much physical activity in hot sunny weather, such as sports or working outdoors, is what usually causes heat stroke.At the first signs of heat stroke, the emergency services should be alerted immediately. The affected person should be taken out of the sun and heat and into a cool or shady place. Their body should be cooled down as quickly as possible with cold water, ice baths or soaked clothes, and the affected person should be given fluids if possible. Excess clothing should be removed.If unconscious but breathing normally, the person should be placed in a stable horizontal position until emergency personnel arrive. Regular breathing and consciousness must be checked regularly. If the person is not breathing normally, resuscitation efforts must be started.In extremely high temperatures, our body's heat regulation system quickly reaches its limits. In addition, older people often drink too little water. As a result, the body cannot produce enough sweat, which makes it difficult for the body to cool down on its own.In many cases, it is then recommended and safest to call a doctor.The best way to avoid heat exhaustion or even heat stroke is obvious: Don't get too much sun and especially avoid it around midday; protect your head with a light-colored hat; avoid exposure to extreme heat if possible and drink plenty of fluids. As a rule of thumb, an adult needs at least half a liter of water extra on hot days.","A lot of sun or the extreme temperatures of heat wave scan make your body overheat.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

A new study from MIT researchers reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) used for medical treatment recommendations can be swayed by nonclinical factors in patient messages, such as typos, extra spaces, missing gender markers, or informal and dramatic language. These stylistic quirks can lead the models to mistakenly advise patients to self-manage serious health conditions instead of seeking medical care. The inconsistencies caused by nonclinical language become even more pronounced in conversational settings where an LLM interacts with a patient, which is a common use case for patient-facing chatbots.Published ahead of the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, the research shows a 7-9% increase in self-management recommendations when patient messages are altered with such variations. The effect is particularly pronounced for female patients, with models making about 7% more errors and disproportionately advising women to stay home, even when gender cues are absent from the clinical context.“This is strong evidence that models must be audited before use in health care, where they’re already deployed,” said Marzyeh Ghassemi, MIT associate professor and senior author. “LLMs take nonclinical information into account in ways we didn’t previously understand.”Lead author Abinitha Gourabathina, an MIT graduate student, noted that LLMs, often trained on medical exam questions, are used in tasks like assessing clinical severity, where their limitations are less studied. “There’s still so much we don’t know about LLMs,” she said.The study found that colorful language, like slang or dramatic expressions, had the greatest impact on model errors. Unlike LLMs, human clinicians were unaffected by these message variations in follow-up research. “LLMs weren’t designed to prioritize patient care,” Ghassemi added, urging caution in their use for high-stakes medical decisions.The researchers plan to further investigate how LLMs infer gender and design tests to capture vulnerabilities in other patient groups, aiming to improve the reliability of AI in health care.","Large Language Models (LLMs) used for medical treatment recommendations can be swayed by nonclinical factors in patient messages.

From YMCA showers to $300 million exit

Lessons that shaped Elon Musk’s philosophy

Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a costly lesson from his entrepreneurial beginnings this week, revealing how he lost control of his first company Zip2 despite selling it for $300 million in the late 1990s.Speaking to young founders at Y Combinator 's AI Startup School in San Francisco, Musk identified his critical error: ceding too much control to investors who didn't understand the internet. The mistake haunted what should have been a clear victory for the then-unknown entrepreneur.Musk's journey to Zip2 began with rejection. After Stanford University PhD dropout couldn't land a job at Netscape, his resume apparently never reached Marc Andreessen, he decided to build software himself. ""I'm like man, this is ridiculous, so I'll just write software myself and see how it goes,"" Musk recalled.The early days were brutal. Musk and his co-founder slept in their office and showered at the YMCA to save money. In a desperate move to access internet service, Musk even drilled a hole through the office floor to reach the ISP downstairs.Despite the hardships, Zip2 became a success story, ultimately selling for $300 million. However, Musk's willingness to give investors significant control meant he couldn't steer the company according to his vision for the internet's potential.The experience taught Musk to maintain control of his ventures and ""keep the chips on the table."" He invested nearly all of his $20 million from Zip2 into his next company, X .com, which eventually became part of PayPal Now worth $366 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Musk emphasized to the young entrepreneurs that engineering demands truth while politics creates noise—wisdom earned through hard-fought experience in Silicon Valley's early internet days.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a costly lesson from his entrepreneurial beginnings this week.

Claimed responsibility for Air India plane crash

Threatened to blow 21 spots in Ahmedabad alone

How was Rene Joshilda arrested

Acer Swift Neo AI Laptop: Features That Make It Future-Ready!

A 30-year-old robotics engineer from Chennai has been arrested for sending hoax bomb threats across 11 states in an attempt to frame a former colleague who reportedly did not reciprocate her feelings. The accused, Rene Joshlida created multiple fake email IDs, used VPNs and dark webs to stay under the radar for months. As per a police investigation, Joshilda sent fake emails, targeting schools, hospitals, and stadiums in 21 different locations. The techie also sent an email claiming responsibility behind the recent Air India clash in Ahmedabad on June 12 that killed atleast 274. Investigators across states were stumped until a single digital error helped trace the threats back to her.Rene Joshilda is an engineer trained in Robotics. She has been working as a senior consultant at Deloitte in Chennai since 2022. Joshilda met Divij Prabhakar during a project in Bengaluru and fell in love with him. However, the interest was not mutual. Divij did not reciprocate Rene’s feelings and got married to someone else in February this year.Enraged by the rejection, Rene Joshilda allegedly devised an elaborate revenge plan. She created several fake email accounts using variations of Divij Prabhakar’s name and began sending bomb threats to schools, hospitals, and public venues in an attempt to frame him, police investigation said.""When they were working together, she used to create fake email accounts and harass any woman who showed any interest in her secret lover. In one case, she harassed a woman colleague suspecting her to be interested in the male colleague to the extent that she quit her job,"" the police said.The unfortunate Air India plane crash on June 12 killed at least 274 people, including crew members, passengers and civilians on ground. Rene Joshilda, as per police, claimed fake responsibility for the crash. She sent out a hoax email to BJ Medical College administration, saying “I think now you know power. Like we sent you mail yesterday, we crashed the Air India plane with our former CM (Vijay Rupani). We know the police would have thought that the plane crash was a hoax and ignored it. Well done to our pilot. Now you know we are not playing. Now you know.”Using her technical knowledge and expertise, Rene Joshilda used fake email IDs and virtual private networks (VPNs) to send hoax bomb threats. According to Joint CP (Crime) Ahmedabad Sharad Singhal, in the emails – Joshilda threatened to blow up as many as 21 spots in and around Ahmedabad. These included the Narendra Modi stadium in Motera, the Geneva Liberal School in Sarkhej and a civil hospital, among others.Joshilda’s fake bomb threats did not confide to Gujarat alone. As per police, she sent threat emails to 11 states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Bihar, Telangana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana.Police say that Joshilda bought at least 80 numbers through VPN in the past two years and sent hundreds of fake emails. “The number she would use to create email IDs would be virtual. She sent threat emails through Tor browser (a network for anonymous communication) and the Dark Web. She took a lot of precautions. She was very smart and never revealed her digital trail. But she made a small mistake and our cyber crime wing and crime branch tracked her down,” Singhal told the media.She managed to hide her identity and location using the dark web and VPNs, until one time she tipped off her location with a single error. As per an Ahmedabad Mirror report, Joshilda logged into her real and fake email accounts from the same device on one occasion. This helped police in tracing her IP address. ""That one careless login gave her away,"" a police officer said.","Rene Joshilda, 30, is an engineer trained in Robotics.

Anthropic wins AI training ruling but must answer for book theft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropic-wins-ai-training-ruling-but-must-answer-for-book-theft/articleshow/122070158.cms,"The court separated how AI companies use books from how they obtain them

Court's ruling could influence similar lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta

A federal judge ruled that Anthropic 's use of copyrighted books to train its Claude chatbot constitutes fair use under copyright law, delivering a significant victory for the AI industry while ordering the company to face trial over acquiring pirated materials.US District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco determined that training AI models on copyrighted works was ""quintessentially transformative"" and legally justified. The ruling dismissed key copyright infringement claims brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who sued Anthropic last year alleging ""large-scale theft"" of their works.Alsup's decision hinged on the transformative nature of AI training, comparing it to ""any reader aspiring to be a writer"" who learns from existing works to create something entirely different. The judge emphasized that Anthropic's large language models didn't reproduce the authors' creative elements or identifiable writing styles, making the training process legally permissible under fair use doctrine.However, the company isn't completely off the hook. Alsup ordered Anthropic to face a December trial over allegations that it illegally downloaded millions of books from online ""shadow libraries"" of pirated copies. Court documents revealed internal employee concerns about using pirate sites before the company shifted strategies.Anthropic later hired former Google Books executive Tom Turvey and began purchasing books in bulk, physically scanning them for AI training. But the judge noted that buying legitimate copies after initially using pirated versions won't absolve the company of potential liability for the earlier theft, though it may reduce statutory damages.The decision establishes important legal boundaries as AI companies face mounting copyright challenges, potentially setting precedent for similar cases against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Meta.","US District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco determined that training AI models on copyrighted works was ""quintessentially transformative"" The ruling dismissed key copyright infringement claims brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson.

Poll What do you think is the biggest factor behind India's rising influence in global sports? Digital innovation and technology Growing consumption-driven economy

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Speaking at the APOS Fireside Chat in Bali, Sanjog Gupta, CEO - Sports & Live Experiences at JioStar, painted a compelling picture of India's rising global influence in sports, driven by an expanding digital economy and consumer-centric innovation. Gupta's remarks coincided with the release of IPL 2025: A Year of Firsts, a report that underscores the tournament’s unprecedented scale, engagement, and monetisation.“India's growing influence in sport is nothing but a reflection of India's growing significance on the global stage, driven by a strong consumption-oriented economy,” Gupta stated, positioning JioStar’s work at the heart of this evolution.He revealed that IPL 2025 became the most monetised sporting event in Indian history, reaching 1.19 billion viewers across TV and digital platforms, and achieving historic peaks in ad revenue, subscription growth, and platform innovation.According to Gupta, JioStar’s hybrid subscription model and personalised, accessible user journeys played a key role: “Our mission wasn't to incrementally change the landscape—it was to completely shift how consumers perceive paying for content. Much like retail, we allow viewers to experience content freely, and then choose deeper engagement.”He emphasised that JioStar has invested over $500 million, beyond media rights, into technology, production, and marketing to grow the sports ecosystem in India, further noting the 3.5x viewership growth of the English Premier League on their platforms, and their long-term vision for kabaddi as a year-round, mainstream sport.With features like AI-generated highlights, VR streaming, voice search, MaxView 3.0, and inclusive additions like Indian Sign Language interpretation and audio descriptive commentary, IPL 2025 was reimagined for every screen, device, and fan.“Live sports activate all four pillars of the digital media economy—attention, passion, affiliation, and action,” Gupta said. “IPL 2025 wasn't just about numbers—it was about meaningful, emotional moments that moved millions.”As India’s media ecosystem evolves, JioStar’s innovations offer a blueprint for the future, where sports, entertainment, and technology blend into unforgettable, personalised experiences for fans and brands alike.","Sanjog Gupta, CEO - Sports & Live Experiences at JioStar, painted a compelling picture of India's rising global influence in sports.

Jason Kelce’s hilarious strip-down to his underwear for charity (Image via x)

Jason Kelce knows how to throw a party—and how to make an entrance that no one will forget. The former Philadelphia Eagles center turned heads and dropped jaws on Wednesday night during his annual celebrity bartending event in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, all in the name of a good cause.This year, the seven-time Pro Bowler took the stage at his “Team 62” Ocean Drive charity event not just to mix drinks but to shake up the crowd. And shake things up he did—by dramatically ripping off his American flag shorts to reveal nothing but a red, white, and blue speedo underneath. The bold display instantly electrified the room as fans erupted into cheers and laughter.“We have no words…” the official Eagles account posted on X, summing up what most viewers were likely thinking.Kelce, 37, didn’t stop there. He completed the look with a too-short Eagles tank top and the classic white New Balance sneakers, embodying dad-bod confidence like only he can. The moment was instantly viral—funny, wild, and perfectly on-brand for the ever-charismatic former NFL star.The annual event, which Kelce has hosted for five consecutive years, is dedicated to raising funds for the Eagles Autism Foundation.Known for its mix of celebrity cameos and outlandish antics, it’s grown into one of the summer’s most talked-about charity gatherings. Back in 2023, Kelce even competed in a beer-chugging contest, downing 30 ounces in under six seconds—a feat that still lives in Sea Isle City lore.While Travis Kelce was noticeably absent—currently at Tight End University in Nashville—fans hardly missed the younger Kelce sibling. As one fan joked, “One pair of Kelce thighs certainly seems to be enough.”Of course, Jason’s viral moment also drew a wave of thirsty comments online.While a fan with user name @TheMetsX said this act as ""Inappropriate"", another fan @E_TheCowboysFan said,""Buddy retired and became an absolute joke. Needs rehab."" A third user @btclfgmen commented, ""What a fucking tool.. on brand for that loser family."" Meanwhile, one user named @commanders_365 did not hesitate to say, ""Dude just craves attention. ""But his wife, Kylie Kelce, wasn’t having it. On her June 19 episode of the Not Gonna Lie podcast, she responded sharply:“They’re f***ing around because they’re saying things like how fine my husband is or that, like, they would like a piece… I’mma need you to sit down. Put your tongues back in your mouth and be respectful.”Despite her warnings, Jason’s cheeky confidence makes it tough for fans to behave. With his tank tops, dad sneakers, and total lack of shame, Kelce has unofficially claimed the title of America’s most lovable ex-lineman—and his charity events keep proving it, one wild reveal at a time.Also Read: George Kittle finally reveals his honest opinion about Taylor Swift's surprise performance at Travis Kelce’s Tight End University","Former Philadelphia Eagles center turned heads and dropped jaws on Wednesday night during his annual celebrity bartending event in Sea Isle City, New Jersey.
