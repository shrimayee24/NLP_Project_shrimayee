He has achieved remarkable statistical records, including seven Super Bowl wins, 10 Super Bowl appearances, and numerous career milestones such as 89,214 passing yards and 649 touchdowns.Brady's success in the Super Bowl is unparalleled.He has won seven Super Bowls, the most by any player in NFL history, with six victories as a New England Patriot and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. No other player has more than five Super Bowl wins.Additionally, Brady has played in 10 Super Bowls, more than any other quarterback , and earned the MVP award five times, the most in history.Brady's regular season statistics further underscore his dominance. He holds the all-time record for passing yards with 89,214 yards and ranks first in career passing touchdowns with 649.As a starting quarterback, Brady has the most career wins with 251 regular-season victories. He was selected to the Pro Bowl 15 times, tying the record for most Pro Bowl selections by any player.Brady's postseason achievements are equally impressive. He has 35 postseason wins, more than any other quarterback in NFL history. In terms of yardage, Brady holds the record for most postseason passing yards with 13,400 yards. His 88 postseason touchdowns are also an NFL record.Brady has shown remarkable longevity and consistency throughout his career. He started for 21 seasons and played at a high level throughout, winning his last Super Bowl at age 43.

He was also the first NFL quarterback to surpass 600 career passing touchdowns during the 2021 season.When compared to other legendary quarterbacks, Brady's achievements stand out. Joe Montana , for example, went 4-0 in Super Bowls, but Brady's seven titles and 10 appearances place him in a unique category.Peyton Manning , a five-time MVP, won ""only"" two Super Bowls, which pales in comparison to Brady's seven.No other quarterback has achieved as much success over such a long period, making Brady's claim to the GOAT title difficult to dispute.","Brady holds the all-time record for passing yards with 89,214 yards and ranks first in career passing touchdowns with 649.

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines. Tragically, hundreds of people fall victim to these formidable predators each year.Although Henry holds the title of the oldest crocodile, Cassius, a 16-foot saltwater crocodile from Australia, is known as the largest. Captured in 1984, Cassius is a prominent feature at the Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat on Green Island, off the coast of Queensland. In 2011, he was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world’s largest living saltwater crocodile.","Henry was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn’t see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry’s memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry’s depiction of Kate Middleton’s supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

Cosplay: Fantasy meets reality: Why Chinese women are hiring female cosplayers to play dream men,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/fantasy-meets-reality-why-chinese-women-are-hiring-female-cosplayers-to-play-dream-men/articleshow/113095221.cms,"Bringing dream man to reality



Day out in the city



A new kind of relationship



Raising the bar



Emotional satisfaction in a new era



In the final years of high school, Xu Yunting, a Chinese teenager, stumbled upon an unusual side gig—transforming herself into male video game characters and taking their female fans on dates. What started as a way to make pocket money became part of a burgeoning trend in China, known as "" cos commissioning "".This unique job has taken off in China, with many young women using their purchasing power to transform digital fantasies into real-world experiences.The trend has sparked massive interest online, where social media platforms are buzzing with posts about cos commissioning.The concept? Fans of romance games hire female cosplayers to become their favorite male characters and accompany them on dates, creating a fusion of virtual fantasy and reality.Xu Yunting has perfected the art of embodying male characters from popular romance games. One of her most-requested roles is ""Jesse,"" a sensitive musician from ' Light and Night ,' a mobile game produced by tech giant Tencent that allows players to fall in love with various fictional men.Feng Xinyu, a lively 19-year-old, is one of Xu’s regular clients. For Feng, real-life men—whom she refers to as ""3D men""—don’t hold the same appeal as the perfect, fictional characters she encounters in games.“I’m just not interested in dating real guys,” Feng explains. “Game characters are more idealised and fulfilling to me.”'Light and Night' has become a favorite for young women like Feng. It promises a deeply immersive love experience, allowing players to develop emotional connections with their virtual suitors. Players like Feng, who identify as ""dream girls,"" often form intense emotional attachments to the game’s characters. Cos commissioning takes this to another level, bringing these 2D beaus into the real world.Feng has hired Xu three times now to play Jesse, each time paying roughly $70. However, Feng recently splurged on a much more expensive trip with another Jesse cosplayer, spending $2,800 for a multi-day experience. In the end, though, she decided that Xu captured the essence of Jesse better and returned to her for another date.“She’s just like the character,” Feng said to the AFP team. ""It feels like we were meant to be together.""Feng greeted Xu with delight when they met at the metro station. The two held hands and chatted happily as they embarked on their date, which Feng had meticulously planned and paid for.Starting with a relaxing tea break to an indulging hotpot dinner. Their date also included a doll-painting workshop and a cake-decorating class—activities where they were just one of many cos commission pairs.Businesses have taken notice of the trend. Employees at the cake-decorating class shared that they now regularly see cos commission couples. What began as a niche phenomenon is rapidly becoming mainstream.Experts suggest that cos commissioning isn’t just about fantasy—it’s about control and empowerment. The women paying for these experiences get to design their ideal relationship, free from the uncertainties and frustrations of dating real men. They also feel safer and more understood in these interactions, especially since many of the cosplayers, like Xu, are women themselves.“In these interactions, it doesn’t matter what gender the cosplayer is,” says Tian Qian, a professor at Fudan University. “What matters is that the cosplayer becomes a vessel for the client’s emotions, bringing their fantasy to life.”For many young women, the appeal of these interactions lies in their ability to construct an idealized, heteronormative relationship. Conservative social norms around gender roles still dominate Chinese society, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.Zhou Zixing, another academic, has observed that cos commissioning gives women an opportunity to experience relationships on their own terms, where their desires are prioritized.Xu, who enjoys bringing fictional characters to life, believes the experience of dating game characters can positively influence her clients’ expectations of real-life partners.""The men in these games are high-quality,"" Xu explained. ""By experiencing this kind of relationship, I think women can raise their standards in real life and avoid settling for less.""Xu’s mother, Fang Xiuqing, initially struggled to understand her daughter’s work. ""At first, I couldn’t believe this was something my daughter would do,"" Fang admitted. But over time, she has come to see cos commissioning as a harmless and enjoyable activity that brings joy to others.“It’s a hobby more than a job,” Fang said. “She’s happy doing it, and she makes other people happy too.”As the cos commissioning trend grows, it offers more than just a paid service—it provides emotional satisfaction for those who engage in it. Fudan University’s Tian Qian describes it as “emotional sustenance,” saying that even though the interaction is transactional, it still gives clients a sense of being cared for and seen.In a society where traditional dating norms can feel limiting, cos commissioning offers a creative and controlled way for women to engage in romance. For many, it’s not just about meeting their dream game character—it’s about constructing a relationship that caters to their needs, desires, and fantasies in ways real-world relationships often can’t.As this phenomenon continues to expand, it challenges conventional ideas of love and companionship, offering a glimpse into the evolving ways in which people form connections in the digital age.","'Cos commissioning' is a growing trend in China.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Rise in Canva Teams plan prices in some markets



What the company said



Canva recently announced major price hikes for Canva Teams customers. Some markets, like the US, saw team plan prices increase by up to 300%. The popular design platform has claimed that the cost of generative AI is a contributing factor to this price hike . However, some users have criticised the hike to be excessive. Here are the new prices of Canva Teams plans in some markets.In a post on social media platform X, a user named Will Sanders shared the new prices and wrote: “Canva price increase is one of the biggest increases I have ever seen YoY.”In the US, the annual cost for a Canva Teams plan for five users has increased by nearly 316% from $119.99 to $500 (with a 40% discount for the first year).This discount will also apply to new members that will be added in that period.Meanwhile, in Australia, the company increased monthly fees for five-member plans which used to cost 39.99 AUD to $13.50 AUS per user, which is almost a 70% increase (considering getting the plan for five members from the previous price. It's important to note the plan now charges $13.50 per user per month, with a three-user minimum.Canva Teams plans now cost $100 per person annually or $10 monthly and at least three users are required for a Teams plan. These new rates, previously introduced for new customers, are now being applied to existing subscribers with older pricing plans. However, these changes will not affect Canva’s Pro or Enterprise tiers.In a statement to TechCrunch, a Canva spokesperson confirmed the recent price increases and attributed them to the company's growing suite of generative AI tools, such as Magic Studio .“Our original pricing reflected the early stage of this product and has remained unchanged for the last four years. We’re now updating the price for customers on this older plan to reflect our expanded product experience,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson noted that some Canva customers were benefiting from lower pricing plans that are no longer available. Its also important to note that Canva adjusted its Teams pricing to $10 per month per user earlier this year.","Canva recently announced major price hikes for Canva Teams customers.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.
