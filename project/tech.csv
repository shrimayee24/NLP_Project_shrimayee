Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Valluvar, in his timeless brevity, rarely defines wealth virtue, education or honour. His genius lies in resisting rigid definitions, knowing that time may also dissolve what it defines. Yet when it comes to conduct, he commands.This couplet, recited in every Tamil classroom, does not describe(propriety), but insists on it. A man without conduct, he says, does not merely lose face—he tumbles into a disgrace so deep; no praise or privilege can pull him out.Centuries later, in the dazzling chaos of a Coldplay concert, we saw how quick a fall can be.Andy Byron, CEO of Astronomer, and Kristin Cabot, the company’s HR head, were caught on a kiss cam—sixteen seconds of intimacy, followed by awkward attempts to dodge the spotlight. Kristin turns her face away, Andy ducks awkwardly.But the world had already seen them.Chris Martin of Coldplay, unaware of the stakes, quipped, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” By the time the music ended, the footage had gone viral—not because it showed two anonymous lovers, but because both were married.The fallout was swift. Andy resigned and Kristin was placed on indefinite leave. Andy’s wife dropped his surname. Two families unravelled. The company reeled. One hug—perhaps careless—brought down reputations, disrupted careers, and scorched the moral standing of those expected to uphold company values.Too often, heroes fall, not because the world watches, but because they stop watching themselves. Power creates a dangerous illusion—that authority grants exemption from the very rules one promotes. Fame seduces. Influence dulls the inner compass. The higher the pedestal, the greater the fall—especially when leaders forget that respect is earned not by speeches, but by silent choices.Leadership without integrity is mere performance. In an age of billion-dollar companies and fast-moving technology,. Especially those made in the quiet moments where no audience claps.Byron’s story now joins the long list of fallen icons. Not because he erred, but because he mistook position for permission.I am reminded of the Tamil film, one of K Balachander’s finest. In the film, JKB, a married man and a celebrated singer, has an affair with Sindhu, his admirer. After much turmoil and soul-searching, his family agrees to a second marriage. But Sindhu walks away. Her reason — she does not want to become the precedent for moral compromise. If a great artist like JKB bends the code of public probity, she fears others will use him as a license to do the same.She chooses obscurity over validation.The film’s climax, like Valluvar’s couplet, is a mediation on the burden of those in the public eye. Fame, power, and influence are not shields—they are mirrors that magnify every flaw.When conduct fails, greatness does not fall with drama—it crumbles in disgrace. And no amount of apology, wealth, or digital spin can rebuild what the soul has forsaken.From the sands of two millennia, Valluvar’s voice still rises:It is not brilliance, success, or charm that makes a person noble.It is—the unseen thread of morality that holds everything together.Once that thread breaks, everything else unravels. Even ‘all the king’s horses and all the king’s men’cannot put it back together again.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122886781,imgsize-56844,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/122886781.jpg"

Aaron Rodgers debuts Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II helmet after NFL bans his old gear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-debuts-schutt-air-xp-pro-vtd-ii-helmet-after-nfl-bans-his-old-gear/articleshow/122911843.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why Aaron Rodgers’ new helmet still falls in the NFL’s yellow safety category

Aaron Rodgers criticizes new helmet after two decades with Schutt

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has arrived at the training camp field donning a new piece of gear: the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II helmet, equipped with a custom F7 pro facemask. This marks a significant transition for the All-Pro player, who had to abandon his former helmet after the NFL banned it prior to the 2025 season. The information was first revealed through a post from @_MLFootball on X, which announced, ""NEWS: #Steelers All-Pro quarterback Aaron Rodgers is using a new helmet this season."",Aaron Rodgers has switched to a new helmet, the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II, which combines a sense of familiarity with compliance to NFL regulations. It features a custom F7 pro facemask, crafted to mirror elements of his previous gear while still meeting the league's safety standards. NFL insider Mike Garafolo pointed out this change on X, explaining that Rodgers opted for this helmet after trying out several others, as it’s ""closer in design to his old one. "" Although it’s not listed among the NFL’s top-recommended helmets, it is categorized as ""yellow,"" meaning it’s ""not recommended but allowed""; this legal option lets Rodgers keep some comfort while playing.The switch wasn’t a personal decision. Rodgers’ old helmet, the Schutt Air XP Q11, was one of seven models that the NFL banned this offseason. Each year, the league, in collaboration with the NFL Players Association, carries out a helmet performance and safety study to assess equipment based on lab tests and concussion statistics.Helmets that don’t meet the new safety standards are gradually removed, going from 'not recommended' to 'prohibited.' The Schutt Air XP Q11, which was allowed in the past despite mediocre ratings, didn’t pass the safety tests this year.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that he's not happy. At a press conference during the Steelers' minicamp, he expressed his frustrations to the reporters, stating, ""I can’t stand the [new] helmet. I’ve worn a Schutt for 20 years and somehow it finally didn’t pass the safety standards"".His journey to the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II wasn’t straightforward, he first tested the Schutt F7 Pro, a highly rated model, but found it lacking. “I can’t stand the helmet,” he talked again about the F7 Pro before transitioning to the Air XP Pro VTD II during training camp. While it's not the best option, it gives him a vibe similar to his old Q11, blending familiarity with adaptability.Also Read: Justin Jefferson sends bold message to J.J. McCarthy before their first snap together in Minnesota Vikings With training camp going strong and the 2025 season about to kick off in September, Rodgers has the chance to break in his new Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II. He’s decided on it for the moment, but his initial concerns hint that he may need some time to adapt.","Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has switched to a new helmet.

The Incognito Dolphin cosmetic bundle for Jeff the Land Shark first made its way into Marvel Rivals in December 2024 in Season 0 of the game. This Epic skin became an instant hit after its release and the discounted price of 1,400 lattice added fuel to the anticipation.However, many players started playing the game after Season 0, so most of them missed out on this adorable outfit and the other cosmetics within the bundle. That is why, this highly wanted bundle is back again for players to collect, but there is a catch.Marvel Rivals has recently launched the Incognito Dolphin cosmetic bundle for Jeff the Land Shark yet again, and the most exciting part about it is that fans can get this bundle for absolutely free. But the catch is that only the PlayStation users having an active PS Plus subscription can get this for free.The Incognito Dolphin bundle comes with a costume for Jeff the Land Shark along with an MVP animation, a Spray, a Nameplate, and 300 Chrono Tokens. Now the question is, how can PS Plus members redeem this bundle? This process is quite simple. All they have to do is to make sure that their PlayStation account is connected to Marvel Rivals.And then they need to head on to the PlayStation Store and search for the “Marvel Rivals - 2025 Q3 bundle” from their PS5 console itself or through the online store.After opening that page, players need to hit the “Add to Cart” option, and at last continue with the “Confirm Purchase” option. As long as an active PS Plus account is connected to the store, the price of this bundle will be shown as $0.00. So, it will be an absolutely free bundle for the PS Plus users. After completing the purchase, the bundle will automatically reflect in the associated Marvel Rivals account in the game.As of now, there is no expiration date of this bundle mentioned in the PlayStation Store. But players should make this transaction as early as possible, because this free deal might be replaced by the Q4 bundle in near future.Non-PS Plus members shouldn’t get disappointed because they can also get another freebie, irrespective of any PS Plus subscription, in the form of the Scarlet Spider costume for Spider-Man, which they can redeem by following the same aforementioned process. However, the PlayStation account needs to be connected with Marvel Rivals as it’s a PS-exclusive skin.However, players from different platforms might get really disappointed because none of these free rewards are available in the in-game store to buy through Lattice or in-game credits.","The Incognito Dolphin cosmetic bundle for Jeff the Land Shark first made its way into Marvel Rivals in December 2024 in Season 0 of the game.

"Who is Kashish Mittal? From IAS to Microsoft to AI to classical singing, the man going viral for his lyrics and LinkedIn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-kashish-mittal-from-ias-to-microsoft-to-ai-to-classical-singing-the-man-going-viral-for-his-lyrics-and-linkedin/articleshow/122899560.cms,"Kashish Mittal’s early achievements and civil services career

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery. The post was later reshared by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for tooLong.

Poll Do you believe social media plays a significant role in promoting educational achievements? Yes, definitely! Not really, it’s mostly for entertainment.





A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years.

If you're new to the UAE, whether as a resident or visitor, and plan to drive, it's vital to understand the country's Black Points System, which is central to how traffic violations are handled. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system is a powerful tool for promoting road safety by penalizing unsafe driving behaviors. It applies across all emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and is a key part of the UAE Vision 2021 for reducing road accidents and fatalities.Violations are tracked using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems, and black points are added to your driving license for each offense. Once a violation is confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours, detailing the offense, fine, and black points imposed.The system is designed not just to fine violators, but to accumulate penalties, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining, especially for repeat offenders or those involved in serious infractions.In both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the system works on a 24-point scale:Suspension periods:To monitor your point status:Violations in the UAE are grouped by how dangerous they are, with penalties combining black points, fines, and sometimes additional sanctions such as court decisions or vehicle impoundment.These are major offenses that pose a serious risk to public safety and often carryThese infractions significantly raise accident risks and are often committed unintentionally:These are common infractions but can add up quickly for careless drivers:If you're worried about racking up black points, Dubai Police offers a training program for drivers with between 8 and 23 black points.

Q: What should I wear in public areas?





Qatar is becoming a popular destination for travelers worldwide. With its stunning architecture, luxury malls, and rich culture, Qatar offers plenty to see and do. But before you travel to Qatar, it’s important to know that it’s a conservative country with strict rules. These rules might not be obvious to visitors but can lead to fines or even jail time.Unlike many countries, Qatar’s laws are based on its cultural and religious values combined with a modern outlook. What you wear, how you behave, and what you bring all matter here. To have a smooth trip to Qatar, knowing these key travel tips can save you from trouble.In Qatar, modesty isn’t just polite, it’s the law. Both men and women should cover their shoulders and knees in public spaces. This means men should avoid shorts, and women should choose dresses that aren’t too short.

Sanjai Syamaprasad, a 48-year-old Indian-origin hospital worker in Long Island, pleaded guilty to having filmed as many as 13,000 patients and staff in the restrooms by placing secret camera disguised as a smoke detector. But despite his heinous crime, he was not given jail time as he pleaded guilty.Sanjai Syamaprasad, a Brooklyn father and a former sleep tech who used to work at sleep disorder facilities, will only get five years of probation. His original plea was not guilty on five counts of unlawful surveillance and two counts of tampering with evidence, but he changed his plea.He was caught watching bathroom footage on his phone at work by his coworkers and was then fired by Northwell Sleep Disorders last year.Prosecutors seized more than 300 videos that recorded body parts of hundreds of people, but based on who they could identify, they were only able to bring charges involving five victims, including a child, CBS News reported.Sanjai installed velcro dots in nine bathrooms and used the dots to position the spy camera where it could record the shower and toilet.Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly had recommended one to three years behind bars for each count.“My reaction to five years probation is disappointment and disgust — this case deserved jail time,” she said. “What he did, the number of people he exposed — over 300 plus videos we have — and you treat that with probation?

The Midday Work Ban

How Police Efforts Help Workers in the Heat





As the UAE faces scorching summer temperatures reaching nearly 45ºC, outdoor workers are at higher risk of heat-related illnesses. To help, UAE police have launched several initiatives to support laborers during this extreme heat season. From distributing free ice creams, cold drinks, and laban to handing out umbrellas, the police are taking practical steps to keep workers cool and safe.These efforts align with government measures like the midday work ban, designed to protect outdoor laborers from the hottest hours. This summer, the UAE is focused on worker safety and wellbeing in the face of intense heat.In Ajman, police officers have been distributing cold water, laban (a yogurt drink), juice, and small cups of ice cream to laborers and passersby. This simple act provides immediate comfort and relief from the heat. The initiative is part of an ongoing effort, building on last year’s campaign called ‘We Come to You, Our Summer is Cool,’ where officers visited various labor sites to support workers.In Dubai, a similar program called the ‘shade and reward’ initiative provided 300 laborers with free umbrellas. This effort took place at Al Eyas Police Point and aimed to protect workers from direct sunlight during work hours.Besides the umbrellas, authorities shared practical advice about staying hydrated, preventing heatstroke, and highlighted workers’ legal rights and available services.The UAE police have been supporting outdoor workers during summer for several years. In 2023, the ‘We Come to You, Our Summer is Cool’ campaign saw officers visiting multiple labor sites to hand out cold water, juices, and other refreshments. This helped thousands of workers stay hydrated and comfortable despite the harsh weather.In Dubai, the General Department of Human Rights at Dubai Police launched the Soqia initiative, which provided cold water and juice to over 600 workers. These ongoing efforts focus on promoting kindness and community spirit while protecting workers from heat-related illnesses.Preventing heat stress is crucial in the UAE’s extreme climate, so managing hydration, rest, and body temperature is essential to protect outdoor workers.The UAE enforces a midday work ban from June 15 to September 15. Outdoor labor is prohibited between 12:30pm and 3pm, the hottest part of the day. This policy, now in its 21st year, aims to reduce heat stress risks for workers exposed to direct sunlight. It’s a crucial step in protecting health and preventing heat-related illnesses.Police distribution of cold refreshments and umbrellas may seem small, but these gestures have real benefits. Staying hydrated and protected from the sun reduces the risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Simple acts like handing out ice cream or cold drinks provide immediate relief and show care for the wellbeing of outdoor workers. The police’s message goes beyond just handing out items, they encourage workers to stay safe, rest when needed, and protect themselves from the harsh midday sun.People can also join in by volunteering to hand out cold drinks and ice cream through the Al Freej Fridge project. It’s a community-driven effort to keep laborers cool during the harsh summer months.","UAE police distribute cold drinks, ice cream, and umbrellas to workers during extreme heat.

Almost overnight, a large, heart-shaped lake had appeared in the middle of the desert, complete with walking trails, rest zones, and desert landscaping. People rushed to find it, visit it, and photograph it. And it hasn’t slowed down since.Dubai’s leaders didn’t just create Love Lake, they’ve also been personally connected to it.In 2018, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (Vice President and Ruler of Dubai) and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed (now UAE President) brought the King of Bahrain to visit Love Lake. It was a quiet but symbolic gesture, a way to show what Dubai stands for beyond skyscrapers and malls.Then in 2019, Love Lake became the setting for a surprise wedding.

TL;DR

UAE banks will stop using SMS and email OTPs for online and money transfer verifications

In-app authentication will be the new standard for confirming transactions

The shift begins July 25, 2025, with full rollout required by March 31, 2026

Why Is This Happening?

The Financial Threat

According to the UAE Cybersecurity Council, public sector entities face and block over 50,000 attacks daily.

As per UAE's cybersecurity officials, ransomware attacks increased by 32% in 2024.

Ransomware incidents in the UAE rose from 27 in 2023 to 34 in Jan–Nov 2024, reported by Acronis.

OTPs Are No Longer Safe

OTPs sent by SMS or email can be hijacked through phishing, SIM-swapping, or malware

Many users unknowingly hand over codes to scammers

Once stolen, attackers can quickly empty accounts or transfer money abroad

What Will Change for You?



Transactions will need in-app confirmation

When you make a payment, your bank app will ask you to approve or reject it

You must have the app installed and notifications turned on

This adds a real-time layer of security





What Banks Want Customers to Know

FAQ

1. Will SMS OTPs still work for now?

2. What happens if I lose my phone?

3. What if I don’t want to use a mobile app?





Starting Friday, July 25, 2025, banks in the UAE will begin moving away from one-time passwords (OTPs) sent via SMS or email, according to a report by Emarat Al Youm, a local news outlet. Instead, customers will need to use their bank’s mobile app to approve or reject digital transactions, both local and international.This change is being rolled out gradually across banks, and it comes from a directive issued by the Central Bank of the UAE. The final deadline for full implementation is March 31, 2026. By then, all banks must stop using SMS and email for transaction authentication.The switch is designed to improve security and reduce the risk of fraud, especially as cyberattacks on banks continue to rise. From phishing and SIM-swapping to ransomware, traditional OTP methods have become too easy for attackers to exploit.According to Emarat Al Youm, an official document circulated to banks said:“Based on instructions from the Central Bank of the UAE, please note that the receipt of one-time passwords via text messages or email will be gradually phased out. Customers can now complete electronic transactions with ease via the smart application by selecting the ‘authentication via mobile application’ feature.”OTPs will be phased out and you’ll no longer get one-time codes via SMS or email. Instead, you’ll get a push notification from your bank’s appBank officials say this is a better way to protect both users and systems. In quotes published by Emarat Al Youm, one official explained that the mobile app method lets the customer directly authorize or reject transactions, making it harder for fraud to succeed.This approach also means less reliance on networks that can be intercepted or spoofed. It adds a layer of active consent from the customer, instead of passive code entry.Yes, during the transition period. But expect them to disappear by March 2026.Notify your bank immediately.

"Perseid Meteor Shower in UAE: When and where to watch, full details inside",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/perseid-meteor-shower-in-uae-when-and-where-to-watch-full-details-inside/articleshow/122858857.cms,"Perseid meteor shower lights up UAE skies with best viewing from late July to late August/ Image: Unsplash

TL;DR

The Perseids are active July 17 to August 23, peaking August 12–13, but moonlight may affect visibility.

Best time to watch in the UAE: July 23–24 (new moon) or August 16–26 (post-peak, darker skies).

Top stargazing spots: Al Awir Desert , Hatta, and other low-light desert areas.

What Is the Perseid Meteor Shower?

When to Watch in the UAE



July 23–24 (Best Viewing Conditions): Just after the new moon, so skies will be darkest. You’ll see fewer meteors than at peak, but visibility will be much clearer.

Just after the new moon, so skies will be darkest. You’ll see fewer meteors than at peak, but visibility will be much clearer. August 12–13 (Official Peak): This is when the most meteors will occur (up to 75/hour), but the 84% full moon will wash out many of them. Only the brightest streaks will be visible.

This is when the most meteors will occur (up to 75/hour), but the 84% full moon will wash out many of them. Only the brightest streaks will be visible. August 16–26 (Late Window): After the full moon fades, skies get dark again. Meteor rates drop slightly, but viewing improves. A solid second chance if you miss the peak.

Where to Stargaze in UAE

Al Awir Desert (Dubai): Not too far from the city, but remote enough for dark skies. A popular and easy-to-access stargazing spot.

Hatta (2 hours from Dubai): Mountain air, desert surroundings, and minimal light. Great for overnight trips and casual camping.

Al Quaa Desert (Abu Dhabi): One of the darkest locations in the UAE, and ideal for serious stargazing.

Viewing Tips: How to Get the Most Out of It

Avoid city lights. Head out to a desert or low-light area.

Let your eyes adjust. It takes 20-30 minutes for full night vision.

Skip the gear. No telescope needed, meteors are best seen with your eyes.

Limit phone use. Screens ruin your night vision.

Watch for at least an hour. Meteors often come in clusters, with pauses in between.

Bonus: Milky Way Viewing on July 26

FAQ

1. Do I need a telescope to see the Perseids?

2. Can I watch from my backyard or rooftop?

3. What time is best for meteor watching?





If you live in the UAE and enjoy looking up at the night sky, now’s the time. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the most anticipated night-sky events of the year, has returned. Active from July 17 to August 23, it brings bright streaks of light and fast-moving meteors across the sky, often visible without any equipment.Known for fast, bright meteors, the Perseids can produce up to 100 streaks per hour during peak nights. These ""shooting stars"" come from debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle, and they burn up high in Earth’s atmosphere, putting on a natural light show.This year, the peak falls on August 12–13, but unfortunately, it coincides with a nearly full moon. That means the sky will be brighter than ideal, which could make most of the meteors harder to see. Still, there are other dates with darker skies where you can catch the show, especially in the UAE’s wide open deserts.Each year, Earth passes through a trail of dust left by Comet Swift-Tuttle. That dust hits our atmosphere at high speed (about 60 km/second) and lights up, creating what we call meteors.The shower gets its name from the Perseus constellation, which is the point in the sky where the meteors seem to come from.But you don’t need to find it, just look up anywhere in the sky and be patient.You’ll need to get away from light pollution to see anything clearly. Here are a few recommended places:Additionally, the Dubai Astronomy Group will host a stargazing event on August 12, right during the Perseid peak. The event will include expert guidance, telescope stations, and desert camping vibes. Details are coming soon, check their site or Instagram for updates.If you're into more than just meteors, there’s an extra celestial treat this month. On Saturday, July 26, the Dubai Astronomy Group is hosting a Milky Way gazing event in Al Quaa Desert, Abu Dhabi.This event is all about taking in the full arc of the Milky Way Galaxy, which will be fully visible in the dark desert sky, with no city lights in the way. Whether you’re a seasoned astrophotographer or just want to experience a quiet night under the stars, this is a great chance to connect with the night sky.The Perseids will still be active during this time, so you may even catch a few meteors too.No. Meteors are best seen without any equipment. Just lie back and look up.Only if you're far from city lights. In most urban areas, light pollution will block your view.After midnight is usually the best time, that's when the most meteors are visible.","Perseid meteor shower is one of the most anticipated night-sky events of the year.

"UAE: No visa renewal for Dubai residents without paying traffic fines, what expats need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-no-visa-renewal-for-dubai-residents-without-paying-traffic-fines-what-expats-need-to-know/articleshow/122849381.cms,"Dubai’s new system requires residents to settle all unpaid traffic fines, either fully or via instalments, before completing visa renewals/ Image: Dubai Media Office

TL;DR



Dubai residents must clear all traffic fines before renewing or issuing residency visas, under a new pilot system by GDRFA.



The system is designed to encourage rule-following, not punish, payment in instalments is available via RTA’s Tabby platform.



It’s not fully rolled out yet and currently excludes Dubai Airport’s GDRFA centre.



RTA now allows fines and other fees to be paid digitally across apps, kiosks, and its website with flexible plans.



System Designed with Flexibility and Convenience



Policy Meant to Promote Responsibility, Not Punishment



Not a New Concept, But Now More Digitally Integrated



FAQs:







Q: Do I need to pay all my traffic fines before renewing my Dubai visa?

Q:Can I pay in instalments if my fines are high?

Q: Is this rule applied everywhere in Dubai?

Q: Where can I pay my fines digitally?





Dubai residents must now settle all outstanding traffic fines before renewing or issuing their residency visas, under a newly piloted system launched by Dubai’s immigration and road transport authorities. This initiative is being spearheaded by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) in coordination with the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA).Accoring to reports, the rule has not been rolled out universally across all government touchpoints yet but is actively being trialled at several visa service centres, excluding the GDRFA centre at Dubai Airport. The GDRFA confirmed that the system is still in the pilot phase and is being implemented gradually.This means that any Dubai resident with unpaid traffic fines will be prompted to clear them before they can complete their visa transactions. The goal, according to officials, is not to impose restrictions but to reinforce accountability and encourage lawful conduct among residents. The system has been structured to avoid disruption, allowing payment in full or through instalment plans, depending on the individual's situation.Officials say the system is intended to be fair and manageable. Residents with large pending fines can opt to pay them off in instalments. Flexibility is a key feature of the initiative, which has been developed after extensive internal reviews and the assessment of thousands of individual cases.To make the process smooth and accessible, RTA has upgraded its digital services, integrating Tabby, a payment platform, into all its digital channels. These include the RTA website, RTA app, nol Pay app, and previously installed smart kiosks. Residents can now pay for up to 170 services, including traffic fines, vehicle licence renewals, and driving licence transactions, through Tabby’s instalment system.Tabby enables users to divide their payments into up to four instalments, significantly reducing the financial burden of lump-sum fines. The feature also covers purchases of vehicle number plates, providing added convenience across a wider range of services.Authorities have emphasised that the move is not meant to penalise residents but rather to encourage them to take responsibility for their actions and adhere to local laws. GDRFA leadership underscored that individuals who wish to live and work in Dubai are expected to follow the country’s rules and regulations.Failure to clear dues could lead to complications in the future, including difficulties when trying to exit the country. For example, individuals with fines still pending after several years might face obstacles at the time of departure, potentially being stopped at immigration checkpoints.Residents who visit GDRFA centres for visa-related services will be guided through the traffic fine settlement process. Authorities have ensured that the new approach remains resident-friendly, with the system designed to inform, assist, and offer solutions, not deny services outright.This is not the first time UAE authorities have explored the idea of linking fines with residency services. As far back as 2014, the Ministry of Interior had floated a similar initiative where traffic fines were tied to visa renewal processes.However, the current system differs by providing digital convenience, wider integration, and structured payment options, all supported by RTA’s tech-driven platforms. The enhanced ease of access makes compliance far more manageable today than it may have been in previous years.As the system moves out of its pilot phase, broader implementation is expected in the coming months. Residents are advised to regularly check for any outstanding violations and resolve them early to avoid delays in their visa procedures.Yes, under the new system, you must clear outstanding fines before your visa can be renewed or issued.Yes, you can split payments using Tabby across RTA’s digital platforms.Not yet, it’s in the pilot phase and doesn’t apply at Dubai Airport’s GDRFA centre.You can use the RTA website, app, nol Pay app, or smart kiosks for digital payments.","Dubai’s new system requires residents to settle all unpaid traffic fines, either fully or via instalments, before completing visa renewals.

A 24-year-old surf instructor from California is recovering in hospital after a horrific accident in which her arm was torn off by an Amtrak train while she was pushing her electric bike across railway tracks.Elieah Boyd was struck just before 5:30 pm on 7 July in Ventura, as she attempted to move her 80-pound e-bike over the tracks.“There was no train horn. It was like three seconds from when I saw the train to when it happened,” she told local outlet KTLA.The train only lightly clipped her bike, but with devastating effect, ripping her arm clean off. Incredibly, the severed limb was found several feet away and surgeons were able to reattach it in a complex 10-hour operation at UC Irvine Medical Center.A retired firefighter who had been walking with her at the time quickly called emergency services, likely helping to save her life.Boyd, who still faces at least two more operations, says she has already begun to feel faint pulses of sensation in her arm. “Kind of like jolts of energy is what it feels like. I do have feeling internally that it’s healing,” she said, as quoted by the New York Post.Despite the trauma, the experienced surfer is focused on getting back to the ocean. “As soon as I can touch the water, I’ll be on a surfboard. That’s all I dream about here in the hospital,” she added.A GoFundMe campaign set up to support her recovery has already raised over $50,000 of its $65,000 goal.“Through it all, Elieah has shown incredible strength, keeping her positive spirit and infectious smile,” the page read.","Elieah Boyd, 24, was struck by an Amtrak train as she pushed her e-bike across railway tracks in Ventura, California.

Why risk management matters for F&O traders

In India's dynamic Futures and Options (F&O) markets, managing risk is as important as identifying trading opportunities. For technical traders navigating volatility, protecting capital is crucial to ensuring long-term success. A well-planned risk management strategy helps minimize losses, control emotional decision-making, and maintain consistency—even when markets move unpredictably.While market structures and brokerages, including Angel One, have introduced several mechanisms to promote safer trading environments, individual discipline remains key. Understanding and using the right tools can empower traders to manage exposure effectively without compromising agility.Extreme volatility or low liquidity can sometimes cause unexpected price movements during order execution. To reduce the risk of unfavourable fills, brokers like Angel One have introduced Market Price Protection (MPP). Under this mechanism, instead of sending pure market orders that may execute at any price, the system automatically converts these into limit orders with a price range buffer.This adjustment helps protect traders from significantly worse prices during fast-moving or thinly traded markets, offering better control over trade execution without requiring manual intervention.Stop-loss orders are a fundamental tool in trading, designed to cap potential losses if the market moves against a position. However, not all stop-loss strategies are static. One way traders can better adapt to changing price action is through a Trailing Stop-Loss, now available on Angel One.A trailing stop-loss automatically adjusts the stop level as the market price moves in a trader’s favor. For example, in a long trade, if the price rises, the stop-loss also moves upward, locking in more favourable exit points. This dynamic method can help traders protect accumulated profits or limit losses without needing constant manual adjustments.By automating the movement of stop-loss levels, trailing stops encourage a more disciplined trading approach, removing emotional bias from exit decisions.Another practical risk management feature traders can use is Set Exit, which allows setting both stop-loss and target level from a single interface in the Positions Book. By defining these levels at the start of a trade, traders can stick to their risk-reward plans more easily.The system incorporates an OCO (One Cancels the Other) functionality—meaning that if either the stop-loss or target is triggered, the remaining order is automatically cancelled. This prevents scenarios where traders might forget to manually close the second order, reducing errors and stress during volatile periods.By streamlining the exit planning process, traders can stay focused on strategy execution while reducing manual monitoring.Risk management doesn't stop at individual trades. Traders often have a broader daily plan, setting limits for maximum acceptable loss or desired profit. However, staying disciplined can be difficult in the heat of trading.Angel One offers a Secure Exit feature that helps traders adhere to these plans. Users can set daily target thresholds across their entire portfolio. When the preset threshold is reached——all open positions are automatically squared off.This approach helps eliminate emotional decision-making, protects gains, and prevents bigger losses that could arise from overtrading. It supports a steady, methodical trading discipline aimed at long-term survival and growth in the market.Volatility in the F&O markets presents both opportunity and risk. Without proper safeguards, traders can experience sudden, large losses that are difficult to recover from. Incorporating tools like Market Price Protection, Trailing Stop-Loss, Set Exit, and Secure Exit can help technical traders manage risks at multiple levels—from individual orders to the entire portfolio.By embedding discipline directly into their trading systems, traders can reduce reliance on emotional responses and create a sustainable trading journey.","In India's dynamic Futures and Options (F&O) markets, managing risk is as important as identifying trading opportunities.

Trading in India's F&O markets demands precision, speed, and the ability to react quickly to changing market conditions. To support this, Angel One has introduced a range of web-based tools aimed at helping traders analyze, plan, and execute strategies more effectively — all while maintaining a disciplined approach to trading.Keeping a close eye on key stocks and contracts is now easier. Traders can expand their Watchlist to view detailed information such as Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices, volume, bid-ask spread, and 52-week high/low levels.

The Watchlist can also be sorted, filtered, or divided into custom sections for better organization.Understanding the broader market sentiment is crucial in F&O trading. Under Angel One’s Markets section, users can now easily view changes in FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) and DII (Domestic Institutional Investors) positions across various timelines. This visibility can help traders interpret institutional activity and adjust their strategies accordingly.For options traders, seamless execution is key. Angel One’s web platform allows viewing a compact option chain alongside charts, reducing the need to toggle between multiple windows. A smaller Quick Options List is also available directly from the Watchlist, providing easy access to index option contracts when speed matters most.Serious traders often prefer an uncluttered, focused workspace. Angel One’s TradeOne setup allows users to maximize their screen space by viewing charts, positions, and trading balances all in one window. Traders can place and exit orders directly from charts, edit open orders, and track P&L without switching tabs — creating a smoother, faster trading experience.Trading doesn't end with order execution. Angel One’s platform allows users to revisit their daily, weekly, or monthly performance through the P&L (Profit and Loss) page. Traders can analyze their earnings, charges, and overall trading balance in detail, helping them refine strategies and manage risk more effectively over time.","Trading in India's F&O markets demands precision, speed, and the ability to react quickly to changing market conditions.

Options trading is a dynamic field, requiring not just quick decisions but also carefully crafted strategies to manage risk and maximize opportunities. With the increasing participation in India’s F&O markets, having the resources to plan trades has become essential for traders at all levels.One such approach is using an Options Strategy Builder — a tool designed to help beginner and intermediate F&O traders construct strategies with greater clarity and efficiency. An Options Strategy Builder on Angel One enables users to formulate multi-leg strategies by selecting contracts based on their market view, risk appetite, and target returns.Instead of executing multiple individual option orders separately, traders can combine different contracts in a basket and place them together. Whether it’s an Iron Condor, a Straddle, a Strangle, or other well-known strategies, the builder simplifies the process into a few intuitive steps.Importantly, traders can choose from predefined strategies, build custom strategies, and use strategy analysis tools such as payoff analysis graphs, Greek calculations, and strategy charts to evaluate potential outcomes and refine their approach.Traders can also simulate different market scenarios to visualize how their strategy might perform, helping them make informed decisions before placing trades.This integrated approach saves time, reduces manual errors, and allows for better planning in volatile markets.For those seeking a smoother learning curve while entering the world of strategic options trading, tools like the Options Strategy Builder available on Angel One offer a valuable advantage — making sophisticated trading setups more accessible to everyday traders.","With increasing participation in India’s F&O markets, having the resources to plan trades has become essential for traders at all levels.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
