NEW DELHI: Smoking on board an aircraft, with lavatories being one of the favourite places for this illegal act, could soon get one arrested and also put on the no-fly list. Continuously kicking seat backs/tray tables, tampering with emergency exits, playing with life jackets or on-board protests, too, could invite the same action under the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) proposed regulations to deal with unruly flyers.The duration of being barred from flying can last up to a lifetime, based on the gravity of the offence.The draft rules say that if a passenger indulges in any of the acts specified under four categories of 'unruly behaviour', ""he/she is likely to be breaking the law and could be arrested on arrival at the destination, or at any other airport where the aircraft commander may choose to land"".These clauses include consumption of, or being under the influence of, alcoholic beverages or drugs, resulting in unruly behaviour; smoking or use of electronic smoking devices on board the aircraft; failure to obey the instructions of the pilot-in-command; use of threatening or abusive language towards a crew member or any other passenger; resorting to physical assault, threat or disorderly behaviour; and interfering with or obstructing the performance of the duties of a crew member.Also covered under these cause are actions such as ""engaging in sloganeering/protest; tampering with the aircraft parts or equipment, unauthorised use of life jackets or tampering of doors/emergency exits; and other types of riotous behaviour"".","The duration of being barred from flying can last up to a lifetime, based on the gravity of the offence.

JetBlue sends a reply to Buffalo Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins regarding the alleged theft

Airline theft, losing $100K jewelry mid air

Daiyaana Muhammad was last spotted at 2026 NFL Honors

Dion Dawkins shared a post on X claiming he booked first-class JetBlue tickets for his family to travel from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale, but the airline employees stole his fiancée Daiyaana Muhammad’s jewelry and Rolex watches from her bag.The Buffalo Bills left tackle’s post read: “#JetBlue makes no sense for security. I spent 10k to give my family an experience and put them all on first class @JetBlue Mint from LA to Fort Lauderdale And employees steal my fiances Jewlery out of her bag. Rolex Watches.”JetBlue replied to Dawkins’ post, saying, “Hi, there. We’d like to take a closer look at this with you. Please send us a DM with the reservation information.”The Daily Mail’s Oliver Salt also shared the X post in their story and reached out to JetBlue for comment.The exclusive, high-priced “Mint” class tickets offer privacy, personalized attention, and enhanced protective measures. However, when Dawkins’ fiancée arrived in Florida, she discovered that Rolex watches and several items of jewelry were missing from her luggage.The five-time Pro Bowler’s post received little traction at 65K, but when sports media personality Dov Kleiman shared the news, it quickly gained attention and reached 825K.Over 300 people shared their views, including one who wrote, “This is why people are losing faith in major airlines - spending $10k on a flight just to get robbed is peak 2026.Fun fact: airline theft has spiked recently, but losing multiple Rolexes in Mint class is a whole new level of security failure. @JetBlue, do better and get this man his fiancée's property back before the Shnowman loses his cool entirely.”Another said, “This is absolutely unacceptable. Spending that much for a premium experience only to have your personal belongings stolen is a total nightmare. Hope you get justice!”A third user elaborated, “Imagine dropping $10k to give your family a first-class Mint experience, expecting comfort, privacy, and peace of mind… and instead it turns into a crime scene in the sky. Losing over $100k in jewelry and Rolexes while you’re literally mid-air is wild.At that level, you’re not just paying for a bigger seat, you’re paying for security and a sense that everything around you is handled.For something like this to happen, it just feels like a huge breakdown somewhere. You spend that kind of money to relax, not to land and realize you’ve been robbed at 35,000 feet. That’s the part that really makes it hit.”Muhammad is a Los Angeles native.

Gmc Hummer Ev Lamelo Ball: LaMelo Ball Car Collection: 5 Wild Rides Worth $1.2M,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/top-5-cars-in-lamelo-balls-garage/articleshow/128566859.cms,"LaMelo Ball of the Charlotte Hornets (David Jensen/Getty Images)

1. The Custom 2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1

2. Rolls-Royce Cullinan (Mansory Edition)

3. Ferrari F8 Tributo



4. Lamborghini Urus (Neon Yellow)

5. Lamborghini Gallardo

For the 24-year-old LaMelo Ball, the driveway usually looks a little different than the average commuter's, especially with a $260 million contract. The Charlotte Hornets sensation’s car collection is more than just a fleet of expensive metal, it is an extension of his 1-of-1 brand.Valued at over $1.2 million, the NBA All-Star’s garage is a mix of high-speed Italian engineering and heavy-duty American muscle, almost always finished with a custom flair that ensures he’s never missed on the streets of Uptown Charlotte. So, let’s take a look at these top five standout vehicles in LaMelo’s world-class collection.Perhaps his most famous (and recently infamous) ride is the custom-wrapped GMC Hummer EV. This electric beast was designed as a rolling tribute to his signature Puma MB.01 sneakers. The car features a desert camo 3M wrap with bright orange accents on the rims, with graphics inspired by tattoos, and a glass display case inside for his shoes. While the vehicle made headlines in February 2026 after a minor collision in downtown Charlotte, it remains the ultimate symbol of LaMelo Ball’s multi-million dollar partnership with Puma.For pure luxury, LaMelo turns to his blacked-out Rolls-Royce Cullinan. This isn't just a standard luxury SUV but a heavily modified moving symbol of opulence by Mansory. Ball is known for frequently changing the look of this car, and this car too has changed from matte black to deep purple and, most recently, to a bold dark lava orange. It features a 6.7L twin-turbo V12 under the hood, showcasing the perfect combination of a smooth ride and aggressive street presence.When it’s time for pure speed, LaMelo Ball knows it’s time to drive the Ferrari F8 Tributo. The car can hit 211 mph and sprints from 0 to 60 in under three seconds. The F8 Tributo is a masterpiece of aerodynamics. LaMelo has famously had the car outfitted with a hologram skin that shifts colors depending on the angle of the light, making it one of the most eye-catching Ferraris in the league.LaMelo’s Neon Yellow Lamborghini Urus is impossible to ignore, as the car features a Hexus fluorescent wrap, a 1016 Industries widebody kit, and massive 24-inch wheels. This 641-horsepower SUV with 4.0 liter and V8 engine is his daily driver for making a statement. Ball has included other personal touches like the custom red “RARE” calipers and bright orange interior.This car holds a special place in LaMelo Ball’s collection as it was a gift from his father, LaVar Ball, for his 16th birthday. The car is reported to be valued at $185,000, and it’s one of the older models in his garage. With a classic V10-powered Gallardo, the car is customised from blue to a neon colour to create a “not from here” style for the budding NBA star.",The 24-year-old Charlotte Hornets star's collection is valued at over $1.2 million.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar Vembu said Sarvam AI's work shows that ‘world-class AI’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Instagram’s beauty filters and free expression



Underage users and enforcement



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has testified in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday (February 18). According to a report by CNBC, Zuckerberg informed that court that he had reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2018 to discuss the ‘well being of teens and kids’. The comments from Meta CEO came after the defense lawyers presented emails between the two executives, aiming to highlight that Zuckerberg was proactive about the safety of kids and teens on Instagram . “I care about the wellbeing of teens and kids who are using our services,” Zuckerberg said.The central issue in the trial is whether Instagram’s beauty filters harmed young users. Lawyers pressed Zuckerberg on internal discussions about banning cosmetic surgery filters after experts warned that these filters will have negative impact of the teenage girls. The report adds that Zuckernger acknowledged the concerns but mentioned that the decision came down to free expression. “I genuinely want to err on the side of giving people the ability to express themselves,” he testified.Along with this, the case also centers on the allegations that Meta designed Instagram to maximise the time spent on the app. However, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying that the engagement metrics were used as internal milestones rather than company goals.The evidence presented in the court included documents from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, showing targets to increase daily user time to 40 minutes in 2023 and 46 minutes in 2026.The lawyers also questioned whether Meta adequately prevents under-13 users from joining Instagram. As the documents presented before the court revealed that nearly 4 million children under the age of 13 are using the platform in the US. Replying to the question, Meta CEO admitted that some users lie about their age but he also said that Meta removes underage accounts when identified and Instagram only began requiring birthdays at sign‑up in late 2019.The trial also saw unusual moments, with Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl warning that anyone using AI smart glasses during testimony would be held in contempt. Members of Zuckerberg’s team were photographed wearing Meta’s Ray‑Ban AI glasses before entering the courthouse.The Los Angeles case is one of several lawsuits this year accusing social media companies of harming young users’ mental health. Meta faces another trial in New Mexico, where the state’s attorney general alleges the company failed to protect children from online predators.",Mark Zuckerberg testified in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday (February 18) The central issue in the trial is whether Instagram’s beauty filters harmed young users.

Architecturally, what differentiates it from global models beyond just size?

How deeply is the model trained in Indic languages? Can it outperform global models in low-resource languages?

Was the model trained entirely on domestic infrastructure? How will you make inference affordable at scale?

You’re moving beyond traditional mobile platforms. What’s the strategy behind expanding into devices like smart glasses and feature phones?

. How do you address hallucination and cultural bias?

What is the next milestone for Indic LLMs?

In a significant push to strengthen India’s advanced AI capabilities, homegrown startup Sarvam launched a 105-billion-parameter foundational large language model (LLM), along with a suite of tools designed for commercial use. Co-founder Vivek Raghavan discussed the company’s progress in Indic languages and its expansion into AI-powered devices.This is the largest model trained from scratch in India, with zero external data dependency and a strong grounding in Indian knowledge. While it is a global model, it is built with Indian contexts in mind. Models like Gemini or ChatGPT are still an order of magnitude larger, so we are not claiming parity in scale. However, being smaller makes our models more efficient and cost-effective. For most real-world and agentic use cases, models of this size deliver excellent results without requiring extreme scale.We are far more focused on Indian languages than most global labs.Among models of comparable size, we are superior in Indian languages. It is not fair to compare systems tens of times larger, but within our size category, we are stronger. What specific progress did you make in Indian languages? We believe Indians will experience AI primarily through voice. In speech recognition across Indian languages and dialects, we believe we are the best in the world. Our newer models are world-class in natural speech synthesis. We also released a small vision model that outperforms much larger systems at extracting Indic scripts from documents and images. Among similarly sized LLMs, we are equivalent or better than most. For instance, we outperformed a DeepSeek model released last year, and even compared favourably with a version 6 times larger. Our goal is to lead globally within our size class, especially in Indian language and domain-specific contexts.Yes, it was trained entirely in India under the India AI mission, using concessional GPUs and no external data dependency. Inference is a separate challenge. Training does not guarantee adoption. We will enable access to our models, but competing in pure B2C is difficult when global players offer free services after spending billions. That is a structural reality.AI will change interfaces. We see smart glasses as business devices for recording conversations, analytics and coaching, with voice at the centre. Feature phone integrations are about inclusion—enabling users to access AI in their own language. We also aim to run small models directly on devices to reduce costs and cloud dependency. The focus is inclusion and more natural interaction.LLMs are probabilistic, so hallucinations are inherent. The solution is to build grounding mechanisms around them. No real-world system uses a raw LLM. The aim is to minimise risk, though some residual risk always exists.We were the first to highlight the “tokenisation tax” in Indian languages. If tokenisation improves, costs will fall. However, global labs are investing billions and offering models for free, often using free-user data to train systems. That dynamic is unprecedented and shapes the competitive landscape.",Sarvam launched a 105-billion-parameter foundational large language model (LLM) Co-founder Vivek Raghavan discussed the company’s progress in Indic languages and its expansion into AI-powered devices.

Robots can also forget their ‘sense of navigation’: Scientists say they’ve finally solved 'kidnapped robot problem',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/robots-can-also-forget-their-sense-of-navigation-scientists-say-theyve-finally-solved-kidnapped-robot-problem/articleshow/128592563.cms,"How a weak navigation system disrupts robot navigation



What is the technique behind Monte Carlo Localisation



What this could mean for the future of robotics



Robots are becoming increasingly capable and independent, yet one surprisingly simple issue continues to challenge engineers. Robots sometimes lose track of where they are. This situation is widely known as the kidnapped robot problem that occurs when a robot is suddenly moved, powered off, or placed in an unfamiliar environment, leaving it unable to determine its location.Researchers in Spain now say a new artificial intelligence system might help solve this long-standing challenge. Scientists at Miguel Hernández University of Elche have reportedly developed a localisation method that allows robots to recover their position even when the surroundings change, as reported by Euro News. The approach combines AI with advanced 3D scanning, creating a navigation system that appears to mimic how humans orient themselves in unfamiliar spaces.The kidnapped robot problem highlights how weak robotic navigation can be. A robot might be relocated during maintenance, experience a power outage, or be physically moved to a different area. When this happens, its internal map no longer aligns with reality.Many robots depend on satellite navigation systems such as GPS. These systems work well outdoors but often fail indoors or near tall buildings where signals weaken.As a result, robots operating in warehouses, hospitals, or dense urban environments face ongoing localisation difficulties.The research team developed a system called MCL-DLF, short for Monte Carlo Localisation Deep Local Feature. The method uses 3D LiDAR technology, which scans the surroundings with laser pulses to generate a detailed map of the environment.The process appears similar to human navigation. Robots first identify large environmental features such as buildings, walls, or vegetation. After establishing a general area, they refine their position by analysing smaller details.Lead researcher Míriam Máximo explained that the approach mirrors how people orient themselves in unfamiliar places. Humans often recognise landmarks before focusing on specific details to determine their precise location. The system also maintains multiple possible location estimates simultaneously. These estimates are continuously updated as new sensor data arrives, allowing robots to adjust their understanding of their surroundings in real time.Researchers tested the new system over several months on the university campus under varying conditions. These included seasonal changes, different lighting scenarios, and shifts in vegetation. The results reportedly showed improved positioning accuracy and more consistent performance compared with conventional localisation methods.Reliable localisation is central to many robotics applications. Service robots in healthcare settings, logistics automation in warehouses, infrastructure inspection systems, environmental monitoring tools, and autonomous vehicles all depend on accurate positioning.If robots can recover their location after disruption, their independence and reliability increase.","Scientists at Miguel Hernández University of Elche have reportedly developed a localisation method that allows robots to recover their position.

We're entering a world that anticipates and automates: NXP CTO Reger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/were-entering-a-world-that-anticipates-and-automates-nxp-cto-reger/articleshow/128592308.cms,"New Delhi: Imagine a world where your home unlocks as you approach, adjusts the temperature before you feel the chill, quietly monitors your health, and safeguards your property without a single visible barrier. Your car becomes a rolling living room, steering, braking, and navigating hazards long before they enter your line of sight. In factories, humans no longer wrestle with machines but supervise fleets of intelligent systems. This, said Lars Reger, global chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, is the next phase of technological evolution: “a world that anticipates and automates.”Over the next decade, Reger predicts that tens of billions of smart, connected robots will be embedded in homes, cars, hospitals, and infrastructure. However different their form factors, they will share four essential capabilities: sensing, thinking, connecting, and acting. Devices will perceive their environment, draw on cloud intelligence, make decisions, and execute them physically. Yet none of this matters, he warned, if users cannot trust the device. Trust means functional safety and cybersecurity—braking systems that never fail, thermostats that do not overheat homes, and cars that cannot be hacked.Autonomous systems have faltered before because, in his view, they were designed incorrectly. The solution, he argued, is to take inspiration from biology. The human body separates fast, deterministic reflexes from higher cognition; not every decision requires a vast AI brain. “How big does the AI really have to be?” he asked, noting that an ant’s 100,000 neurons can create an efficient transportation system.The future, according to Reger, lies at the edge: ultra-low-power chips, AI accelerators consuming as little as seven watts, radar that can see through fog, and car-to-car communication that functions almost like telepathy. Data centres will remain important, but the real democratisation of AI, he insisted, “lies at the famous edge in the end device”—in billions of quiet, trusted machines that anticipate our needs before we voice them.","Lars Reger, global chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, predicts that tens of billions of smart, connected robots will be embedded in homes, cars, hospitals, and infrastructure.

Secure your chatbots — or your wife may learn your secrets: Nikesh Arora,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/secure-your-chatbots-or-your-wife-may-learn-your-secrets-nikesh-arora/articleshow/128592222.cms,"New Delhi: What if your spouse discovered your deepest secrets by scrolling through your chatbot conversations? Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks, says companies like his are racing to address emerging risks in an increasingly AI-reliant world.“My fear is that in about six months, if I’m talking to my AI model, it might know more things about me than I’ve told my wife,” he told the audience at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday. “I don’t want my wife to get her hands on my Gemini prompts because I’m surprised what it might tell her.”The remark drew laughs but underscored a serious concern: AI systems are fast becoming therapists, nutritionists, financial advisers and confidants. Users are sharing intimate details with machines that promise convenience and insight. As Arora noted, if that data “falls into the wrong hands, it’s not a good idea.”The broader danger, he argued, is structural. “AI is accelerating faster than our institutions, our governance frameworks, and even our intuition,” he said. At present, “the balance is tilted… not in the favour of trust, inclusion, security; it’s actually tilted in the favour of speed.”Every week brings new models and capabilities, often released before guardrails are fully formed.As the world moves toward an “agentic” future — where AI systems can act autonomously — the risks multiply. “As soon as you give control to an agent, you have to worry about who’s responsible for the actions of those agents,” he said. If an AI mismanages your investments or transfers money without consent, accountability becomes blurred. The same applies to physical systems: how do you ensure that a robot designed to assist at home cannot be hijacked or manipulated?Arora was blunt about the limits of prohibition. “AI is not going to go away if you govern it out of existence. It cannot be governed out of existence,” he said. The answer, instead, lies in embedding governance and accountability into the technology itself.For cybersecurity firms, that means building protection from the outset. AI must be “secure, governed and controlled” — not patched after damage is done. That includes safeguarding vast datasets, monitoring AI-generated code that could be malicious or flawed, and preparing for adversarial AI systems designed to exploit vulnerabilities.Yet Arora clarified that he remains optimistic — not only that we will navigate this new terrain, but that it will create new opportunities. “I have a conviction that we’re going to need five times the number of technology people in the future than we have today,” he said, arguing that security, governance and oversight will generate new roles rather than eliminate them.","CEO of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks says companies are racing to address emerging risks in an increasingly AI-reliant world.

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Why Mark Zuckerberg's trial matters

In a high-stakes trial unfolding in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm. The case centers on allegations that Meta’s platforms, including Instagram , were designed in ways that deliberately promote addictive use among children and teens, contributing to serious mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. The trial, which also includes Google’s YouTube as a co-defendant, is widely regarded as one of the most consequential legal tests confronting Big Tech in recent years. A verdict here could influence thousands of similar lawsuits nationwide.The civil suit was filed by a plaintiff identified as “KGM,” now 20, who alleges that using platforms like Instagram from a young age fostered compulsive behaviour and exacerbated her mental health struggles. Her lawyers argue that Meta’s engagement-driven features, such as algorithmic recommendation systems and infinite scrolling, are engineered to keep young users engaged in ways that mirror addictive design practices used in other industries. Meta, for its part, vigorously denies these claims and maintains that the company has no intention to addict children or to profit from youth vulnerability. In court testimony, Zuckerberg emphasised that Meta does not allow children under 13 on Instagram, though he acknowledged it is “very difficult” to verify ages and enforce this rule perfectly.During his testimony, Zuckerberg faced intense questioning about internal policies, platform design goals and historical strategy decisions. Plaintiffs’ attorneys challenged him over past internal documents suggesting that Meta once tracked metrics related to user time spent on its apps, a key indicator critics use to argue the company prioritised engagement over safety. While Zuckerberg insisted that Meta has shifted away from those metrics in recent years, he stopped short of admitting that the platforms were engineered to intentionally create addictive behaviours.Another flashpoint in the courtroom was Instagram’s age-restriction enforcement. Zuckerberg reiterated that under-13 use is prohibited but also conceded that age verification is imperfect and that many young users misrepresent their birth years to gain access. Plaintiffs seized on this admission, arguing that Meta has known about underage engagement for years yet did not do enough to protect minors. Meta’s legal team countered by pointing to new safety features and protections rolled out in recent years, while asserting that external factors beyond their control contribute to how and why young people interact with social media.During testimony in the high-profile social media safety trial, Zuckerberg revealed that he personally reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss the “wellbeing of teens and kids” in the digital ecosystem. The Meta chief said that the conversation was part of broader efforts to explore how major tech platforms can work together to improve online safety standards, particularly for younger users. Zuckerberg framed the outreach as evidence that youth mental health and responsible product design have become cross-industry concerns, not just competitive talking points between Silicon Valley rivals.The disclosure is notable given the often tense relationship between Meta and Apple, especially after Apple’s privacy changes disrupted Meta’s advertising business. By invoking his dialogue with Cook, Zuckerberg appeared to signal that safeguarding minors transcends corporate rivalry. The testimony comes amid mounting scrutiny over how platforms like Instagram are designed and whether engagement-driven features disproportionately affect teens. His remarks suggest that behind the scenes, tech leaders may be engaging in conversations about shared accountability, even as their companies face growing legal and regulatory pressure in courtrooms and legislatures alike.This trial is not just a test of one company’s practices, it reflects a broader legal and cultural moment where society is questioning the role of social media in children’s lives. Similar lawsuits have been filed against other platforms and although companies like TikTok and Snap Inc. reached early settlements, Meta’s case has moved forward, making Zuckerberg’s testimony especially pivotal. Legal experts describe the case as potentially precedential, with far-reaching implications for how digital platforms must consider safety in their design and business decisions.Significantly, the trial parallels debates currently unfolding in governments around the world about regulating online spaces. Some lawmakers have called for stricter age controls, algorithmic transparency and safety mandates for social media companies. In the US, discussions over reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that broadly shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, have gained traction in light of cases like this one. A ruling against Meta could embolden calls for updated regulatory frameworks, while a defence victory might reinforce existing legal protections.The outcome of this trial could have multiple ripple effects. A decision against Meta could open the door for similar liability claims against other tech giants. Governments may feel increased urgency to legislate online child safety and enforce stricter age verification. Tech companies might re-examine features such as recommendation algorithms, engagement metrics and design choices linked to youth usage.The trial has amplified public discourse on the mental health impacts of social media, especially for vulnerable populations like teens and pre-teens. Critics liken this case to the Big Tobacco lawsuits of the past, where corporate design and marketing practices were scrutinised for contributing to widespread harm. If the jury finds Meta accountable or if significant evidence alters public perception, the digital landscape could face new standards of corporate responsibility and safety compliance.A landmark trial in Los Angeles is testing whether Meta’s social media platforms intentionally foster addictive use and harm children’s mental health. Mark Zuckerberg testified that while Meta prohibits under-13 users and has moved away from maximising screen time goals, age enforcement is challenging and the company disputes the core allegations. The lawsuit and thousands like it could reshape Big Tech liability, regulation and product design across the global digital ecosystem. The case is seen as a bellwether for future legal actions and regulatory reforms related to youth safety online.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm.

Al Nasr Mosque opens in Sharjah

Glass dome architecture

20 metres in diameter and 16 metres tall, it covers almost 80% of the mosque roof.

Built from honeycomb-patterned hexagonal glass panels, it reflects light throughout the day.

At sunset, as golden light pours through the dome into the prayer hall, the space appears to glow, creating a spiritually uplifting ambience.

Welcoming worshippers

A new Ramadan landmark







In a city known for its record-breaking skyscrapers, one of its most breathtaking architectural triumphs is tucked away in the historic heart of Oud Metha. The Al Nasr Mosque (also known as the Great Mosque of Al Nasr) stands as a unique masterpiece in the UAE’s landscape. While most traditional mosques feature solid stone domes, Al Nasr breaks the mold with a structure that feels as though it is reaching directly for the sky.In time for the start of Ramadan 2026, Sharjah inaugurated a striking new place of prayer, Al Nasr Mosque, designed to serve over 1,300 worshippers and bring both spiritual and architectural beauty to the community.Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah, officially opened the mosque on the evening of the moon-sighting announcement that confirmed Ramadan’s arrival.Located in the Jabal Omar neighbourhood of Al Dhaid, the mosque covers more than 7,800 square metres, providing prayer, reflection, and social space for residents of Sharjah and nearby areas.The architectural centerpiece of Al Nasr Mosque is its large spherical glass dome:Next to the dome rises a 38-metre-tall minaret with gently flowing lines, a modern twist on classical mosque silhouettes that harmonises with the round dome instead of rigidly following tradition.The mosque’s layout has been meticulously designed to foster a sense of both comfort and community, providing ample room for the faithful to gather. The main prayer hall offers an intimate setting for 470 worshippers, while the expansive external courtyard and outdoor prayer zones can accommodate an additional 1,180 male worshippers, ensuring that large congregations can pray together during peak times.A dedicated women’s prayer hall provides a private and serene space for 145 worshippers, bringing the total capacity to over 1,300 people.Beyond its primary function as a place of worship, the mosque serves as a comprehensive community hub. It is equipped with essential amenities, including modern ablution areas, restrooms, and a water station.For the staff and ongoing spiritual guidance, the complex includes an imam’s residence. It also looks toward the future of the community with a public reading library and practical facilities such as a mortuary and ample parking.Inside, the architecture emphasizes openness and serenity; the hall is bathed in natural light, complemented by a modern mimbar (pulpit) featuring soft built-in lighting that enhances the spiritual atmosphere without overwhelming the worshippers.The inauguration of Al Nasr Mosque is part of a much larger, nationwide effort to enhance mosque facilities and support growing congregations across the UAE. In Sharjah, this initiative has driven the construction and renovation of dozens of mosques, ensuring every community has access to a modern, well-equipped place of worship.Across the Emirates, mosques are expanding their roles beyond prayer by launching creative Ramadan programs for families and children to encourage community engagement. These efforts are supported by practical measures, such as providing free parking for worshippers in busy areas, reflecting the UAE's commitment to making the spiritual journey of Ramadan as accessible and rewarding as possible for all.","Sharjah’s new Al Nasr Mosque opens for Ramadan with a breathtaking glass dome.

"In New Zealand, a judge wrestles with AI-assisted apology",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-new-zealand-a-judge-wrestles-with-ai-assisted-apology/articleshow/128536265.cms,"Image: IANS





A judge in New Zealand who discovered last week that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence raised questions about the sincerity of her sentiments.“The issue of remorse is interesting,” said the judge, Tom Gilbert, of the district court in Christchurch, as he mulled the punishment of a woman who had pleaded guilty to arson and other charges. Remorse can be a mitigating factor in sentencing. Her letters to the victims and the court were nicely written, the judge said. “Out of curiosity I punched into two AI tools ‘draft me a letter for a judge expressing remorse,’” the judge said, according to a transcript of the sentencing hearing. “It became immediately apparent that these were two AI-generated letters, albeit with tweaks around the edges.”Judge Gilbert said he was not criticising the defendant’s use of AI. “But certainly when one is considering the genuineness of an individual’s remorse, simply producing a computer-generated letter does not really take me anywhere as far as I am concerned,” he said, according to the transcript.The judge was not alone in wrestling with the question of authenticity in AI-assisted writing.Increasingly, people are outsourcing many tasks to machines, including writing apologies, eulogies and wedding vows inviting the ire of some of their fellow humans.Social scientists say the questions raised by use of these tools go beyond etiquette. “It’s a mirror into who we are and what we care about as humans,” Jim Everett, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kent in Britain, said about the case.Everett worked on a series of recent studies on the perception of AI use and users. Across the six studies Everett worked on, 4,000 participants were asked about 20 tasks. The aim was to understand how people perceive those who use AI. “AI is a tool for efficiency, and it can be helpful, but it also typically involves, and signals, reduced effort,” Everett said. But the use of such tools acts as a kind of proxy for character traits, the researchers found. The findings suggest that people generally perceived those using AI as lazier, less competent and less trustworthy, and their work as less meaningful.The situation in the New Zealand court was a real-life test of the perceptions that the researchers sought to identify. “An AI could be perfectly trained on all apologies but one might still think that a specific apology it then generates in a new instance is not authentic because it does not come from the kind of processes deemed important in an apology: a personal recollection of the wrong, a commitment to change,” the study said.Judge Gilbert said he was willing to give the defendant some credit for genuine remorse. But he granted only a 5% reduction in the sentence. He sentenced the defendant to 27 months in prison.","A New Zealand judge discovered that apology letters from a defendant in an arson case had been written with the help of artificial intelligence.

Scientists spot glowing green microbes in a pitch-dark Carlsbad Caverns cave



Cave microbes use near-infrared light to photosynthesise at record low levels



Research reshapes search for extraterrestrial life



Extreme cave environments preserve early adaptations





Microbial communities hidden deep inside the caves of New Mexico have fascinated scientists who study extreme environments and search for extraterrestrial life. In 2018, the team of scientists at Carlsbad Caverns came across strange green colonies on the limestone walls, which were very far away from the natural light. Later, these microbes were confirmed to be cyanobacteria, which have the ability to conduct photosynthesis using near-infrared light. According to the study, these bacteria have existed in their present form for the last 4 to 9 million years. This discovery indicates that life is able to exist even under conditions that had been regarded as too dark to support life.The research, which was done by Hazel Barton of the University of Alabama and Lars Behrendt of Uppsala University, has a potential impact on biology and astrobiology. Besides that, it reveals how organisms modify themselves to survive with very low energy supplies in enclosed and low-light environments.The discovery was made in an alcove that appeared entirely black to the eye. When researchers shone a torch across the wall, a bright green layer became visible. The colour was striking against the stone. Laboratory testing showed the growth consisted of cyanobacteria, single-celled organisms often linked to surface environments where sunlight is present.What made this colony different was its location. The area receives no direct sunlight. It sits well beyond the cave entrance. Yet the microbes were active and stable.Further analysis revealed that these organisms contain chlorophyll d and chlorophyll f. These pigments allow absorption of near-infrared light, which sits beyond the range visible to humans. This kind of light is weak and spread out. In the cave, it seems to reflect and spread out from the rock walls in small amounts. Microbes use that little energy to make food through photosynthesis. The process works with less light than has been seen before in animals that are similar. It's not exciting, but it's steady.The finding of the study, “Life in the dark: far-red absorbing cyanobacteria extend photic zones deep into terrestrial caves” , has drawn interest from astrobiologists. Understanding the minimum light conditions needed for photosynthesis helps define where life might survive elsewhere. If organisms can adapt to such restricted wavelengths, planets orbiting dimmer stars may remain possible targets.Hazel Barton has said the work aims to identify the longest wavelength and lowest intensity of light that can sustain photosynthesis. That boundary matters. It shapes telescope surveys and guides modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.Carlsbad Caverns provides a controlled setting, with stable temperature and little disturbance. The cyanobacteria appear to have adjusted over long periods to exploit scarce energy. The ecosystem is simple, almost quiet. There is no immediate suggestion of alien microbes waiting in the darkness. But the cave walls offer a reminder that life can persist where expectations narrow. It changes the margins slightly. Sometimes that is enough.","Scientists spot glowing green microbes in a pitch-dark Carlsbad Caverns cave. Microbes use near-infrared light to photosynthesise at record low levels.

Sediment remains undisturbed in the absence of oxygen





The surface of the Gulf of Aqaba appears calm for most of the year, with little to suggest what sits far below. Nearly 1,800 metres down, researchers have identified a dense pool of highly saline water resting on the seafloor, separated from the surrounding Red Sea. The feature, known as the NEOM brine pools, covers roughly 10,000 square metres, with three smaller pools nearby. Scientists say the water inside is several times saltier than normal seawater and contains almost no oxygen. Because of its weight, the brine remains trapped in a basin, forming what researchers describe as an isolated underwater lake. The discovery adds to growing interest in deep sea brine pools and their role in preserving environmental records in tectonically active regions.The NEOM brine pools were mapped using remotely operated vehicles working at depth in the northern Red Sea. Video and sampling show a clear boundary between normal seawater and the darker, denser brine below. Salinity levels are estimated to be around four times higher than typical seawater. Oxygen is largely absent. Marine animals that stray into the pool appear disoriented and do not remain there for long. The water does not mix easily, so the basin acts as a contained body within the larger sea.According to the study, “Discovery of the deep-sea NEOM Brine Pools in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea"" , the centre of the pool is mostly empty of larger marine life. Conditions are too extreme. Animals that drift too far in appear stunned. At the edges, though, there is activity. Microbes cluster along the thin boundary where oxygenated seawater meets the brine. The chemistry shifts across just a short distance. Bacteria adapted to high salinity seem to thrive there. Small crustaceans have been seen feeding in that narrow strip.Researchers interested in extremophiles pay attention to such places. The environment is harsh but not entirely sterile. It resembles conditions that might have existed in older oceans. That comparison is cautious, not exact.The bottom looks lumpy and calm below the brine. Worms and other animals move through mud and sand all the time in the ocean. Little moves here. Disturbance is limited by the lack of air. It looks like there are a lot of microbes near the line where fresh water meets salt water. Specialised bacteria that can live in low air and high salt levels live in this small area. Small crustaceans and organisms that make shells have also been seen nearby eating microbe growth.Scientists studying extremophile microbes see these habitats as useful analogues for early Earth conditions. Cores taken from the bottom show thin bands of sediment stacked over time. The record may reach back around 1,200 years, though dating is still being refined. Some layers are thicker, composed of sand washed in from sudden floods or underwater landslides.","Researchers have identified a dense pool of highly saline water resting on the seafloor, separated from the surrounding Red Sea.

Part of a broader tourism strategy

A history of state involvement in matchmaking





Singapore has launched a state-backed tourism campaign inviting single Americans to step away from dating apps and try human-led matchmaking, with so-called “aunties” selecting their first date instead of algorithms. The initiative, titled “Aunties, Not Algorithms,” is run by the Singapore Tourism Board and targets US residents aged 21 and above who are frustrated with modern app-based dating. Two selected participants will be paired for a blind date in Singapore, with flights, accommodation and a curated itinerary included. The campaign blends tourism promotion with dating culture, presenting Singapore as a destination built around human connection, food and shared experiences.Interested singles are required to submit an online application that includes personal details and a short video explaining why they should be chosen. Instead of using software or data-driven matching, applications are reviewed manually by a panel of “aunties”. After assessing the entries, the panel will select two individuals and match them for a first date in Singapore. The process is designed to emphasise intuition, personality and cultural compatibility rather than algorithms.The matchmaking panel consists of comedian Atsuko Okatsuka, astrologer and professional matchmaker Aliza Kelly, and Singaporean actor Tan Kheng Hua. In Singapore and across much of Asia, the term “auntie” is commonly used to describe older women who play informal advisory roles within families and communities, often offering guidance on relationships, careers and life decisions. In this campaign, the aunties act strictly as matchmakers and mentors.The selected pair will be flown to Singapore for a four-night stay. The prize package includes return flights, hotel accommodation and an “auntie-approved” itinerary designed to serve as a first date experience. Activities include a Singaporean cooking class with a Michelin-starred chef, along with curated food, cultural and sightseeing experiences intended to showcase the city’s culinary heritage and urban lifestyle.The campaign is open to single Americans aged 21 and above who are legal residents of the United States. Applicants must submit their entries before 13 March 2026, after which the panel will review submissions and select the final pair. The tourism board has said the campaign is limited to one matched couple.Following the campaign’s launch, some social media posts inaccurately suggested that Singapore was encouraging Americans to date older local women or promoting so-called “passport bro” culture. Media reports and official statements clarified that the aunties are not romantic participants but act only as matchmakers, guiding the pairing process and itinerary.The initiative aligns with Singapore’s wider tourism strategy, which increasingly uses pop culture, lifestyle content and experiential campaigns to attract visitors. In recent years, the tourism board has partnered with global artists and productions to feature Singapore in music videos and entertainment projects, using culture-led storytelling to boost international appeal.Government-supported matchmaking is not new in Singapore. In 1984, the government established the Social Development Unit to encourage social interaction and marriage amid concerns about declining birth rates. While that initiative focused on domestic demographics, the current campaign adopts a lighter and more playful approach, using matchmaking as a creative tool to promote tourism and cultural exchange rather than long-term social policy.","Singapore has launched a state-backed tourism campaign inviting single Americans to step away from dating apps and try human-led matchmaking.

Travel patterns will adapt rapidly once fasting begins.These adjusted hours help residents navigate a month where early mornings and late evening activities are more common, particularly around Suhoor (pre-dawn) and Iftar (sunset breaking of fast).The extended Friday night service until 1 am reflects the city’s social rhythm, as many events and prayers occur later in the evening.Ramadan alters daily life in Dubai: work schedules shift earlier, fasting affects peak travel times, and evening social and religious activities extend late into the night.The RTA says the updated Metro schedule ensures greater convenience and service alignment with people’s needs, especially around prayer times, sunset, and Iftar gatherings.Alongside the Metro, other transport services also feature updated timings:These adjustments ensure public transport supports daily life throughout the fasting period and beyond sunset into the night.Parking in Dubai has received a thoughtful ""Iftar Break."" For 2026, the RTA has implemented a two-shift payment system for all paid zones from Monday to Saturday. This is designed to give your wallet a rest exactly when you need it most.As for Salik (Tolls), the peak hour rate of AED 6 applies from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Outside these hours, it drops to AED 4, and it is completely free between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM, which is perfect for those traveling for early Suhoor.As Ramadan reshapes daily life across the city, Dubai Metro’s revised schedule ensures residents and visitors can move smoothly from early morning commutes to late-night gatherings.With extended Friday hours and adjusted weekday services, the new timings reflect the rhythm of the holy month, balancing work, worship and family time. Commuters are advised to plan journeys in advance and check official updates from Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to avoid last-minute rushes during peak Iftar hours.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan.

UAE's new Salik toll fees adjustments for Ramadan 2026: What drivers in emirates need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uaes-new-salik-toll-fees-adjustments-for-ramadan-2026-what-drivers-in-emirates-need-to-know/articleshow/128420631.cms,"Ramadan 2026: How Will Salik Toll Fees Affect Your Dubai Commute?

What is changing with Salik toll fees in the UAE



Monday to Saturday



Dh6 (peak rate): 9 am – 5 pm

9 am – 5 pm Dh4 (off-peak rate): 7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am

7 am – 9 am and 5 pm – 2 am Free (off-peak): 2 am – 7 am

Sunday (excluding public holidays and events)



Dh4 (both peak and off-peak): 7 am – 2 am

7 am – 2 am Free: 2 am – 7 am

Why the Salik toll structure is changing in the UAE

Later starts and shorter days during Ramadan mean peak travel times often shift compared to the rest of the year.

Salik’s new timing accounts for this by extending lower toll periods into early evening and late night, periods when many residents are commuting for iftar (sunset fast-breaking) and evening prayers or social engagements.

Free toll hours in the early pre-dawn period (2 am – 7 am) support non-peak travel and reflect typical reduced road usage.

Quick takeaways for UAE drivers



Expect different Salik charges during Ramadan 2026, with peak hours now between 9 am and 5 pm.

Off-peak and late-night travel is cheaper or free, encouraging motorists to travel outside busy hours.

Adjust your commuting plans, especially around iftar and early mornings, to avoid unexpected toll charges.





With Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19), pending the official moon sighting on February 17, Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month. These updates aim to improve traffic flow and commuting comfort in line with altered work and school schedules across the city.Salik has introduced a variable pricing structure for toll gates during Ramadan 2026 to better align with expected traffic patterns:These adjustments reflect the shifted daily rhythm in Ramadan, where working hours and schooling usually start later and end earlier to accommodate fasting, prayer, and family time.The revised toll schedule is not simply about price, it is part of a broader strategy to smooth traffic flow across Dubai’s busiest routes during Ramadan:Similar adjustments have been reported in other transport and city services as part of Ramadan preparation, including variable parking timings and public transport schedule shifts. These toll changes come alongside wider seasonal shifts across the UAE as communities prepare for Ramadan.Work hours and school schedules are reduced or revised for the holy month to help residents observe fasting and prayer times comfortably. Other services like parking fees and public transit operations are also adjusted to better align with Ramadan routines. The adjustments aim to support both residents and visitors during what is one of the most significant months in the UAE’s cultural and religious calendar.As Ramadan approaches, keeping track of these changes can help drivers in the UAE plan trips more efficiently and avoid higher toll costs in peak windows.", Ramadan 1447 AH (2026) expected to begin in the UAE on either Wednesday or Thursday (around February 18–19) Dubai’s road toll operator Salik has announced changes to toll fees to reflect shifts in daily routines during the holy month.

'Suicide’ was actually hit-and-run: Dubai Police use AI-powered digital twin to crack case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suicide-was-actually-hit-and-run-dubai-police-use-ai-powered-digital-twin-to-crack-case/articleshow/128412079.cms,"Dubai Police use advanced Digital Twin technology to digitally reconstruct crime scenes / AI image

Dubai Police solve hit-and-run with AI tech

What is “Digital Twin” tech?

Smart policing in the UAE





Dubai has once again stepped into the future of law enforcement. The Dubai Police General Department of Forensic Evidence and Criminology has officially integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.This cutting-edge system creates a precise, high-definition virtual replica of a physical crime scene. By using advanced 3D scanning and laser mapping, detectives can now move through a digital version of a room or outdoor area with millimeter accuracy.This means the original environment is ""frozen in time,"" allowing investigators to examine every corner of a scene without actually being there physically.In a striking example of 21st-century policing, Dubai Police used its new Digital Twin technology to overturn the initial conclusion in a bridge-fall incident involving a delivery rider. What first appeared to be a suicide quickly became a hit-and-run case after investigators digitally reconstructed the scene.Using highly detailed 3D modelling and virtual reality tools, officers discovered that the rider’s motorcycle had been struck from behind by another vehicle, causing him to fall from the bridge. The fleeing driver left no trace at the scene, but the Digital Twin analysis offered clear visual and scientific evidence to rewrite the narrative and reclassify the case as a crime rather than a tragic self-inflicted act.This wasn’t the only success for the system. Digital Twin also solved a structural collapse investigation involving a basement parking facility. What appeared to be a mysterious failure was revealed through advanced modelling as the result of repeated water leakage that weakened concrete supports over time. By simulating load stresses with scientific precision, police could pinpoint the exact mechanism of collapse.Unlike traditional forensic methods that rely solely on physical evidence and witness statements, Digital Twin builds a virtual replica of a crime scene using cutting-edge technology. This system merges 3D scanning, artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics into a unified, interactive digital environment.Investigators can revisit this virtual scene at any time, examine evidence from multiple angles, test hypotheses, and even simulate possible sequences of events, all without returning physically to the location. The models are auditable, transparent and designed to support data-driven decision-making, making them especially valuable in courtrooms where evidence must withstand intense scrutiny.The Digital Twin process unfolds in three stages: first, the scene is digitally documented in full detail; then data is refined and enhanced; finally, advanced analytical tools produce intelligent models and outputs that help investigators understand what really happened.Since its rollout, the Digital Twin system has already clarified nearly 85 incidents, according to Dubai Police project managers. By virtually walking through these scenes, investigators can reduce errors, accelerate analysis time, and provide stronger, more reliable forensic conclusions in the judicial process.The Digital Twin initiative isn’t just innovative, it’s award-winning. The technology received a 7-star rating and was named Best Innovative Project at the International Best Practices Competition (IBPC) 2025, as well as winning the UAE Ideas Award 2025 in Smart Government and Digital Transformation.Senior police engineers highlight that Digital Twin is part of a broader strategy to embed technology and AI into all facets of law enforcement in Dubai. The goal is to make criminal investigations faster, more accurate, and more aligned with modern digital realities.This drive aligns with directives from leadership to position Dubai Police as a global leader in tech-powered law enforcement, a vision backed by investments in AI, virtual reality, and data analytics.","Dubai Police has integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.

First solar eclipse of 2026: Can UAE residents see the ‘Ring of Fire’ on February 17?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/first-solar-eclipse-of-2026-can-uae-residents-see-the-ring-of-fire-on-february-17/articleshow/128409351.cms,"Skywatchers worldwide are preparing for the first solar eclipse of 2026, set to occur on February 17, 2026 / AI Image

What is the ‘Ring of Fire’ eclipse?

How to watch from the UAE?



The partial phase begins at 1:56 PM UAE time (GST), with the ""Ring of Fire"" reaching its peak at 4:12 PM UAE time.

Look for live streams from NASA or the Virtual Telescope Project. These broadcasts will provide high-definition views from the frozen continent, allowing you to enjoy the celestial choreography without the 14-hour flight or the sub-zero temperatures.

Next eclipse coming in August





Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026. Known as an ""annular"" eclipse, it happens when the Moon is too far from Earth to completely cover the Sun, leaving a brilliant, fiery ring visible around its edges.However, for those of us in the UAE, there is a catch: the ""Path of Annularity"" is incredibly narrow and remote, sweeping almost exclusively over Antarctica.Because the alignment happens while the Sun is below our local horizon, the eclipse will be entirely invisible from the UAE sky. While we won’t see the sky go dark over the Burj Khalifa, the event remains a major global scientific milestone. Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 17, the world will witness the first solar eclipse of 2026.The term “ring of fire” refers to the bright circle of sunlight that remains visible during an annular solar eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, temporarily blocking sunlight. However, during an annular eclipse, the Moon is slightly farther away from Earth in its orbit.Because of this increased distance, the Moon appears smaller in the sky and cannot completely cover the Sun’s surface.Instead of plunging the sky into darkness like a total solar eclipse, a thin, brilliant ring of sunlight surrounds the Moon’s dark silhouette.This glowing halo creates the dramatic “ring of fire” effect that captivates skywatchers. Unlike a total solar eclipse, an annular eclipse never produces full darkness because a portion of the Sun always remains visible. During the February 17, 2026 event, this striking ring effect will last for up to about two minutes and twenty seconds at peak viewing locations.Just because you can't see it from your balcony doesn't mean you have to miss the show. Since the eclipse unfolds in one of the most desolate places on Earth, several space agencies and research stations in Antarctica are preparing to share the view.If February feels like a missed opportunity, there is good news. A total solar eclipse will occur on August 12, 2026, visible across parts of Europe including Spain and Iceland. While it will still not be visible from the UAE, it is geographically closer and may attract eclipse chasers from the region planning travel.Additionally, 2026 will feature other astronomical highlights, including lunar eclipses and meteor showers that may be visible from UAE skies.","The first solar eclipse of 2026 will occur on February 17, 2026.

Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","UAE has announced a strategic global partnership with Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX.

Dubai City Walk: A post-iftar social hub for Ramadan 2026



What this means for Dubai residents and visitors





As Ramadan 2026 begins from February 19 or 20, 2026, Dubai is rolling out one of its most ambitious celebration calendars yet, blending traditional spiritual observances with city-wide visual spectacles designed to unite residents, visitors and families after iftar every evening. From night-sky drone light shows to cultural installations and community gatherings, the emirate is turning Ramadan into a vibrant festival of light, art and shared experience under the stars.One of the standout features of Dubai’s 2026 Ramadan calendar is its coordinated drone light shows, which will illuminate the night sky with artistic formations inspired by the holy month. These shows are more than just pretty visuals; they are thematic stories expressed through technology that reflect Ramadan’s spirit of reflection, community and renewal.The drone displays will run nightly from February 19 to March 19, inviting audiences across the city to look up and engage with light as a medium of cultural storytelling. Dubai’s use of drones, a hallmark of its contemporary festival culture, represents a fusion of tradition and innovation in public celebrations.In addition to drones, fireworks displays will enliven key locations like Al Seef and Dubai Creek throughout Ramadan, creating shared moments of spectacle shortly after sunset.These fireworks, timed for post-iftar evenings, are designed to enhance the festive ambience of the season and give families and communities something to look forward to each night.The combination of fireworks and drones mirrors Dubai’s approach to past celebrations, like New Year’s Eve events and shopping festivals, where visual performances play a central role in citywide gatherings.Beyond aerial shows, Dubai is hosting “Ramadan Reflections (Atyaf Ramadaniyah)”, a large-scale series of visual and cultural installations across 10 public locations, including Al Seef and Dubai Festival City Mall. These spaces will feature artistic expressions, from light sculptures to narrative art, that evoke the soulful essence of Ramadan through reflection and ambience.These installations are designed to complement evening routines: prayer, iftar, family walks, and community interactions. Residents can explore themed exhibits while strolling or dining, making the evenings both reflective and energising.Another highlight on the Ramadan calendar is the evening programming at City Walk, which opens its space to extended entertainment, dining and cultural interaction from February 17 to March 18. With ambient décor and a relaxed atmosphere, City Walk aims to be a central post-iftar gathering spot where friends and families connect over food and cultural activities.This initiative reflects Dubai’s broader effort to balance spiritual observance with inclusive social experiences, particularly in open-air venues where residents can enjoy the cooler night air and Ramadan ambience together.Dubai’s festive calendar, combining religious tradition with modern spectacle, highlights how the city embraces Ramadan as both a sacred period of reflection and an opportunity to bring communities together. The nightly drone shows and fireworks provide unifying moments that encourage shared city experiences, while installations and social spaces foster deeper cultural engagement.For visitors and new residents, this calendar offers a unique way to experience Ramadan, not just through mosque attendance and family iftars but through public art, technology displays and communal evenings that echo with celebration and meaning. Dubai’s approach exemplifies how global cities are reimagining Ramadan: honouring religious devotion while incorporating cutting-edge entertainment and cultural expression.The use of technology (like drones), combined with age-old communal values, gives this year’s celebration a distinctive flavour that reflects both innovation and heritage. Whether watching the night sky light up with synchronised drones, enjoying fireworks over the creek or exploring illuminated installations around the city, the Ramadan 2026 calendar invites everyone in Dubai to share in experiences that spark joy, reflection and connection.From drone shows and fireworks to cultural installations and lively evening venues, Dubai’s Ramadan 2026 calendar is shaping up to be one of the most visually and socially engaging yet, bringing modern spectacle to a time of sacred tradition and community celebration.","Ramadan 2026 begins on February 19 or 20, 2026.

The fashion impact beyond the blue shirt

Why the blue shirt trending now





In an era of viral gowns and headline-grabbing couture, it is not a crystal-encrusted dress or archival tiara setting the fashion agenda but a crisp, powder-blue button-down shirt. The most talked-about piece in royal and style circles this week is this sharply tailored Oxford shirt from London label With Nothing Underneath, worn within days by Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex and American Vogue’s editorial heavyweight Chloe Malle.In fashion terms, that is less coincidence and more cultural signal because when three women who define modern power dressing across monarchy, media and Montecito reach for the same quietly confident staple, it tells us that 2026 is not about excess. It is about precision, polish and above all, it is about the enduring magnetism of a perfectly cut shirt.The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style. The British fashion label is suddenly dominating the style conversation and it is not for a gown or a handbag but the classic blue button-down shirt.The light-blue button-down from London label With Nothing Underneath, popularly known as WNU, has popped up on multiple high-profile figures within days as Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales wore it under a tailored blazer during a visit to Castle Hill Academy in South London to mark Children’s Mental Health Week while Chloe Malle, editorial head of American Vogue, styled it in a video interview alongside icon Anna Wintour . Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, too has worn WNU shirts in the past, including a linen version on her Netflix seriesIt is rare for figures from different royal households, especially ones with distinct personal brands and a top fashion editor to converge on the same piece, which speaks to both the shirt’s versatility and subtle cultural momentum.Founded in 2017 by Pip Durell, a former Tatler and British Vogue professional, With Nothing Underneath specialises in classic shirting inspired by men’s tailoring but sized and proportioned for women. The shirts are inspired by men’s tailoring, British heritage and timeless style, out of Durell’s personal search for shirts that were perfectly adjusted for women, sustainably sourced and stood the test of time.They were borne after years of adjusting men’s shirts for her own use. Combining her fashion knowledge and styling credentials with her own very English, effortless approach to dressing, the brand was launched from her home city of London. Today it has grown to encompass an array of wardrobe essentials, from shirts to tailored trousers, that are not led by trends or fleeting style moments instead, they are designed to be forever items in which to live a life of simplicity. In other words, With Nothing Underneath is not just selling shirts; it is helping define a moment in style that blends classic elegance, accessibility and modern wardrobe versatility.They are pared back, laid back, timeless and effortless clothing and inspired by Carolyn Bessette, Jane Birkin and Charlotte Rampling . The label’s success is measurable with £5.7 million in sales in 2024 and 88% growth over three years. It ranked 52nd on The Sunday Times Hundred list of fastest-growing UK private companies. These numbers suggest that WNU is more than a fleeting celebrity endorsement, it is a brand on the rise.The “Royal effect” still matters. Kate’s sartorial choices have long influenced high street fashion, an impact sometimes referred to as the Kate effect, which can boost British brands by hundreds of millions annually and it is not just high-end. Mainstream retailers are seeing similar spikes. For example:These accessible pieces benefit when “royal style” filters down to everyday wardrobes. This moment also fits a wider fashion pattern in early 2026. Light-blue button-downs are showing up in style guides as versatile essentials for office and casual wear.Colour combinations like pale blue with chocolate brown are being touted as must-try seasonal pairings. Meghan has long embraced similar shirting pieces, reinforcing that timeless tailoring, especially shirts, remains central to polished and “quiet luxury” wardrobes.This is not just about one shirt. It shows how royal wardrobes can shape fashion trends globally. It marks a rare fashion overlap between two of the most watched public figures of the decade and highlights how quality basics, not only flashier pieces, can become cultural touchpoints.","The blue button-down, it seems, is having its royal renaissance as an icon of quintessential British style.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1.

New Delhi: Imagine a world where your home unlocks as you approach, adjusts the temperature before you feel the chill, quietly monitors your health, and safeguards your property without a single visible barrier.

This, said Lars Reger, global chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, is the next phase of technological evolution: ""A world that anticipates and automates.""Over the next decade, Reger predicts that tens of billions of smart, connected robots will be embedded in homes, cars, hospitals and infrastructure. However different their form factors, they will share four essential capabilities: Sensing, thinking, connecting, and acting. Devices will perceive their environment, draw on cloud intelligence, make decisions, and execute them physically. Yet none of this matters, he warned, if users cannot trust the device. Trust means functional safety and cybersecurity - braking systems that never fail, thermostats that do not overheat homes, and cars that cannot be hacked.Autonomous systems have faltered before because, in his view, they were designed incorrectly. The solution, he argued, is to take inspiration from biology. The human body separates fast, deterministic reflexes from higher cognition, Not every decision requires a vast AI brain. ""How big does the AI really have to be?"" he asked, noting that an ant's 100,000 neurons can create an efficient transportation system.The future, according to Reger, lies at the edge: Ultra-low-power chips, AI accelerators consuming as little as seven watts, radar that can see through fog and car-to-car communication that functions almost like telepathy. Data centres will remain important, but the real democratisation of AI, he insisted, ""lies at the famous edge in the end device"" - in billions of quiet, trusted machines that anticipate our needs before we voice them.","Over the next decade, tens of billions of smart, connected robots will be embedded in homes, cars, hospitals and infrastructure.

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

"Apple TV partners with EverPass Media, brings sports content to restaurants, bars",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-tv-partners-with-everpass-media-brings-sports-content-to-restaurants-bars/articleshow/128593071.cms,"Apple schedules March 4 experience event



Apple TV has partnered with EverPass Media to bring the streaming company’s live sports content to bars, restaurants, hotels and gyms, reports news agency Reuters. The agreement expands EverPass Media’s premium sports library that currently includes Paramount+'s UEFA Champions League , Prime Video's ""Thursday Night Football"", and National Basketball Association and Women's NBA content. Announcing the deal, EverPass CEO Alex Kaplan said: “From the continued growth of MLS and the enduring pull of MLB to Formula 1's rapidly expanding global fanbase, Apple 's content strengthens and diversifies our library of premium offerings”.The deal shows Apple’s growing effort to expand its sports content in public places, where large screens and group viewing could help attract more subscribers, increase customer visits, and strengthen its brand presence. This comes as Apple rebranded its streaming service Apple TV+ last year, dropping the plus sign and renaming it as ""Apple TV,"" introducing what the company calls a ""vibrant new identity."" The streaming service launched in November 2019 with ""The Morning Show"" and other star-studded originals and has since earned hundreds of awards.In a related news, Apple has announced a ""special Apple Experience"" event scheduled for March 4 at 9:00 am ET, with simultaneous gatherings planned in New York, London, and Shanghai. The invite features a 3D Apple logo made of yellow, green, and blue discs—colours that match rumoured options for a new low-cost MacBook. Apple is pointedly calling this an ""experience"" rather than an ""event,"" suggesting something smaller and more hands-on than the typical Apple Park keynote.There's no word yet on whether it'll be livestreamed.Bloomberg's Mark Gurman had previously reported that Apple was gearing up for hardware announcements as early as the week of March 2, and this lines up neatly. The company is expected to unveil new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, an M5 MacBook Air, and a budget MacBook powered by an A18 Pro iPhone chip that could start around $699-$750.","Apple TV has partnered with EverPass Media to bring live sports content to bars, restaurants, hotels and gyms.
