A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed Kelce's generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Travis Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact. Whether motivated by love, strategy, or genuine goodwill, one thing is clear: lives in Kansas City will be changed for the better.","Travis Kelce recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.

New features for Copilot



Microsoft AI head, Mustafa Suleyman , recently spoke at the company’s 50th anniversary celebration about how Microsoft tracks the progress of its AI assistant , Copilot. He explained that his team measures things like daily and weekly users, how widely Copilot is being used, and how much people are engaging with it. However, Suleyman’s main focus is on something different. He said, “I really, really focus the team on SSR, the rate of successful sessions.”In the past, when customers didn’t give real-time feedback, companies measured success by how much time people spent using products, like on social media, or how many problems the product solved. “Now, we actually get to learn from the anonymized logs and extract the sentiment,” said Suleyman, who joined Microsoft a year ago after leading Inflection AI, a startup.Suleyman explained that Microsoft now uses an AI model to help figure out the sentiment behind users' interactions with Copilot. This helps measure SSR.“Over the last four months, it’s gone up dramatically, and that’s what we optimize for,” he added. He, however, didn’t share exact numbers or other specific metrics for Copilot’s performance.Last fall, Microsoft introduced a new, friendlier voice for Copilot and added a feature to analyze web pages for users. Recently, the company also showcased new features for Copilot, like personalized podcasts, a tool to help with researching tough questions, and the ability for Copilot to be customized to each person and conversation.When asked what he would like Copilot to look like, Suleyman said, “I would definitely go for something that was cutesy,” adding, “like a little Furby-type thing.”","Microsoft AI head Mustafa Suleyman recently spoke at the company’s 50th anniversary celebration.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one. This strain gives the consumers anti-gravity and glowing effects.$165 base, up to $200 with negotiationsThis strain has a 100% Addiction rating, making it among the highest rated in the game. The downside is that the right ingredients take grinding before you can sell it.

The consistent customer demand provides a secure source of income, and it can be a substitute for the premium-grade ingredients if you’re running low.$140–$160 per unitThis strain is a reliable option—not the most eye-catching or the most costly, but it provides consistent sales at little cost of concern.

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

How Apple has scored a ‘win’ against UK’s security backdoor demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-apple-has-scored-a-win-against-uks-security-backdoor-demands/articleshow/120069708.cms,"Apple dropped Advanced Data Protection feature for users in the UK

In a notable ruling, the UK government has been unsuccessful in its bid to conceal the details of the UK government has failed in its attempt to keep secret the details of a surveillance order it issued against tech giant Apple. This ruling effectively grants Apple a victory in the legal battle where it was reportedly ordered to create a ""backdoor"" into its products.A newly-released decision by the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) reveals that parts of the legal case will now be heard in public. The IPT, a court that examines the exercise of surveillance powers, published its decision.“We do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,” said Judges Rabinder Singh and Jeremy Johnson, as per news agency Reuters.While the full specifics are still undisclosed, reports suggest the case centers around a UK legal demand compelling Apple to grant UK authorities access to the encrypted cloud data of any Apple customer globally.These “bare details” align with previously leaked information published by The Washington Post in February, which exposed the UK's alleged pursuit of a backdoor into Apple's systems.Following the emergence of these reports, Apple announced it could “no longer” offer its Advanced Data Protection feature to users in the UK. This feature provides end-to-end encryption for user files stored in Apple's cloud, ensuring that only the user can access them.It is understood that Apple challenged the surveillance order by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In response, the UK government argued before the court that making the nature of the case public would jeopardise national security.However, the IPT rejected this argument, siding with calls for greater transparency from various quarters.","The UK government has been unsuccessful in its bid to conceal the details of a surveillance order it issued against tech giant Apple.

Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kayla-nicole-and-the-gold-digger-myth-debunking-outdated-stereotypes-about-women-dating-athletes/articleshow/120067481.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Why successful women like Kayla Nicole are still targeted by misogynistic stereotypes

Kayla Nicole speaks out on reclaiming her narrative and self-worth

Kayla Nicole , a model, influencer, and sports journalist, has often found herself the subject of harsh public scrutiny due to her past relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce . Despite her own career achievements and independent success, Nicole has repeatedly been labeled with the “gold digger” tag — a damaging and outdated stereotype frequently applied to women who date high-profile athletes.Kayla Nicole, who boasts a degree in broadcast journalism and a portfolio of brand partnerships and hosting gigs, has never been financially dependent on a partner. Yet, public perception frequently reduces women like her to one-dimensional caricatures — suggesting that their proximity to fame must be motivated by money.These harmful narratives reflect a deeper societal discomfort with women who date within elite social circles. Instead of celebrating ambition, intelligence, or compatibility, people often question a woman’s intent. This is particularly true when race intersects with gender, as Black women are disproportionately labeled as opportunistic in the media.In recent interviews and social media posts, Nicole has been candid about how these stereotypes have affected her mental health and public image. She’s made it clear that she wants to be seen for more than her past relationship. “I am not defined by who I date,” Nicole has emphasized. Her transparency has resonated with many women navigating similar judgment in the spotlight or their personal lives.Nicole has also advocated for women to take control of their own narratives, emphasizing emotional wellness, financial independence, and self-love. Through her platform, she’s helping to challenge the double standards often placed on women in high-profile relationships.The assumption that women are only with athletes for fame or money diminishes their identities and achievements. It’s time to shift that conversation and recognize the autonomy, goals, and capabilities of women like Kayla Nicole.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s Coachella clip resurfaces, sparks fan frenzy Dating an athlete doesn’t define a woman’s worth — and it certainly doesn’t make her a “gold digger.” Society must evolve beyond these tired stereotypes and make space for women to be seen in their full complexity.","Kayla Nicole, a model, influencer, and sports journalist, has often found herself the subject of harsh public scrutiny due to her past relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce.

“THE BEST SONG”: Swifties are determined that Taylor Swift’s fan-favorite song ‘Fresh Out the Slammer’ might be her next single,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-best-song-swifties-are-determined-that-taylor-swifts-fan-favorite-song-fresh-out-the-slammer-might-be-her-next-single/articleshow/120066974.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Jack Antonoff's cryptic tweet stirs speculation about Taylor Swift's next single

The emotional resonance behind The Tortured Poets Department

As Taylor Swift enjoys a much-needed break from the spotlight following the end of her monumental Eras Tour , buzz around her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department , is far from slowing down. With fans still unpacking its layered lyrics and sonic depth, Swift’s longtime collaborator and producer Jack Antonoff just reignited speculation about which track might be crowned the next single—and all signs point to “Fresh Out the Slammer.”On April 5, Jack Antonoff tweeted, “into the fresh out the slammer thing that is my favorite on the album.” The seemingly casual comment, which quickly went viral, amassed over 40,000 likes on X (formerly Twitter). While he didn’t confirm anything outright, Swifties were quick to connect the dots, believing this was a subtle nudge that “Fresh Out the Slammer” could be next in line after “Fortnight” and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.”Fans responded with enthusiasm, urging Antonoff to push for a music video or official release. One fan wrote, “Jack please tell Taylor that we want it to be a single,” while another said, “THE BEST SONG IS FINALLY GETTING THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVES!!” One particularly observant user added, “he said the same thing ab august and then it became a sessional hit.. HOLD.” One woman posted, ""This is cryptically suspicious. Jack, do you have something you’d like to share with the class? Like maybe a MV for the song?”Even without Grammy recognition, The Tortured Poets Department has been a commercial and cultural juggernaut. The album made history by spending 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard charts within a single calendar year and set multiple streaming records. More than just numbers, the album resonated with listeners for its emotional intensity and introspection—qualities Antonoff himself highlighted in an interview with TIME.“Every album we’ve done together, I’ve learned so much. [‘TTPD’], to me, was just the ultimate,” he said. “It vacillates so much emotionally that I felt like it was truly what it’s like to be alive right now... It was a whirlwind to make it. I love it so much for that reason.”“Fresh Out the Slammer” stands out as a haunting yet liberating track that many believe reflects Swift’s emotional release following public scrutiny and past heartbreaks. With Antonoff calling it his favorite, and fan momentum building, a potential release as a single—complete with a visual narrative—could keep the TTPD era burning even brighter.Also Read: Taylor Swift joins billionaires’ club in 2025 alongside Hollywood heavyweights like Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey Only time will tell if Antonoff’s tweet was a personal reflection or an Easter egg.
