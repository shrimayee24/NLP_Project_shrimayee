In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow.

The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

K-dramas are more than just addictive storylines, they are visual masterpieces that shape global fashion, photography, and lifestyle trends. Male leads, whether it’s Vincenzo’s sharp-suited mafia lawyer or the gritty survivors of Squid Game, embody style, emotion, and cinematic presence. What makes them unforgettable isn’t only their outfits but also the way they own each scene, rain-drenched confrontations, snowy night walks, or quiet moments in cafés. With the right Gemini prompts, you can recreate this K-drama magic in your own photos. Below are 10 carefully designed prompts to help boys style their pictures like true K-drama heroes.“Man in a perfectly tailored Italian-style black suit, standing confidently under city skyscrapers at dusk, cinematic lighting, moody atmosphere, sharp details like polished shoes and gold watch, K-drama hero energy.”This look channels Vincenzo Cassano’s mafia lawyer vibe—sleek, confident, and intimidating. To make it work, go for a slim-fit black suit with minimal accessories. Pose with a strong stance, shoulders back, and eyes slightly narrowed to show authority. A backdrop with skyscrapers or glass buildings enhances the powerful city hero mood.“Young man in a military jacket, standing in the rain under streetlights, droplets visible on hair and jacket, determined expression, cinematic K-drama rain scene vibe.”Rain scenes in K-dramas often symbolise emotional turning points. To recreate this, use a dimly lit street or open area and let water droplets naturally fall on your hair and clothes. Keep your expression focused—half vulnerable, half determined—to reflect inner strength. Lighting should highlight the rain for extra drama.“Man wearing a green tracksuit with white stripes, standing in a gritty playground arena, serious expression, dramatic shadows, cinematic survival vibe.”This look is about raw survival and determination. The tracksuit is key—it represents struggle and resilience. Pair it with a tense body posture, like slightly hunched shoulders or clenched fists. Shooting in an empty playground, abandoned space, or gritty street corner will heighten the effect of a high-stakes moment.“Boy in casual pastel hoodie and white sneakers, sitting on university steps with books beside him, soft morning light, gentle smile, K-drama romantic lead aura.”This style captures the sweet, approachable vibe of a student lead. Use pastel-coloured hoodies, simple jeans, and sneakers. Pose casually—leaning on steps or sitting cross-legged—to appear natural and relaxed. Soft morning light adds innocence, while a gentle smile completes the warm, boy-next-door aesthetic.“Man with buzzcut hairstyle, sitting on a dimly lit rooftop overlooking neon-lit city streets, wearing casual jacket, pensive expression, deep K-drama mood.”Rooftops often symbolise solitude and resilience in K-dramas. Keep the styling simple—neutral jackets or sweaters—and use the neon cityscape in the background. Sit or lean with a thoughtful expression, as if lost in deep reflection. This creates an introspective, cinematic atmosphere.“Young man in leather jacket, leaning against a motorbike under streetlights, rebellious smirk, smoky night background, cinematic teen K-drama rebel look.”This is the ultimate bad-boy look. A leather jacket is essential, paired with dark jeans or boots. The pose should be relaxed yet confident, crossed arms or leaning casually. Add a smirk to convey playful rebellion. Night shots with smoke or blurred lights will amplify the rebellious mood.“Man in long wool coat and scarf, walking through snowy streets at night, soft golden lamplight, warm and emotional K-drama winter romance aesthetic.”Nothing says K-drama romance like snowy streets. Choose a thick wool coat, neutral tones, and a cosy scarf. Walk naturally while the camera captures motion, making the scene look effortless. Street lamps or fairy lights will add that magical, heartwarming winter glow.“Sharp-dressed man in modern business suit, seated in a luxury office chair with city skyline in background, confident pose, K-drama corporate romance style.”This look is all about power and elegance. Opt for a modern grey or navy suit with a tie. Sit with legs crossed or lean slightly forward with an intense gaze. A glass office backdrop with the city skyline makes the shot look polished and professional, perfect for a corporate romance vibe.“Man in casual black t-shirt and leather jacket, running through dimly lit alley with blurred motion, tense expression, cinematic thriller vibe.”Inspired by action-heavy dramas, this prompt works best with a darker setting. A leather jacket layered over casual wear creates a rugged look. Capture motion blur while running or looking back over your shoulder to add suspense. Keep your expression intense and focused to channel the hero-on-the-run energy.“Man in simple sweater, sitting alone by a window with a coffee cup, natural light falling on face, contemplative expression, soft K-drama slice-of-life mood.”For a softer, reflective mood, keep styling minimal, plain sweaters, muted colours, and natural light. Sit by a café window with a coffee or book, gazing thoughtfully outside. The expression should be calm, almost melancholic, showing emotional depth. This captures the quiet storytelling charm of slice-of-life dramas.K-drama heroes captivate audiences not just with dialogue but with how their scenes look, stylish, emotional, and cinematic. By using these Gemini prompts, you can style your photos to reflect those same moods. From powerful CEO vibes to snowy romance or gritty survival, each look tells its own story. Experiment with different lighting, backdrops, and expressions until you find the vibe that feels most like your own K-drama moment. With the right combination, your photos won’t just be pictures—they’ll be scenes from your own drama. Adding props, subtle colour grading, and dynamic poses can enhance the cinematic feel even further. Try incorporating movement, such as walking shots or wind effects, to add depth and authenticity. These small touches can make your images feel straight out of a high-budget drama.","K-dramas are visual masterpieces that shape global fashion, photography, and lifestyle trends.

Rome's airport opens luxurious dog hotel with pampering services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/romes-airport-opens-luxurious-dog-hotel-with-pampering-services/articleshow/124033139.cms,"A dog named Zoe, runs out from one of the rooms of the Dog Relais, a hotel for dogs at Rome's Fiumicino International Airport (AP photo)





FIUMICINO: Dog owners often face a dilemma before traveling: leave your beloved pet with a sitter or at a kennel? Both require quite some planning and logistics, which can be stressful and time-consuming for fur parents.Rome's Fiumicino International Airport has sought to streamline the process by opening one of the first on-site hotels at a major European airport, following a similar initiative in Frankfurt. Dog Relais' workers even retrieve pups from the terminal so travelers can proceed straight to their flight.""This project is fitting into a strategy to provide a very immersive experience to passengers,"" said Marilena Blasi, chief commercial officer at Aeroporti di Roma, the company that manages Italian capital's two airports. ""In this case, we provide services to dogs and the owners of the dogs.""Basic rooms at the dog hotel cost about €40 ($47) and feature temperature-controlled floors and private gardens. More timid or solitary dogs can be placed in kennels at the edge of the facility, where they interact with staff rather than other dogs in the common grass pens. At night, ambient music that has a frequency with a low, soft tone - 432 hertz - designed for relaxation is piped in through the rooms' speakers.There are optional extras that range from the usual grooming, bathing and cleaning teeth services, to the more indulgent, such as aromatherapy with lavender or peppermint scents to help induce calm, or arnica cream rubbed into aching muscles and joints.Owners unsatisfied with standard-issue webcams for checking in on their canines from afar can spring for a €60 (about $70) premium room equipped with a screen for round-the-clock videocalls. They can even pamper their pet by tossing a treat via an application connected to a dispenser.The facility not only provides its services to travelers, but also to dog owners who need daycare.Working in human resources for Aeroporti di Roma, Alessandra Morelli regularly leaves her 2-year-old, chocolate-colored Labrador Retriever there.""Since I've been able to bring Nina to this dog hotel, my life, and the balance between my personal and professional life have changed because it allows me to enjoy my working day and my personal travels in total peace and tranquility,"" said Morelli, 47.Dario Chiassarini, 32, said he started bringing his Rottweiler puppy, Athena, to Dog Relais for training, another service on offer, because it's clean, well-organized and its location was easily accessible. And he said he plans to check his beloved pup into the hotel whenever he and his girlfriend need to travel.""We will rely on them without hesitation and without doubt - both because we got to know the people who work here, which for us is essential, and because of the love they have for animals and the peace of mind of knowing who we are entrusting Athena to,"" said Chiassarini, who works in car sales. ""It is certainly a service that, if we should need it, we will make use of.""The dog hotel has proved popular so far. All 40 rooms were occupied in August, when Italians take their customary summer vacation and millions of passengers come through Fiumicino. Occupancy averaged almost 2/3 since doors opened in May, said Blasi.The same month the dog hotel opened, Italy's commercial aviation authority changed rules to allow large dogs to fly inside plane cabins for domestic flights, provided they are inside secured crates. The first such flight will take off on Sept. 23, according to transport minister, Matteo Salvini.Salvini admits that while many are happy with having their pups on the plane, others may feel annoyed. However, at a pet conference on Sept. 16, he said: ""We always have to use judgment, but ... for me it's a source of pride, as well as a step forward from the point of view of civilization.""","Rome's Fiumicino International Airport has sought to streamline the process by opening one of the first on-site hotels at a major European airport. Dog Relais' workers even retrieve pups from the terminal so travelers can proceed straight to their flight. The facility not only provides its services to travelers, but also to dog owners who need daycare.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124033142,imgsize-531081,width-400,resizemode-4/article-44.jpg"

Why a UAE Licence matters









Getting a driving licence in the UAE is now easier and more accessible than ever, thanks to recent updates that allow 17-year-olds to apply for permits. Whether you’re planning to ride a motorcycle, drive a car, operate a heavy vehicle, or even become a bus driver, the process is clearly laid out, from eligibility and documents to theory lessons, practical training, tests, and costs. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide to everything you need to know about obtaining your driving licence in the UAE.The UAE issues licences based on vehicle type, with specific age thresholds for each category:Until 2025, applicants could only begin lessons at 17.5 years and had to wait until turning 18 to receive their licence. A new federal decree law passed in October 2024 lowered the minimum age to 17, making the UAE the first GCC country to introduce this change.This update aims to create a new generation of safe, responsible drivers by instilling road safety habits earlier and offering young residents greater independence and mobility.Anyone who is a UAE citizen or resident, of the legal minimum age, and medically fit can apply. Here’s what you’ll need to get started:Here’s how the process unfolds in most Emirates (small variations may apply):Depending on your emirate, you must register with an approved driving school.The total cost of obtaining a UAE driving licence generally falls between AED 4,500 and AED 7,000 (approximately $1,226–1,907), depending on the emirate and the driving school you choose. This amount typically covers theory and practical training fees, the mandatory eye test, as well as all test and licence issuance charges. Once you’ve applied, you can easily check the status of your licence online, Dubai residents can do so via the RTA Dubai website, while applicants in other emirates can use the Ministry of Interior, Abu Dhabi Police, or TAMM platforms.Even with Dubai’s robust public transport network, many residents rely on personal cars for daily commutes. A UAE licence is also essential for renting a car, handy for those who don’t own one.The streamlined process, early eligibility, and rigorous testing ensure that drivers are well-prepared for the road — helping maintain safety standards across the country.","Driving without a licence in the UAE attracts heavy fines, so complete the process fully before getting behind the wheel.

UAE–Nvidia AI and robotics lab: Operational structure, rollout and future expansion









Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has partnered with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to establish the Middle East’s first joint AI research facility. This strategic collaboration marks a significant milestone in the UAE’s growing efforts to become a global force in artificial intelligence and robotics innovation.The newly launched joint research lab, officially called the TII–Nvidia AI Technology Centre (NVAITC), is located in Abu Dhabi and represents the first of its kind in the Middle East. This collaboration brings together TII’s multidisciplinary research expertise in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous systems, and high-performance computing, with Nvidia’s advanced AI models and accelerated computing platforms.According to TII CEO Dr. Najwa Aaraj, the lab will focus on the development of next-generation AI models, humanoid technologies, robotics platforms, and intelligent systems capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.The partnership is designed to integrate advanced robotic platforms with cutting-edge AI tools, driving progress in areas such as:This lab also marks a pivotal shift in the region’s AI landscape as it’s the first time Nvidia’s NVAITC network is expanding into robotics in the Middle East.Carlo Ruiz, Nvidia's VP of Enterprise Solutions and Operations for EMEA, highlighted that the initiative aims to accelerate real-world breakthroughs in intelligent systems.A major highlight of the collaboration is the use of Nvidia’s Thor chip, a powerful edge GPU designed specifically for advanced robotic systems development. This chip, which TII will newly incorporate into its projects, is expected to play a crucial role in accelerating robotic innovation.TII is currently conducting R&D on a diverse portfolio of robotic systems, including:By leveraging the Thor chip and Nvidia’s computing infrastructure, TII aims to advance both the hardware and AI software integration of its robotic systems, with a focus on enabling these machines to reason, adapt, and act autonomously in real-time.Additionally, TII has already been using Nvidia’s chips to train its proprietary Falcon large language model (LLM) family, which is part of the UAE’s broader efforts to build national AI capabilities.This lab launch fits into the UAE’s long-term vision to become a global hub for artificial intelligence and advanced technologies. The country’s AI strategy is structured around several national frameworks:Earlier in 2025, the UAE and U.S. governments signed the AI Acceleration Partnership, reinforcing cooperation on critical technologies and announcing a joint initiative for a 5-gigawatt UAE–US AI Campus.This broader geopolitical backdrop also included a multi-billion-dollar agreement — signed during former U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Gulf in May — to build one of the world’s largest data centre hubs in Abu Dhabi, powered by U.S. technologies and advanced Nvidia chips. However, the finalisation of this deal has faced delays, reportedly due to security concerns related to the UAE’s ties with China.Discussions to establish the joint lab began approximately a year ago. Now operational, the facility will be staffed by a dedicated team comprising experts from both TII and Nvidia. Additional hiring is underway to expand the project-specific workforce and support the lab's ongoing research objectives.The lab will serve as a central node in Nvidia’s global NVAITC network, and a regional hub for applied research, particularly in real-world AI and robotics deployments. It aims to not only support innovation but also contribute directly to the development of intelligent machines and systems with high levels of autonomy and functional complexity.","Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has partnered with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to establish the Middle East’s first joint AI research facility.

Nature can be strange, surprising, and downright unbelievable. From showers of fish and frogs to blood-red rain and snow in the Sahara, the world has witnessed phenomena that seem straight out of a fantasy. Rare lightning orbs, frost flowers in polar seas, and even fire rainbows paint a vivid picture of how extraordinary weather and environmental events can be.These astonishing events are not just curiosities—they reveal the incredible power of nature, from violent storms and volcanic eruptions to microscopic spores and ice crystals. Across continents and oceans, humans have stared in awe as the impossible unfolds above, below, and all around them.In the small town of Yoro, Honduras, residents witness an astonishing event almost every year called Lluvia de Peces (“Rain of Fish”). During heavy storms, strong winds or waterspouts lift fish from nearby rivers or ponds, dropping them over streets and fields. Locals often collect the fish afterward, calling it a blessing. While anecdotal, scientists suggest that tornado-like wind systems during intense storms can carry fish over short distances, creating the seemingly impossible spectacle.This unique phenomenon has been reported for decades, often in late spring and summer when storms are strongest.Though the Sahara Desert is famed for its scorching sands, rare snowfalls have been recorded in 1979, 2016, and 2018. Cold air from northern regions combines with local atmospheric moisture, leading to brief snow showers over sand dunes. Temperatures can drop dramatically overnight, allowing snow to settle on the golden dunes, creating a surreal white-on-gold landscape. These snow events are short-lived, often melting within hours under the desert sun, but they captivate observers worldwide.After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, survivors reported black rain falling over the devastated city. The soot-laden precipitation formed as radioactive dust and debris mixed with atmospheric moisture. This rain caused further contamination and injuries, darkening streets and clothes. Documented extensively by historians and scientists, it is a tragic example of how human-made disasters can produce extraordinary natural effects, where precipitation carries harmful particles, creating both visual and lethal consequences for affected populations. Black rain continued in pockets for several days after the blast.During eruptions at Japan’s Mount Sakurajima and other volcanoes, lightning has been observed striking within volcanic ash clouds. The phenomenon occurs as friction between ash particles creates static electricity, igniting bolts in the thick, smoke-filled sky. Photographers have captured these electric displays erupting alongside fiery lava and dense volcanic plumes, producing a spectacular mix of natural fire and electricity.In Kerala in 2001, residents observed rainfall that appeared blood-red. Scientific analysis revealed that the red particles were spores from local algae. Heavy showers carried these spores from rivers or ponds, giving the rain its dramatic crimson hue. The unusual downpour drew global attention, sparking curiosity and myths about extraterrestrial origins. This phenomenon lasted several weeks, mostly in July and August, during the monsoon season. It remains a well-documented natural event that illustrates how microscopic biological particles can dramatically alter the colour of rainwater, creating a striking, surreal visual effect.Ball lightning is an extremely rare phenomenon where glowing, spherical orbs of electricity appear during thunderstorms, moving unpredictably and sometimes entering buildings before vanishing. Scientists still debate the exact causes, but the balls are thought to form from high-voltage electrical discharges combined with atmospheric moisture. Reports exist across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Witnesses often describe them hovering, bouncing, or rolling across floors, radiating bright, bluish-white light.In 2005, a small Serbian town reported frogs falling from the sky during a torrential downpour. Meteorologists explained that strong winds, updrafts, or waterspouts likely lifted the amphibians from nearby ponds or rivers, carrying them several kilometres before depositing them onto streets and gardens. Residents were startled by the hopping creatures showering down with rain. Similar events have occurred in the United States and Europe.Across the US, tornadoes have occasionally been documented lifting fish from lakes and ponds, depositing them miles away in fields or towns. During intense twisters, the swirling winds can carry lightweight aquatic animals, creating the bizarre phenomenon of raining fish. Meteorological folklore records multiple such instances, especially in states like Florida and Louisiana, where waterspouts form over lakes or coastal waters.Frost flowers are delicate ice crystals that form on sea ice or polar regions under extreme cold and calm conditions. They grow when supercooled water vapor rises and freezes on the surface of newly formed ice, creating intricate, flower-like structures. Observed in the Arctic, Antarctic, and polar seabeds, these frost flowers reflect light, often sparkling in the low sun. They play a role in releasing salts and trace chemicals into the atmosphere and marine ecosystems.Fire rainbows, or circumhorizontal arcs, occur when sunlight passes through ice crystals in high-altitude cirrus clouds at a specific angle, creating rainbow-like streaks in the sky. They are extremely rare and require precise conditions, often appearing during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike normal rainbows, they are horizontal and have vivid, flame-like colours. Fire rainbows have been spotted in the US, Europe, and Asia, often photographed by skywatchers.","In Honduras, strong winds or waterspouts lift fish from nearby rivers or ponds, dropping them over streets and fields.

To reduce administrative delays and prevent duplicate applications, Kuwait ’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a new visa pre-verification feature for domestic workers (Visa 20) via the Sahel app. The move is part of a broader push to digitize services, enhance transparency, and streamline regulatory compliance in labor and immigration processes.The Ministry of Interior recently launched a new tool on the unified Sahel application, enabling users to verify whether a visa has already been issued for a particular domestic worker before they proceed with recruitment. This is aimed at avoiding common errors such as duplicate applications, which often result in delays or outright rejections.The feature focuses specifically on the Visa 20 category, which applies to foreign nationals working as domestic staff — including maids, drivers, and household helpers, under the sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen or resident.By making this verification step available through Sahel, the Ministry aims to:This marks a step forward in Kuwait’s efforts to introduce tech-driven improvements in a sector that remains both sensitive and complex, particularly in terms of labor rights and regulatory oversight.The Domestic Worker Visa (Visa 20) is the standard visa used by Kuwaiti households to hire full-time domestic staff. Designed for roles such as maids, drivers, and nannies, this visa category is structured to support households that require assistance with day-to-day domestic work.To apply for this visa, sponsors are required to submit a comprehensive set of documents:This visa is considered the preferred legal route for Kuwaitis and residents looking to hire household help from abroad. The newly added verification step on Sahel ensures that employers do not unknowingly begin the hiring process for workers who already have active visa entries, thus saving time and preventing legal complications.The Sahel App, first launched in 2021, is a mobile platform developed as part of Kuwait’s national digital transformation initiative. It allows citizens and residents to access a wide array of e-government services from multiple ministries and agencies, including:Services available on Sahel include:The app is designed for accessibility, available in both Arabic and English, with the English version launched in 2024 by the Minister of State for Communication Affairs, Omar Al-Omar. This bilingual approach broadens accessibility to the expatriate community and reflects Kuwait’s commitment to inclusive digital services.Additionally, the platform is built with high standards of data security and user authentication, ensuring that personal information remains protected while allowing for seamless, real-time interactions with government systems.Beyond the updates to Sahel and Visa 20 processes, other regulatory efforts are also underway across Kuwait:The Supreme Committee for the Investigation of Kuwaiti Citizenship, led by First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sheikh Fahad Al Yousef Saud Al Sabah, convened recently and disclosed a set of cases involving the revocation of Kuwaiti citizenship.Grounds for these actions included:The committee emphasized that all actions were taken in the “higher interest of the country” and confirmed that these cases would now be forwarded to the Kuwaiti Cabinet for final approval. Citizenship withdrawal remains a highly sensitive topic in Kuwait, often tied to discussions of national identity, legal rights, and political implications.Meanwhile, Kuwait Municipality is intensifying its inspection drives targeting businesses operating without valid advertising permits. During a recent field visit to a shopping mall in Hawally, inspection supervisor Bader Al Najdi reported:Offending outlets included those with:Al Najdi stated that inspectors are submitting monthly reports to the Financial Affairs Department, detailing violations, warnings, and fines collected. Businesses are being urged to strictly comply with municipal regulations, with Al Najdi affirming that inspection teams will maintain strict enforcement protocols to preserve public standards.","Kuwait ’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a new visa pre-verification feature for domestic workers (Visa 20) via the Sahel app. The move is part of a broader push to digitize services, enhance transparency, and streamline regulatory compliance in labor and immigration processes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124024412,imgsize-664893,width-400,resizemode-4/kuwait-sahel-app-domestic-worker-visa.jpg"

Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think





Oracle will implement significant modifications to TikTok’s algorithm following an anticipated executive order from President Donald Trump later this week, a White House official confirmed. Under the proposed agreement to transfer TikTok’s US operations to a consortium of American investors, Oracle will be tasked with developing and securing a US-specific version of the platform’s algorithm.According to a report by Bloomberg, the plan has been outlined by the official and it will ensure that the new US-based owners will control TikTok's recommendation software – which has been a complicating factor in any past deal.The official explained that the American buyers will lease a copy of the algorithm from TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and Oracle will then ""retrain"" it ""from the ground up.""The agreement also specifies that all data from US users will be stored in a secure cloud managed by Oracle. This system will include security controls designed to prevent access by foreign adversaries, including China. Crucially, ByteDance will have no access to US user data or control over the US algorithm, the report said.""Oracle, the US security partner, will operate, retrain, and continuously monitor the U.S. algorithm to ensure content is free from improper manipulation or surveillance,"" according to a Q&A document that accompanied the official's statement.The app’s algorithm has long been a key challenge in the deal, as US law prohibits ByteDance from having any operational role in a new US app, while Chinese law restricts the export of such sensitive technology.The White House official confirmed that Oracle will work in partnership with the US government on everything from algorithm retraining to application development and source code review. The specific extent of the government's oversight role, however, was not immediately clear.This news comes as President Donald Trump prepares to finalise a long-awaited plan to sell the video-sharing platform.","Oracle will be tasked with developing and securing a US-specific version of the platform’s algorithm.

Google Maps travel time accuracy: How exactly does it know the distance and time of your trip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-travel-time-accuracy-how-exactly-does-it-know-the-distance-and-time-of-your-trip/articleshow/124047092.cms,"How Google Maps calculates travel time exactly

Other factors that affect travel time

How accurate is it?

Why Google Maps is so reliable

Mapping distances and speed limits

Applying historical traffic patterns

Integrating real-time traffic updates

Using advanced routing algorithms

Considering transport mode, road type, and incidents

Continuously updating predictions dynamically





Have you ever marvelled at how Google Maps can tell you almost exactly how long your journey will take? It’s not magic; it is a combination of advanced technology, vast amounts of data, and clever algorithms. Google Maps doesn’t just measure the distance between two points. It considers speed limits, typical road speeds, and even the type of road you’re travelling on, whether a smooth highway or a busy city street. On top of that, it uses live traffic updates from millions of users, historical traffic patterns, and artificial intelligence predictions to give you highly accurate travel times. This dynamic system ensures that your estimated arrival time adjusts in real time if there is an accident, heavy traffic, or roadwork along the way.At its core, Google Maps measures the distance from your starting point to your destination using detailed digital maps. It then calculates travel time based on average speeds for each type of road. For example, highways generally allow higher speeds than local streets, so your journey is broken into segments with different speed estimates. The basic formula is simple:Travel Time = Distance ÷ Average SpeedHowever, the “average speed” is not fixed. It is refined using data from previous trips and real-time conditions to make predictions far more accurate than simply following speed limits.Google Maps has collected years of information on traffic patterns from past trips. By analysing when and where congestion usually occurs, the app can predict how fast traffic will move at a particular time of day or day of the week. This helps the system anticipate delays before they happen, giving you a realistic estimate rather than just a “distance divided by speed” calculation.One of the most powerful features of Google Maps is its ability to see live traffic conditions. Users’ smartphones with the app open anonymously send location and speed data. By analyzing this information, Google can detect traffic jams, accidents, or road closures and instantly adjust your route and travel time. This is why your arrival time can change while you are already on the road.Finding the fastest route is not as simple as choosing the shortest path. Google Maps uses advanced algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm and A search* to evaluate millions of possible routes. These algorithms consider distance, speed, traffic, road types, and other factors to determine the quickest path. The system also constantly re-evaluates your route based on new traffic data.Google Maps considers many additional factors to improve accuracy:Mode of transport: Walking, biking, driving, or public transit each have unique speed and route characteristics.Road types: Highways, main streets, and side roads all have different average speeds.Traffic incidents: Accidents, roadwork, or closures are factored in real time.Machine learning predictions: Google predicts future traffic patterns using AI, considering weather, events, and historical trends.Google Maps is impressively accurate. Studies and user experiences show that its travel time estimates often differ by only 1–2 minutes on average for normal trips. Accuracy may vary during extreme traffic or unpredictable events, but the app quickly adjusts estimates as conditions change.The key to Google Maps’ reliability is its layered approach:This combination of technology, live data, and machine learning ensures that Google Maps can give you travel times that are both accurate and adaptive, making commuting and long trips easier to plan than ever before.",Google Maps measures the distance from your starting point to your destination using detailed digital maps.

H-1B visa fee hike: Why internet is blaming MBA chai wala as ‘culprit’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/h-1b-visa-fee-hike-why-internet-is-blaming-mba-chai-wala-as-culprit/articleshow/124044868.cms,"Social media humorously connect Prafull Billore’s US visit to H-1B visa fee hike

Prafull Billore MBA Chai wala’s ‘panauti’ tag





H-1B visa has become costlier after Trump introduced a $100,000 annual fee on future applications. The new prices have come into effect starting today, September 21, leaving many guessing with what happens next. Amid the chaos, entrepreneur Prafull Billore, popularly known as MBA Chai Wala has become subject of online jokes after his recent trip to the United States coincided with the announcement of steep H-1B visa fee hike.Billore shared a photo on September 8 from outside Google ’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. He then captioned the post “Hello from Google’s headquarters, Googleplex, Mountain View, California, United States.”Days after, US President Donald Trump signed an order imposing a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications on September 19. The move sparked anxiety among Indian tech workers and companies that accounted for the majority of H-1B visa holders.On microblogging platforms X (formerly twitter), users humorously connected Billore’s visit with the visa decision, reviving the “panauti” label he has carried for more than a year.“This caused H1B Visa Crisis. He is having 100% strike rate,” one user wrote on X. Another quipped: “Now we know the culprit behind H1B woes. Panauti bhai at his best.”“Bhai ka track record ek dum bana hua hai… H1B visa ki fees badh hi gayi hai and poora Silicon Valley industry H1B visa par hi establish hai (Brother’s track record is perfect… H1B visa fees have increased and the entire Silicon Valley industry relies on H1B visas),” joked another.The “panauti” tag first emerged in June 2024 when Billore posted a selfie with cricketer Suryakumar Yadav. The following day, Yadav scored only six runs in a T20 match, prompting a flood of memes. Since then, the label has stuck, with Billore often playing along and even launching a “Reverse Panauti” campaign to turn the joke into a branding tool.Billore, who rose to prominence with his tea startup before becoming a social media figure, has not publicly responded to the latest round of memes.","Prafull Billore, popularly known as MBA Chai Wala, has become subject of online jokes.
