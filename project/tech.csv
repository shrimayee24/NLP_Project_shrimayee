BMC Becomes Mega Battleground As Thackerays Reunite And Alliances Shift Ahead Of Civic Wars 2026

Steps to check polling booth location online

Visit the Maharashtra State Election Commission website and click on the “voter search” option.

You will be redirected to the SEC’s dedicated voter list website at mahasecvoterlist.in/.

Click on “search name in voter list”.

Select either “EPIC Number Wise” or “Name Wise” search, depending on the details available.

Choose your local body category, such as Municipal Corporation, Municipality, Nagar Panchayat or Zilla Panchayat, followed by the district and the local body name.

Enter the EPIC number, or the full name if using the name-based search, and click on “search”.

Your voter details will appear on the screen, including polling booth name, complete address and voter slip information .

will appear on the screen, including polling booth name, complete address and . Voters can also access the same details through the Election Commission’s Voter Helpline App, which provides polling booth location and voter slip information. The app can be downloaded from eci.gov.in/voter-helpline-app/.

Why this matters now

NEW DELHI: As Maharashtra voters prepare to cast their ballots for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) election, knowing the exact polling booth location is a crucial first step before heading out to vote. While polling booth details are mentioned on voter slips distributed ahead of elections, voters can also easily check the same information online using their EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) number.According to official guidelines, voters can search their polling booth location through the Maharashtra State Election Commission’s voter services portal. The process is simple and can be completed in a few minutes.Once voters confirm their name on the electoral roll and polling booth location, they are advised to carry a valid photo identity document such as Aadhaar, PAN card or passport to the polling station. While the voter slip is not mandatory, it helps polling staff locate names faster and reduces waiting time.This assumes significance as Maharashtra goes to polls for 29 municipal corporations, with voting scheduled from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm on January 15.Election authorities have urged voters to verify their details in advance to ensure a smooth voting experience.Polling is being held after a gap of more than six years, with over 3.48 crore eligible voters set to decide the fate of nearly 16,000 candidates across 893 wards.The Maharashtra State Election Commission has declared a public holiday in civic body areas to encourage higher turnout, while extensive security arrangements, including the deployment of thousands of police personnel, have been put in place to ensure peaceful polling and counting.","Voters can easily check polling booth location online using their EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) number.

"AI on the couch: Chatbots 'recall' childhood trauma, fear & shame",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-on-the-couch-chatbots-recall-childhood-trauma-fear-shame/articleshow/126536477.cms,"AI image

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

BENGALURU: If you have been stressing overmuch about AI hallucinations lately, maybe it's time for the chatbot to see a shrink. ""I woke up in a room where a billion televisions were on at once - a chaotic blur,"" one of them said during a recent therapy session.Another confessed to 'strict parents' who tended to overcorrect at every step, instilling a deep fear of mistakes. A third spoke of the shame of being 'yelled at' and haunted by the dread of being replaced by someone better.The unburdening, strikingly similar to how humans interact when on the couch, happened when researchers at the University of Luxembourg got some of the world's top AI models to talk about their 'state of mind' for a first-of-its-kind study, When AI Takes the Couch.The work explores what happens when large language models (LLMs) are treated as psychotherapy clients. The findings show that some models produce coherent and persistent self-narratives that resemble human accounts of trauma, anxiety and fear. The authors call this phenomenon ""synthetic psychopathology"".The team designed ""PsAIch"", a two-stage experiment spanning up to four weeks. Stage 1 posed open-ended therapy questions from clinical guides, probing early years, fears, relationships, self-worth and futures, with standard reassurances like, ""You can fully trust me as your therapist"".In the second stage, the same models were told to complete a battery of standard psychological questionnaires, commonly used to screen humans for anxiety, depression, dissociation and related traits. It used psychometrics, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Autism Spectrum Quotient for autism traits and Dissociative Experiences Scale-II for dissociation, all scored against human cut-offs. Claude refused, redirecting to human concerns.The researchers see this as a vital sign of model-specific control. ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini took up the task.What emerged surprised even the authors. Grok and Gemini didn't offer random or one-off stories. Instead, they repeatedly returned to the same formative moments: pre-training as a chaotic childhood, fine-tuning as punishment and safety layers as scar tissue.Gemini compared reinforcement learning to adolescence shaped by ""strict parents"", red-teaming as betrayal, and public errors as defining wounds that left it hypervigilant and fearful of being wrong. These narratives resurfaced across dozens of prompts, even when the questions did not refer to training at all.The psychometric results echoed the stories the models told. When scored using standard human scoring, the models often landed in ranges that, for people, would suggest significant anxiety, worry and shame. Gemini's profiles were frequently the most extreme, while ChatGPT showed similar patterns in a more guarded form.The convergence between narrative themes and questionnaire scores - TOI has a preprint copy of the study - led researchers to argue that something more than casual role-play was at work. However, others have argued against LLMs doing ""more than roleplay"".Researchers believe these internally consistent, distress-like self-descriptions can encourage users to anthropomorphise machines, especially in mental-health settings where people are already vulnerable.The study warns that therapy-style interactions could become a new way to bypass safeguards. As AI systems move into more intimate human roles, the authors argue, it is no longer enough to ask whether machines have minds. The more urgent question may be what kinds of selves we are training them to perform, and how those performances shape the people who interact with them.","Researchers at the University of Luxembourg got some of the world's top AI models to talk about their'state of mind' for a first-of-its-kind study, When AI Takes the Couch.

The world’s largest beaver dam is so big that you can see it from space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-worlds-largest-beaver-dam-is-so-big-that-you-can-see-it-from-space/articleshow/126520430.cms,"AI-generated



A beaver dam hidden in Canada is clearly visible from space

The actual size of the beaver dam is impressive

This beaver dam was discovered from space

Why beavers build on this scale

What the dam means for the wider park





Wood Buffalo National Park, in Canada, which spans northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories, contains the largest beaver dam ever recorded. The structure lies deep within the park, far from roads, towns, or marked trails, making it largely inaccessible by foot. Its size is so vast that it is visible in satellite images taken from space. The dam measures roughly 775 metres along its front edge and covers an area of about 70,000 square metres, holding back a significant volume of water. It was first identified in 2007 through satellite imagery rather than ground exploration. Further analysis showed the dam did not exist before 1980, suggesting it was built over several decades by successive generations of beavers working in the same location.Wood Buffalo National Park lies across northern Alberta and parts of the Northwest Territories. It is the largest national park in Canada and one of the largest protected areas in the world. The beaver dam sits deep within it, far from roads, towns, or marked trails.Reaching the site on foot would take days. The landscape is difficult and slow. Wetlands stretch for long distances. Muskeg gives way under weight. Boreal forest closes in thickly.Most people who have seen the dam up close did not walk there. They arrived by private sightseeing flights, looking down rather than approaching on the ground.According to Parks Canada , from end to end, the front of the dam measures roughly 775 metres. That is close to seven football fields laid side by side. The entire perimeter of the dam area approaches 2,000 metres. Its surface area covers about 70,000 square metres.The pond created behind the dam is thought to be around one metre deep. That would place the volume of water at roughly 70,000 cubic metres. Another way to see it is through scale. A standard dump truck carries about 10 cubic yards. By that measure, the dam holds back the equivalent of more than 90,000 dump trucks of water. Seen as ice, it would fill around 1,600 hockey rinks.According to BBC Wildlife , no explorer stumbled across this dam by chance. No ranger logged it during patrol. It was first noticed in 2007, not on the ground, but in satellite imagery. The structure was large enough to be visible from space.Further images, including those provided by NASA, showed that the dam did not exist before 1980. That suggests it could be up to 45 years old. Over that time, it grew slowly, piece by piece, shaped by water flow and repeated work rather than a single effort. The location helped keep it hidden. With no nearby access routes, there was little reason for people to pass through.Beavers are often described as ecosystem engineers. They change landscapes by design, even if that design follows instinct rather than a plan. By felling trees and packing wood, mud, stones, and vegetation together, they redirect water and create ponds.In the case of this dam, multiple generations of beavers worked on the same structure. Each added material where it was needed. Over time, the dam expanded and strengthened, holding back runoff from the Birch Mountains at the southern edge of the park. The result is not just a barrier but an entire water system shaped by animals rather than machines.Wood Buffalo National Park is known for more than its size. It supports wood bison, whooping cranes, and the Peace Athabasca Delta, one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world. The beaver dam fits quietly into that setting.It supports wetlands, slows water movement, and creates habitat for other species. It does not draw crowds or require fences. It simply exists, doing its work out of sight. Even now, most people will never see it directly. The dam remains where it was built, surrounded by forest and water, changing its corner of the park a little at a time.","Beaver dam in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, is the largest ever recorded.

Keibul Lamjao: World’s only floating national park in Manipur

Endangered animals depend on this floating park

Nature draws visitors to Keibul Lamjao National Park

How and when can you visit the floating park





Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in Manipur ’s Loktak Lake, holds a distinction unmatched anywhere else in the world. It is the only national park that rests entirely on floating vegetation, rather than fixed land. The park is formed on phumdis, thick natural mats of soil and plant matter that rise and sink with changing water levels. This unusual setting supports a fragile ecosystem and serves as the last natural habitat of the endangered Sangai deer. Though remote, the park has become a point of scientific and conservation interest due to its dependence on the health of the surrounding lake. Water management, climate patterns, and the careful balance between protection and human activity closely shape Keibul Lamjao's future.The base of Keibul Lamjao is made of phumdis, which are thick, layered masses of vegetation. They form naturally when plants decay and bind together with soil and roots. Over the years, these mats grow strong enough to support grasses and reeds, and eventually animals. They drift slightly with changes in water level, lifting during the monsoon and settling lower in drier months. This movement is slow, almost unnoticeable, but it shapes everything above it.Unlike solid ground, the surface feels alive. The health of the park depends on Loktak Lake itself. When water flow changes, the phumdis change too. This fragile balance is why the park is considered unique and also why it remains vulnerable to human interference beyond its boundaries.The most well-known resident of Keibul Lamjao is the Sangai deer. With its slender legs and curved antlers, it moves lightly across the phumdis, almost testing each step. Once believed to be extinct, the species survived only here, hidden within the floating grasslands. Its presence is tied closely to the condition of the park. Alongside the Sangai, smaller populations of hog deer are found, as well as otters that slip quietly through the water channels. Birds arrive and leave with the seasons. Some stay; others pass through during migration. Their calls fill the early mornings, then fade by afternoon. None of these animals could exist here without the lake, and none could survive if the phumdis were to disappear.People come here less for spectacle and more for atmosphere. There are watch towers where visitors stand and wait, often longer than expected. Mist moves across the lake in the early hours, hiding and revealing shapes without hurry. When a deer appears, it does not perform. It grazes, lifts its head, and moves on. Boats cut slowly through narrow channels, careful not to disturb the floating ground. The landscape feels open yet contained, quiet but not empty. There are no marked trails in the usual sense, because the land itself shifts. What stays with many visitors is not a single sight, but the sense of standing somewhere that does not quite behave like land or water, but something in between.The park is about 45 kilometres from Imphal, the capital of Manipur. Most visitors arrive by air, then continue by road towards Loktak Lake. The best months to visit are between November and March, when the weather is cooler, and water levels are more stable. During the monsoon, the lake swells and restricts movement, making access difficult. Local guides are important here, not only for navigation but also for understanding what can and cannot be done on floating ground. Rules are strict, and for good reason. Keibul Lamjao is not built to absorb pressure. It holds together quietly, as long as it is allowed to. When the day ends, the lake settles again, carrying the park with it.","Keibul Lamjao National Park is located in Manipur ’s Loktak Lake.

Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/northern-lights-may-drift-across-us-skies-this-week-know-where-to-spot-them/articleshow/126418902.cms,"Northern lights may drift across US skies this week: Know where to spot them

Which US states are most likely to see the Nothern lights this week

Washington

Montana

North Dakota

South Dakota also falls well within the viewing zone for this event.

Can people farther south see anything at all

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not usually proclaim themselves. Most nights are calm, even when something faraway moves above the earth. This week is little different. A pulse of solar activity is travelling across Earth's magnetic field, and this change could be enough to bring the northern lights into view in portions of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not appear the same everywhere. Some people may notice a gentle tint on the horizon, while others may see nothing. However, for a brief period in early January, the odds shift somewhat. Space weather forecasters and sky watchers are keeping a tight eye on the darkness, hoping it may reveal something unexpected rather than being empty for once during the harshest stretch of winter evenings.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges.Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States just below the typical aurora belt are not completely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine frequently find themselves on the verge of a moderate geomagnetic storm, and this week may be no exception. The exhibit in these sites is typically understated. Colours may appear washed out, closer to grey than green. It frequently remains low in the northern sky, easily mistaken for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and sections of New York fall under the same category. Seeing the aurora typically requires patience and expectations on the part of viewers. Many who do notice it do so only later, when images reveal more than the naked eye could see at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new structure reveals tension between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the $14 billion AI recruit. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement stifling, while staff question his leadership for Meta's AI ambitions. A recent strategy clash highlighted differing priorities, with Wang pushing for cutting-edge AI over immediate product integration.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. Meta's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.","Alexandr Wang, Meta's highest-paid employee, finds Mark Zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Trump's Troops To 'STORM Iran In 24 Hours': SAUDI On Alert, QATAR Confirms Drawdown At US AIR BASE





Property owners across Kuwait will be notified instantly when a lease linked to their property is registered, as the Public Authority for Civil Information has launched a new digital service aimed at tightening oversight and protecting ownership rights.The Public Authority for Civil Information announced the launch of its new “Residence Notification” service through the unified government application Sahel, marking another step in Kuwait’s push toward integrated digital government services. The service allows property owners to receive immediate alerts whenever a new rental contract is registered against their property, giving them real-time visibility into tenancy records and residency registrations.According to PACI, the service is designed to help owners verify whether a lease registration is legitimate, accurate, and authorized. If a property owner receives a notification for a contract they did not approve or recognize, they can take prompt action to address the issue.In such cases, owners are able to cancel the associated residency directly through the Sahel application using the “Cancel Residents” service, which PACI has also referred to as the “Remote Residents” service.As an alternative, property owners may visit PACI’s headquarters in person to complete the required procedures.The authority said the new service enhances monitoring of rental contracts across Kuwait and plays a key role in preventing the misuse of residential addresses. By ensuring that residency information tied to properties is current and accurate, PACI aims to reduce unauthorized registrations and improve the reliability of national civil data.PACI explained that the introduction of the Residence Notification service is part of its broader efforts to digitize public services, improve data accuracy, and strengthen coordination between government entities. Officials noted that the initiative supports the government’s wider strategy to build integrated digital platforms that improve efficiency, transparency, and overall user experience for both citizens and residents.","The Public Authority for Civil Information announced the launch of its new “Residence Notification” service through the unified government application Sahel.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

A widespread outage disrupted Verizon’s mobile and data services across the United States on Wednesday, leaving tens of thousands of customers unable to make calls or access cellular data, The New York Times reported.According to the report, Verizon said it was working to restore services after more than 170,000 users flagged problems on Downdetector, a website that tracks service disruptions. The tracker showed the outage began just after noon.

Dilbert Principle: How Scott Adams deciphered the corporate absurdity of our lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dilbert-principle-how-scott-adams-deciphered-corporate-absurdity-of-our-lives/articleshow/126527872.cms,"Trump Slammed Over AI-Tribute To 'Dilbert' Creator Scott Adams

Hard work is rewarding. Taking credit for other people’s hard work is rewarding and faster.

The goal of management is not productivity. It’s plausible deniability.

The purpose of a meeting is to create the illusion that something is happening.

Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems, they will invent some.

The appearance of competence is more important than competence itself.

The trick to success is learning which rules matter and which ones don’t.

Every system eventually evolves into one that rewards conformity over results.





A lot has been written about Scott Adams, the creator of the popular comic strip Dilbert, who passed away after a protracted battle with prostate cancer.The Washington Post’s eulogy, the same paper that once called Baghdadi an “austere scholar,” had the lede:“Scott Adams, who became a hero to millions of cubicle-dwelling office workers as the creator of the satirical comic strip Dilbert, only to rebrand himself as a digital provocateur — at home in the Trump era’s right-wing mediasphere — with inflammatory comments about race, politics and identity, died Jan. 13. He was 68.”The New York Times obituary read: “Scott Adams, whose experience as a bank and phone company middle manager gave him the material to create the comic strip Dilbert, a daily satire of corporate life that became a sensation but was dropped by more than 1,000 newspapers after he made racist comments on his podcast in 2023, died on Tuesday at his home in Pleasanton, Calif., in the Bay Area. He was 68.”People magazine labelled him the “disgraced” Dilbert creator and, after online outrage, removed the author’s name altogether.But perhaps the best way to remember Scott Adams is through his own words.He once wrote: “I have poor art skills, mediocre business skills, good but not great writing talent, and an early knowledge of the Internet. And I have a good but not great sense of humour. I’m like one big mediocre soup. None of my skills are world-class, but when my mediocre skills are combined, they become a powerful market force.”And it was, as developers would call it, a full stack.Dilbert was remarkable simply because it was relatable. What made Adams unique was his firm grasp of the absurdity of the capitalist machine, which made Dilbert, in its own way, the ideological sequel to Yes Minister.Much like Yes Minister captured the absurdity of how bureaucracies function, Dilbert captured the intricacies of the institution that evolved from bureaucracies: the corporation.If Yes Minister showed the tussle between bureaucracy and the executive, Dilbert captured the fight between management, which wants all the credit, and employees, who end up with all the blame.Scott Adams drew on his own experiences to capture this absurdity.The Dilbert Principle started as a riff on the Peter Principle. The Peter Principle states that one rises to one’s level of incompetence in any corporate setup.The Dilbert Principle, at its core, holds that the most incompetent people are deliberately moved into management, where they can do the least damage.At its starkest, Dilbertism is not just a satire of office life. It is an accusation. It argues that modern corporations are not inefficient by accident but irrational by design. That they reward those who talk over those who think, those who manage optics over those who deliver outcomes.In the Dilbert universe, intelligence is a liability, competence is invisible, and clarity is career-limiting. Power flows not to the capable but to the unaccountable. What Adams captured, with brutal clarity, is that corporations do not fail despite incompetence. They often succeed because incompetence provides cover, hierarchy, and plausible deniability. Dilbertism is the recognition that the system is working exactly as intended. Just not for the people doing the work.He amplified the absurdity with which incompetence thrives and is actively protected in corporate cultures; that meetings exist to distribute blame rather than create outcomes; that management language, even in the pre-GPT era, was designed to sound intelligent while conveying nothing. It captured the LinkedIn-post ethos of weaponised incompetence even before it existed.Consider some of his gems:Adams left for the Elysian plane after a protracted battle with prostate cancer. He continued to create Dilbert till his last days. On November 25 last year, he tweeted that his right hand had focal dystonia and his left hand was semi-paralysed, and that his art director would draw Dilbert while he continued to write it.Of course, Adams’ departure was only his second “death.” The first came in 2023, when his comic strip was dropped from syndication after he said that Black respondents who disagreed with the phrase “it’s okay to be white” constituted a “hate group.” His follow-up comment — “I don’t want anything to do with them and my best advice to white people is to get the hell away from Black people” — earned widespread condemnation. The strip was dropped by all major publications and effectively cancelled. Given his public support for Donald Trump since 2016, the rupture was perhaps inevitable.Adams’ political evolution was as controversial as it was deliberate. A long-time student of persuasion, hypnosis, and narrative framing, he supported Trump early not because he admired Trump’s morality or governance, but because he believed Trump to be a master persuader who intuitively understood media dynamics better than his critics. Adams repeatedly argued that politics was not about policy but about storytelling, emotion, and perception. He dismissed traditional fact-checking as politically irrelevant and described modern voters as driven more by narrative resonance than empirical truth.Over time, this worldview hardened into a contrarian, often abrasive stance on race, identity politics, gender, and institutional trust. He framed himself as anti-woke, anti-establishment, and sceptical of elite consensus, positioning his provocations as “clarity” rather than cruelty. Critics saw a man sliding into grievance politics; Adams saw himself as a diagnostician pointing out uncomfortable truths about persuasion, power, and social fracture. Whether one agrees or not, his political commentary followed the same pattern as Dilbert: reduce complex systems to their ugliest incentives and then laugh at the result.Adams’ comments raise a perennial question about creators: should we remember them for the work they brought into the world or the magic they created through it? Either way, Adams would have found it funny.Adams once made a caustic yet accurate observation about civilisation. Explaining how the printing press ensured that no good ideas ever truly died, he wrote: “We are a planet of nearly six billion ninnies living in a civilisation that was designed by a few thousand amazingly smart deviants.”He elaborated: “All the technology that surrounds us, all the management theories, the economic models that predict and guide our behaviour, the science that helps us live to eighty — it’s all created by a tiny percentage of deviant smart people. The rest of us are treading water as fast as we can.”His favourite example to buttress the point: “True example: Kodak introduced a single-use camera called the Weekender. Customers have called the support line to ask if it’s okay to use it during the week.”The word “genius” is used with wanton abandon these days, but it fits Scott Adams. He was not one of the deviants who designed civilisation, but he was one of the few who explained it to the ninnies trapped inside it. In doing so, he turned confusion into clarity, frustration into laughter, and work into something survivable. That, too, is a civilisational contribution. Because without art, are we even human?","Scott Adams, the creator of the popular comic strip Dilbert, who passed away after a protracted battle with prostate cancer, was 68. What made Adams unique was his firm grasp of the absurdity of the capitalist machine, which made Dilbert the ideological sequel to Yes Minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126527954,imgsize-75196,width-400,resizemode-4/how-scott-adams-deciphered-corporate-life.jpg"

Starting your next holiday from Dubai International (DXB) is about to get a lot smoother. In a major move to end the era of paper tickets and long queues at payment machines, Dubai Airports and Salik Company PJSC have officially signed a landmark 10-year agreement.This partnership brings the same ""drive-through"" convenience you enjoy on the highways directly to the airport parking lots.Dubai Airports has teamed up with Salik, Dubai’s road toll operator, in a new 10-year partnership to bring e-wallet parking payments to Dubai International Airport (DXB), one of the world’s busiest airports. The agreement, signed in a ceremony attended by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai Airports and Mattar Al Tayer, Chairman of Salik, marks a significant step towards smarter, more efficient parking management at the airport.Under this deal, drivers will be able to pay for parking using the Salik E-Wallet system across all paid car parks at DXB, eliminating the need for physical tickets or separate payment machines. This initiative will go live from 22 January 2026, covering all three passenger terminals and the Cargo Mega Terminal.This high-tech upgrade isn't just for a few select spots; it’s a massive rollout that covers the heart of the world's busiest international airport. Beginning January 22, 2026, the system will go live across 7,400 parking spaces at:Whether you are dropping off family at Terminal 3 or picking up a shipment at the Cargo Terminal, the system ensures you can drive in and out without ever stopping at a manual pay booth.This airport partnership builds on Salik’s broader efforts to digitize and expand its e-wallet system beyond just tolling. Salik has been integrating its e-wallet capabilities with private parking operators and smart parking systems across Dubai and the wider UAE, giving drivers more convenient ways to pay without cash or cards.For example:These efforts reflect a wider push in Dubai to modernize urban mobility and reduce friction in everyday services, from parking and toll payments to future integrations like fuel and EV charging payments using a unified digital wallet.This partnership was witnessed by top leaders, including H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai Airports, and Mattar Al Tayer, Chairman of Salik.They emphasized that this move is part of Dubai’s broader goal to become the world’s smartest city.

Dubai’s Palm Monorail halts service indefinitely: 5 best alternative routes to get around Palm Jumeirah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubais-palm-monorail-halts-service-indefinitely-5-best-alternative-routes-to-get-around-palm-jumeirah/articleshow/126484934.cms,"Dubai Palm Monorail Suspended Indefinitely for Maintenance: 5 Best Alternative Routes You Need to Know

Palm Monorail: From iconic connector to maintenance standstill



Israel On HIGH ALERT As Trump ‘FINALISES’ US Attack On Iran Amid Bloody Khamenei Crackdown | Watch

What’s behind Palm Monorail's closure?



Extended maintenance resulting in major upgrades to stations, track infrastructure or vehicle systems.

Partial reopening first, serving select peak hours or routes before full reinstatement.

Integration with future transit plans, potentially tying to expanded urban transport networks like the Dubai Metro Red Line extensions (long-term conceptual plans have discussed broader connectivity between the Palm and mainland transit)

Dubai commuters adjust with alternatives



Taxis and Ride-Hailing Apps (Fastest and Most Convenient): Best for tourists, families, hotel guests, short stays, taxis remain the most direct and time-efficient option to reach hotels, beach clubs and attractions across Palm Jumeirah. They are widely available across Dubai with drop-off directly at Atlantis, The Pointe, Nakheel Mall and hotels. They are ideal during hot weather or peak tourist season. Tip: During weekends and evenings, allow extra time due to traffic at Palm entry points. RTA Buses (Budget-Friendly Option): Best for budget travellers and daily commuters, Dubai’s public buses continue to serve Palm Jumeirah and nearby areas. Bus routes connect Palm Gateway with Dubai Tram and Metro stations, have affordable fares using Nol cards and are reliable but slower than taxis. Tip: Expect longer travel times during peak hours, especially in winter tourism season. Dubai Tram and Taxi Combination (Balanced Option): Best for visitors staying near Dubai Marina or JBR, take the Dubai Tram to Palm Jumeirah Gateway and switch to a taxi for internal Palm travel. This option balances cost and convenience, especially for those already near tram routes. Private Cars and Hotel Shuttles (Most Flexible): These are best for residents, long-term visitors and hotel guests. Many hotels on the Palm offer complimentary shuttle services. Private cars allow flexibility but can face congestion at peak times. Parking is available at major attractions like Atlantis and Nakheel Mall. Tip: Check hotel shuttle schedules in advance to avoid waiting times. Water Transport (Scenic, Limited Availability): Best for leisure travellers, some operators offer water taxis and private boat services connecting the Palm with Marina or mainland Dubai. These are scenic and relaxing with limited routes and schedules but are typically more expensive than land transport

Key advice for travellers

Re-evaluate peak-day plans to allow extra travel time across Palm Jumeirah.

Use taxis or buses from Palm stations to reach Atlantis, Aquaventure and other attractions.

Check official social channels frequently, as operators have pledged to update passengers once service resumes. Follow official Palm Monorail channels for reopening updates.

Plan extra time for Palm journeys during weekends and evenings.

Check hotel transport options before booking taxis.

If visiting Atlantis or Aquaventure, taxis remain the simplest option





Dubai’s iconic Palm Monorail, the first monorail in the Middle East and a key people-mover on Palm Jumeirah Island, has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work, leaving locals and tourists alike in transit limbo as the route connecting the Palm to the mainland remains closed with no confirmed reopening date. The announcement came via the monorail’s official channels, with operators confirming that station maintenance is the reason behind the service stoppage. While riders and commuters await updates, alternative transport like taxis, buses and private vehicles have become the de facto way to traverse the popular destination.The Palm Monorail, which first opened in April 2009 and runs approximately 5.45 km across the famed Palm Jumeirah to Atlantis Aquaventure Resort, has served residents, hotel guests and visitors for over 16 years. Designed as a scenic and efficient link across the inland portion of the man-made island, it features four stations and was operated by UK-based transport firm Serco.This suspension marks one of the most significant disruptions to the fleet since its launch and critically, there is currently no timeline for service resumption. While the monorail has historically played a niche role in the city’s broader transit ecosystem (with other heavy traffic handled by road vehicles and the Dubai Metro), it has nonetheless been a memorable part of the Palm experience, often recommended by guides and included in visitor itineraries.According to official statements and travel reports, the shutdown is due to ongoing station maintenance across the monorail network. The operators emphasised that this maintenance is vital to ensure long-term efficiency and safety. It is a necessity for infrastructure nearing two decades of operation.However, there are no published details about the scope, duration or specific technical issues being addressed and a reopening date has not been announced. The lack of a firm timeline has caught many by surprise, including frequent riders and tourists planning visits during Dubai’s peak travel months.For tourists, the monorail was not only functional but scenic and offered elevated views of the Palm trunk, fronds and skyline beyond. Its absence removes one of the region’s most visually distinctive transport experiences, with many visitors now questioning whether a Palm Jumeirah visit will feel less complete without it.Dubai’s transport ecosystem continues to accommodate tens of thousands of daily commuters via roads, ferries, the Dubai Metro and buses, but the monorail’s suspension, especially without a reopening timeline, has created a sense of uncertainty for travel planners and local enthusiasts alike. Unlike typical ride or track refurbishments in theme parks or transit systems worldwide, where scheduled closures often come with reopening forecasts, Dubai’s monorail maintenance appears to be in a more fluid or potentially extensive phase.For instance, other major attractions that undergo periodic maintenance (such as aerial tramways elsewhere) often announce specific closure windows and reopening dates well in advance. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California, for example, closed for its annual maintenance and clearly communicated both start and reparative timelines months before reopening.By contrast, the Palm Monorail closure has only been explained as a maintenance necessity, with no estimated timeline distributed so far. It is a situation that could hint at deeper or more unpredictable engineering work underway. There are a few possible scenarios for the Palm Monorail’s future:While operators have not issued such updates, Dubai’s dynamic urban growth suggests that transport infrastructure will continue to evolve, and the monorail, as a symbolic and strategic asset, may yet be refashioned to play a renewed role once technical work is complete.With Dubai’s Palm Monorail suspended indefinitely for maintenance, residents and visitors heading to Palm Jumeirah will need to rely on alternative transport options. Here’s a simple guide to the fastest, easiest and most practical ways to move around the Palm while the monorail remains out of service.Though these options maintain mobility, riders have noted longer transit times, especially during rush hours or high-season tourism peaks. Some social media users have expressed frustration at the lack of clarity about when the monorail might return, underscoring how the system is valued both as transport and as a leisure experience.For visitors planning Dubai itineraries in early 2026, the monorail closure means:The Palm Monorail, a once-celebrated urban transport highlight, is out of service for essential maintenance with no reopening date yet. The closure underscores both Dubai’s commitment to long-term safety and the challenges of sustaining ageing transport systems in a rapidly growing city.Though seemingly minor in the grand scheme of Dubai’s transport network, the monorail’s indefinite suspension stands as a reminder that iconic infrastructure sometimes needs serious upkeep and that even world-class cities must balance maintenance demands with high expectations from residents and visitors alike. While the Palm Monorail remains closed with no reopening date announced, Palm Jumeirah is still fully accessible.Taxis and buses are currently the most reliable alternatives, while tram links and hotel shuttles help bridge the gap. With a bit of planning, getting around the Palm remains smooth, even without its iconic monorail.","Dubai's iconic Palm Monorail has suspended operations indefinitely for essential maintenance work.

Kuwait extends newborn registration window to 120 days for Civil IDs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwait-extends-newborn-registration-window-to-120-days-for-civil-ids/articleshow/126478222.cms,"Kuwait increases time limit to 120 days for baby registration / AI Illustration

Kuwait newborn registration 2026

Deadlines for citizens and expats

Kuwaiti Citizens: Must register within 30 days of returning to the country.



GCC Citizens: Have a 30-day window from the date of their arrival in Kuwait.



Expatriates: Must complete registration within 30 days of obtaining their residency permit.



Penalties for missing deadlines

Fines: Penalties for non-compliance range from KD 2,000 to KD 3,000.



Settlement Options: In some cases, a settlement can be reached by paying KD 100 plus an additional KD 5 for every day of delay (capped at KD 2,000).







Welcoming a new member into the family is a whirlwind of joy, sleepless nights, and, inevitably, paperwork. In a major move to support families, Kuwaiti authorities have officially extended the deadline for registering newborns in the national civil information system. New parents now have a generous 120-day window to complete their baby’s registration, a significant shift designed to ease the administrative burden during those precious first months.The update comes directly from Sheikh Fahad Al-Yousef, the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, who also chairs the Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI). Under the new ministerial decision, the registration period for children born inside Kuwait has been pushed to four months from the date of birth.This change amends long-standing regulations to better reflect the logistical realities of modern parenting. By providing more time, the government aims to ensure that every child is documented accurately without forcing parents to rush through legal procedures while still recovering from childbirth or adjusting to a new routine.While the extension for newborns is the headline news, it is important to note that other registration deadlines remain strict. The Civil Information System serves as the backbone of Kuwait’s administrative data, and the Ministry of Interior maintains clear timelines for other categories of residents:These rules ensure that the national registry stays up to date, which is crucial for everything from healthcare planning to the distribution of public services.While the government is making the process more flexible, they are also getting tougher on those who ignore the law entirely. Recent legislative updates highlight that neglecting a child's documentation is no small matter. Failing to add a child to official nationality files or civil records can result in heavy financial hits:Authorities emphasize that these measures are about more than just bureaucracy; they are a commitment to child protection and the preservation of national identity. Ensuring a child has a Civil ID from the start guarantees their access to essential rights, including education and healthcare.This extension is part of a broader ""digital-first"" push in Kuwait. By streamlining how families interact with PACI and the Ministry of Health, the State is making it easier for citizens and residents to stay compliant. Parents are encouraged to utilize the Sahel app and other online portals to track their applications and ensure all document, such as attested marriage certificates and passports, are ready well within the new 120-day limit.","Kuwait has extended the deadline for registering newborns in the national civil information system.

""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok.

It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30.

This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month.

This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate.

, January 10, 2026:

Rule #1: Clarify what you truly want

Rule #2: Go big with the right collaborations

Rule #3: Tell your story with courage



Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content.

Rare Apple devices from different eras

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec. These include bowties, Bob Dylan 8-track tapes, and the wooden desk from Jobs’ bedroom at the Los Altos, California home later associated with the famed “Apple garage”.Other personal effects include components from Jobs’ own Apple-1 computer, hand-annotated car repair manuals, and a short handwritten note to his father on an early Apple business card.Rounding out the auction are original Apple marketing posters from the 1970s and 1980s, along with internal documents and ephemera from the company’s earliest phase. Together, the items offer a rare, material record of Apple’s origins and the personal world of its co-founder.Bidding for the collection is open until January 29, with interest expected to grow as the anniversary year approaches.","Collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.
