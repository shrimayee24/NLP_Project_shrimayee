NEW DELHI: Flagging the increasing threat posed by ‚Äòdeep fakes‚Äô and synthetically generated content capable of manipulating the electoral processes, the Election Commission on Friday directed all such content to be clearly marked with the labels ‚ÄòAI-generated‚Äô, ‚Äòdigitally enhanced‚Äô or ‚Äòsynthetic content‚Äô, covering a minimum 10% of the display area or audio clip, and also identify the entity responsible for its generation.In an advisory issued to the heads of all recognised political parties, the poll panel restricted the publishing or forwarding of any content that is unlawful or misrepresents the identity, appearance or voice of any person without his consent ‚Äúin a manner reasonably likely to mislead or deceive the electorate‚Äù. If any such hyper-realistic, synthetically-generated or AI-altered image, audio, video, misinformation or manipulated content is detected on official party handles, ‚Äúit shall be taken down within three hours of being noticed or reported,‚Äù it ordered.While directing that the label ‚ÄòAI generated‚Äô, ‚Äòdigitally enhanced‚Äô or ‚Äòsythetic content‚Äô shall be carried on top hand of the screen, EC asked such content to also prominently disclose the name of the entity responsible for its generation, in the metadata or accompanying caption.The commission also asked the political parties to maintain internal records of all Al-generated campaign materials, including creator details and timestamps, for verification when sought by the ECI.These directions ‚Äî issued in continuation of the EC advisories dated May 6, 2024 and January 16, 2025 ‚Äî come into immediate effect and shall henceforth be applicable during all general and bye-elections, EC said while reminding all the parties of their responsibility to ensure compliance with the IT Rules, 2021 and all its advisories.EC drew attention to AI-generated and hyper-realistic synthetically generated content depicting political leaders making electorally sensitive messages, saying that it was disrupting fair and equal conditions for all political participants, ‚Äúwhich is a sine qua non for preserving the integrity of the political campaigning during elections‚Äù.Describing such campaigns as a deep threat and challenge because of their ability to masquerade as the truth and unwittingly trap political stakeholders into incorrect conclusions, EC said it finds it imperative to ensure that transparency and accountability is maintained to preserve electoral integrity and voter trust.Earlier in May 2024 and January 2025, EC had issued guidelines regarding responsible and ethical use of social media platforms and specifically addressing concerns around labelling of synthetic and Al generated content used for election campaigning.","The Election Commission on Friday directed all such content to be clearly marked with the labels ‚ÄòAI-generated‚Äô, ‚Äòdigitally enhanced‚Äô or ‚Äòsynthetic content‚Äô The labels must cover a minimum 10% of the display area or audio clip, and also identify the entity responsible for its generation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124798335,imgsize-790046,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

""prompt injection,""

What cybersecurity experts said about new ChatGPT Atlas browser



‚ÄúThere will always be some residual risks around prompt injections because that‚Äôs just the nature of systems that interpret natural language and execute actions. In the security world, it‚Äôs a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, so we can expect to see other vulnerabilities emerge.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe main risk is that it collapses the boundary between the data and the instructions: it could turn an AI agent in a browser from a helpful tool to a potential attack vector against the user. So it can go and extract all of your emails and steal your personal data from work, or it can log into your Facebook account and steal your messages, or extract all of your passwords, so you‚Äôve given the agent unfiltered access to all of your accounts,‚Äù

What OpenAI said about ChatGPT Atlas browser‚Äôs security



‚ÄúOur long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, the same way you‚Äôd trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague or friend.

For this launch, we‚Äôve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks.

However, prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agents fall for these attacks,‚Äù

Cybersecurity experts have warned that OpenAI 's new ChatGPT Atlas browser could be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers can use this security flaw to turn AI assistants against users, potentially enabling theft of sensitive data or unauthorised access to bank accounts, experts claimed. The primary concern isa type of attack in which malicious instructions are fed to an AI system to make it behave in unintended ways, such as revealing sensitive information or performing harmful actions. Experts also said that all current AI browsers pose these security risks. OpenAI launched Atlas this week as an AI browser designed to help users execute tasks across the internet and search for answers.In a statement to Fortune, George Chalhoub, assistant professor at UCL Interaction Centre said:AI browsers face a security risk because they may not correctly distinguish user-generated prompts from content on untrusted websites. This allows attackers to create webpages containing hidden instructions that can trick the browser into performing actions such as opening the user‚Äôs email and exporting data.Some attackers may hide these commands using techniques like white text on a white background or embedding code within the site, making them difficult for users to notice but readable by the AI browser.Chalhoub explained.In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Dane Stuckey, OpenAI‚Äôs Chief Information Security Officer, said that the company was ‚Äúvery thoughtfully researching and mitigating‚Äù the risks associated with prompt injections.Stuckey wrote.Stuckey said OpenAI had introduced multiple measures to reduce risks and safeguard users, including rapid-response systems to block attacks, ongoing investment in research and security, and features such asandto enhance user control and safety.The ChatGPT Atlas browser is designed to make web browsing more interactive and assistive.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley‚Äôs Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don‚Äôt miss this annual celestial spectacle‚Äîperfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley‚Äôs Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of ‚Äúfalling stars.‚Äù The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can‚Äôt reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year‚Äôs Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That‚Äôs great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic ‚Äúfalling star‚Äù effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids‚Äô peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true ‚Äúsky full of falling stars‚Äù experience that‚Äôs hard to forget. The Orionids aren‚Äôt just any meteor shower, they‚Äôre remnants of Halley‚Äôs Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

A tragic night and a painful awakening

The science behind sleep and screens

A mother‚Äôs call for digital boundaries





Turning personal tragedy into a nationwide warning, a Virginia mother is urging parents to rethink the role of smartphones in their children‚Äôs lives, especially at night. Summer Bushman, from Salem, Virginia, lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year after months of bullying, both in person and online. In an interview with CBS News, she revealed that Autumn often used her phone in bed at night, a habit she now believes played a devastating role in her death. ‚ÄúShe was looking at her phone just before it happened,‚Äù Summer said. ‚ÄúI wish I had never let her keep it in her room.‚ÄùAutumn was, by all accounts, a bright and joyful child, a fourth-grade cheerleader who filled her home with music and dance. ‚ÄúShe turned my living room into a stage,‚Äù her mother recalled. But behind her bubbly exterior, Autumn was struggling with relentless teasing about her braces and appearance.Like many children today, she sought connection through her phone, the same device that became a portal for cyberbullying. Late-night messages and social media comments compounded the hurt. What once might have ended at the school gates now followed her home, glowing quietly from her pillow.Psychologists call this the ‚Äú24-hour schoolyard‚Äù, the digital extension of peer pressure and cruelty that leaves children little space to recover.On March 21, Autumn took her own life in her bedroom. When her mother found her, the phone‚Äôs screen was still on. ‚ÄúShe used to say she needed her alarm,‚Äù Summer said softly. ‚ÄúAnd every morning when I went to wake her, the alarm was ringing.‚ÄùThe tragedy reflects a troubling pattern seen across the world. In the United States alone, youth suicide rates have risen by over 50% in the past decade, with growing evidence linking social media use, especially at night, to depression and self-harm. A 2019 Lancet Psychiatry study found that adolescents spending more than three hours a day on social media were twice as likely to report mental health issues.Late-night phone use does more than expose children to online harm; it directly affects their mental and physical health. Screens emit blue light, which suppresses the hormone melatonin, disrupting natural sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation, in turn, intensifies anxiety, impulsivity, and depression, all factors linked to suicide risk.A recent Virginia Tech study reinforced this connection. Researchers found that nearly 75% of adolescents who attempted suicide were using screens shortly before and that most incidents occurred after 8 p.m. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty dangerous for bullied children to have their phones at night,‚Äù lead researcher Dr. Abhishek Reddy noted. ‚ÄúDuring the day, they have access to support, counsellors, teachers, parents. At night, that access disappears. ‚ÄùFor Summer, her daughter‚Äôs loss has become a mission. She now advocates for parents to remove phones from bedrooms, restrict nighttime use, and encourage healthier sleep routines. ‚ÄúIf I could go back, I‚Äôd take that phone away,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe deserved to live a long, happy life. Now, I‚Äôll never see her go to prom, get married, or chase her dreams.‚ÄùHer message echoes growing calls among educators and child psychologists to delay smartphone access for young children altogether. Some schools in the US and Europe are now implementing ‚Äúphone-free hours‚Äù or collecting devices during class to curb dependency.","Summer Bushman lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year.

Watch: Louvre Jewels Stolen In Seconds: Thief Caught On Camera





New footage has emerged showing the thieves who stole $100 million worth of jewels from the Louvre making a slow getaway in broad daylight in front of French peopleThe video shows two men ‚Äî one wearing a neon vest and another in a motorcycle helmet ‚Äî in the basket of a lift, slowly lowering to the ground from the world-famous museum in Paris, where they successfully pulled off the 7-minute heist.They appear in no rush, calmly reaching the ground on a construction lift attached to a stolen truck. Once they reached the ground, the men disappeared from view before police said they escaped on motorised scooters.The footage has gone viral on social media. It appears to have been filmed from inside the Louvre overlooking the Seine on Sunday, according to the Telegraph.French authorities are hunting four suspects in the robbery, which seems like something out of a Netflix series. The group reportedly parked a stolen truck outside the museum and used a construction lift to reach a second-floor window. They cut through the glass with an angle grinder before entering the Apollo Gallery. The alarm was triggered, but only reached guards focused on visitor safety.Inside the museum, another video shows the thieves casually cutting through a glass case while stunned guests looked on. They tried to set fire to their mobile ladder before fleeing, but failed. Furthermore, the burglars accidentally dropped an emerald-set imperial crown containing more than 1,300 diamonds that belonged to Empress Eugenie.The robbers abandoned the truck and its keys before escaping. A motorcycle helmet and a glove belonging to one of the criminals were recovered, but none of the suspects has been identified so far, authorities told Le Parisien.","Video shows two men slowly lowering to the ground from the world-famous museum in Paris.

Countdown Timers: A live display showing the remaining green light duration or the expected delay on the red light.

Optimal Speed Advice: Recommended speeds for drivers approaching an intersection to ensure a smooth, non-stop crossing.

Instant Alerts: Notifications for accidents, road closures, congestion, or necessary detours ahead.

AI-powered traffic management

Real-Time Analysis: The system uses computer vision to analyze footage from roadside cameras. It instantly detects congestion patterns, counts the volume and type of vehicles, and even monitors pedestrians and cyclists.

Intelligent Coordination: The system doesn't just manage one intersection; it coordinates entire road corridors to move ""platoons"" of vehicles smoothly across multiple traffic lights. This network management drastically reduces unnecessary stops.

Digital Twin Simulation: Before any new timing strategy is applied in the real world, the system tests it using a digital twin‚Äîa virtual copy of the road network. This ensures all adjustments are optimized and effective.

Possible roll-out date

Phase 1 Completion (UTC-UX Fusion): The AI-driven dynamic system is on track for full implementation across roughly 300 major intersections by the third quarter of 2026.

V2X Rollout (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure): The new V2X network is scheduled for full deployment and integration across all 620 signalized intersections between 2027 and 2028.

Will my new car be ready?

For New Cars: The RTA is actively collaborating with international car manufacturers to ensure that new vehicles entering the Dubai market are factory-equipped with the necessary built-in connectivity to talk to the V2X network.

For Older Cars: If you own an older vehicle, you will still benefit from the overall congestion reduction and can likely access key information through add-on devices or popular smartphone integration applications like CarPlay and Android Auto that display live traffic data on your screen.

How the egg-laying rocks form in Guizhou province

Cultural significance of the egg-laying rocks in Guizhou

Why Guizhou‚Äôs egg-laying rocks appear alive

Lessons from the mystery of Guizhou‚Äôs egg-laying rocks

Also read|





At first glance, the village of Gulu in China‚Äôs Guizhou province looks like any other quiet countryside. Rolling hills, green fields, and winding dirt paths paint a peaceful picture. But look closer, and you will see one of the strangest geological mysteries on Earth, rocks that appear to ‚Äúlay eggs.‚Äù Every few decades, smooth oval stones seem to emerge from the cliff faces, as if the mountains themselves are producing them. Locals call them egg stones, and for generations, they have inspired folklore about living rocks and hidden natural powers.A peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Geological Research explains that this strange phenomenon is purely geological. These so-called egg-laying rocks, scientifically referred to as concretions, form when minerals such as calcium carbonate gradually cement together within layers of softer shale. Over millions of years, groundwater chemistry and pressure shape these mineral clusters until erosion exposes them. As the softer outer rock wears away, the harder, rounded concretions fall out, giving the illusion that the rocks are ‚Äúlaying eggs.The cliffs of Guizhou are mainly made of calcareous mudstone, a rock that erodes faster than the smooth, dense concretions hidden inside it. When wind, water, and temperature changes slowly break down the surface, the spherical ‚Äúegg‚Äù stones are gently pushed out. To an observer, it looks like the cliff has laid them. This process can take several decades, with new formations appearing every 20 to 30 years, making it both a rare and predictable event.Similar formations can be found around the world, including the Moeraki Boulders in New Zealand and the Cannonball Concretions in North Dakota, USA. However, what makes Guizhou‚Äôs egg-laying rocks unique is their strikingly uniform shape and the rhythmic pattern of their emergence. These clues suggest that the region‚Äôs underground mineral conditions are unusually consistent, allowing the concretions to develop in near-perfect spheres.Before scientific studies shed light on the phenomenon, the people of Gulu village believed the rocks were a divine gift. Some saw them as symbols of fertility, while others considered them protectors of the land. Families often kept the stones in their homes for luck or offered them in temples as tokens of gratitude. The merging of folklore and natural science makes these rocks more than just a geological wonder, they are part of a living cultural story.Even today, tourists travel to Gulu to witness the mystery firsthand. Local guides blend fact with folklore, telling visitors tales of ‚Äúliving cliffs‚Äù and ‚Äúdragon eggs‚Äù that guard the valley. For them, the wonder of the egg-laying rocks lies not just in how they form, but in the enduring questions they raise about nature‚Äôs hidden rhythms.Part of the reason these formations feel ‚Äúalive‚Äù is because they appear to regenerate. After one batch of stones falls off, new ones begin forming beneath the surface. Over decades, as groundwater continues to flow through the rock layers, minerals deposit again in similar patterns, slowly creating new concretions. To the villagers, it feels like the mountain is producing life once more. To scientists, it is a perfect example of nature‚Äôs long, patient artistry, the slow choreography of chemistry, pressure, and time.This process reminds us how dynamic our planet really is. Even something as solid and silent as a rock is constantly evolving, shaped by invisible forces beneath our feet. In geological terms, the earth is never still; it breathes and transforms, only on a scale too vast for the human eye to see.The egg-laying rocks of Guizhou remind us that the planet is full of mysteries that blur the line between myth and science. What villagers once saw as living stones, scientists now recognise as remarkable examples of mineral formation. Yet, both perspectives capture the same truth, that the Earth is full of slow, beautiful processes that deserve our awe.In a world where everything moves quickly, these patient rocks teach us something profound. Life, growth, and change do not always happen fast. Sometimes, they unfold quietly over centuries, one layer at a time. And if you stand still long enough in Guizhou, watching the cliffs shed their smooth, egg-shaped stones, you might just start to believe that the Earth itself is alive.","The rocks in Guizhou province, China, appear to ‚Äòlay eggs‚Äô Every few decades, smooth oval stones seem to emerge from the cliff faces.

Artificial intelligence entrepreneur and neuroscience researcher Max Bennett has a fascinating thesis in A Brief History of Intelligence: Why The Evolution Of The Brain Holds The Key To The Future Of AI ‚Äì understanding how biological intelligence evolved can show the path towards more advanced AI.In a book that bridges neuroscience, evolutionary biology and artificial intelligence, Bennett asks why is it so tough to get supersmart ‚ÄòAI‚Äô to do the simplest of tasks like load a dishwasher? How is it that AI can be ‚Äòdumb‚Äô about tasks humans do effortlessly? The book argues that five major breakthroughs in the evolution of intelligence are critical, and it is essential to understand how the brain evolved, from bilateral creatures to multilateral animals and ultimately in humans, to take AI to the next league.Each breakthrough represents a fundamentalcapability that emerged in evolutionary history. These are: * Steering that evolved (600+ mn years ago) when early creatures like jellyfish developed basic navigation and goal-directed behaviour. * Reinforcement learning (500+ mn years ago), as vertebrates evolved the ability to learn from trial and error. * Simulating (100+ mn years ago), when mammals developed the capacity to create internal models of the world.* Mentalising (30+ million years ago) when primates evolved theory of mind ‚Äì understanding others‚Äô intentions. * Language or speaking (100,000+ years ago) when humans gained symbolic communication and abstract reasoning.Bennett argues current AI has achieved breakthroughs in steering and reinforcement learning but struggles with simulating, mentalising and language. This explains why AI excels at pattern recognition and optimisation but fails at common-sense reasoning, planning with mental models as well as in social intelligence.Each breakthrough required new brain structures working alongside, mind but not replacing, older systems ‚Äì suggesting AI may need similar architectural innovations rather than just bigger neural networks.AI‚Äôs struggle to move from reinforcement learning to simulation is one of the most crucial bottlenecks in modern AI. Simulation isn‚Äôt just about running predictions ‚Äìit‚Äôs about having an internal model of how the world works that you can mentally run to imagine outcomes before acting.Bennett points to specific evolutionary innovations in mammals. The neocortex that stores rich sensory models and patterns. Then the hippocampus that creates cognitive maps and episodic simulations. And the prefrontal cortex, which runs ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô scenarios using these models. These regions work together to maintain a persistent world model, run counterfactual simulations and update the model based on prediction errors.The neocortex is continuously comparing actual sensory data with data predicted by its simulation. This is how you can immediately identify anything surprising that occurs in surroundings. For instance, you don‚Äôt look where you place your feet when walking, but if there‚Äôs no ground when you‚Äôre about to place your foot, the brain immediately predicts outcomes, figures out options. That‚Äôs where and why current AI gets stuck.Current AI is only deep learning networks that are essentially pattern matchers without separate systems for world modelling and simulation of futures. The transition from reinforcement learning to simulation wasn‚Äôt merely adding more neurons. The neocortex is not just a bigger version of earlier brain structures but a qualitatively different system. Scaling up current approaches won‚Äôt work. Development of simulation took 100+ mn years of evolutionary tinkering, which humans are attempting to swing within decades.","Bennett argues current AI has achieved breakthroughs in steering and reinforcement learning but struggles with simulating, mentalising and language.

Impact on online leftists and Hasan Piker‚Äôs political commentary approach





Streamer and political commentator Hasan Piker recently addressed his audience during a livestream, emphasizing the need for critical political evaluation. He urged liberals, and particularly online leftists, to look beyond surface-level messaging, political branding, and labels when assessing public figures. Instead, Piker stressed the importance of analyzing actual policies, track records, and real-world impacts to avoid being misled by appearances or marketing tactics.During the livestream, Piker argued that many viewers are too easily swayed by how politicians present themselves, rather than examining what they truly represent.he said, criticizing reliance on political branding over substance. He described much of online political discourse as manipulative and cautioned that people often overlook concrete positions in favor of appealing imagery or rhetoric.Piker specifically called out Andrew Cuomo, who is currently running for New York mayor, as an example of someone whose public image may be misleading. The commentator urged viewers to prioritize actions and policy outcomes, rather than simply trusting labels likeorHe emphasized that this type of political discernment is crucial for understanding which figures genuinely support meaningful change.The livestream reflects Piker‚Äôs long-standing approach of challenging online leftists to differentiate between ideology and presentation. He frequently emphasizes that labels matter far less than tangible results and material outcomes. His content often blends news analysis, pop culture reactions, and unfiltered commentary, encouraging his audience to question narratives pushed by both politicians and mainstream media.By highlighting these issues, Piker underscores the responsibility of viewers to remain informed and critical. His arguments suggest that a deeper, policy-focused approach to political evaluation is essential for preventing manipulation and promoting accountability. The streamer‚Äôs direct style has helped him build a large following, with fans appreciating his willingness to address uncomfortable truths and push for analytical thinking.Piker‚Äôs message serves as a reminder that political engagement requires more than passive consumption, it demands active scrutiny and careful consideration of what leaders actually do, not just what they claim or label themselves.Also Read: Pok√©mon VGC champion WolfeyGlick opens up about groping and online harassment","Hasan Piker, a political commentator, recently addressed his audience during a livestream.

Protecting youth: UAE‚Äôs vigilance against hidden substance threats









Abu Dhabi Police have firmly dismissed circulating social media rumours about so-called ‚Äúred pills‚Äù being distributed in schools and universities, reinforcing the importance of verified information and community vigilance. The denial comes as authorities continue to strengthen digital and physical security awareness across the UAE.Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Abu Dhabi Police General Command, confirmed that reports of red pills in educational institutions are entirely baseless, according to. He stated,Al Dhaheri further highlighted the broader context, noting,He emphasized the critical need to rely on official sources, adding that Abu Dhabi Police maintain transparency and trust in their public engagement and ‚Äúnever hide anything‚Äù from the community.Abu Dhabi Police maintain a continuous presence in schools, universities, and community spaces, engaging with students, parents, and other stakeholders to raise awareness on a wide range of issues‚Äîfrom crime prevention and digital safety to substance abuse and child protection. These programmes regularly involve visits to campuses, community councils, and public forums, emphasizing practical guidance on safeguarding personal, financial, and social wellbeing.An example of such efforts is the ongoing sixth edition of the ‚ÄúBe Cautious‚Äù campaign, a three-month initiative organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, other police departments, the UAE Cybersecurity Council, Abu Dhabi Media, First Abu Dhabi Bank, and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. The campaign highlights emerging online fraud methods, such as phishing links, misleading phone calls, fake prize notifications, and fraudulent e-commerce sites, while also reinforcing broader messages of vigilance and responsible behaviour in everyday life.Events and educational programmes are conducted across social and traditional media, community councils, universities, and schools, ensuring that all segments of society are informed. Brigadier Al Dhaheri emphasized stakeholder collaboration as a key factor in maximizing outreach and public impact.The handling of such rumours is supported by the Federal Decree-Law No. 55 of 2023 on Media Regulation, which organizes the media activities of individuals, organizations, media outlets, and free zones dedicated to media in the UAE.

However, the UAE maintains some of the world‚Äôs strictest anti-drug laws, ensuring that such threats are promptly addressed. Authorities are calling on families, schools, and universities to strengthen cooperation in protecting youth from such hidden dangers. Parents are urged to pay attention to where their children go, who they befriend, and what they bring home.Recent investigations have uncovered sophisticated new tactics used by drug traffickers to smuggle toxic substances into the local market, employing methods so deceptive that the items appear harmless to the unsuspecting eye. Officials report that traffickers are increasingly camouflaging these substances as everyday products that young people often use or consume, such as energy drinks, chewing gum, or even flavoured paper, highlighting the importance of vigilance and community awareness.",Abu Dhabi Police have firmly dismissed circulating social media rumours about so-called ‚Äúred pills‚Äù being distributed in schools and universities.

How UAE's digital system prioritizes first-time pilgrims?

Registration process and criteria

Bottom line





The UAE‚Äôs General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat has reported a historic surge in Hajj 2026 applications, with approximately 72,000 residents applying for a quota of just 6,228 pilgrims. This unprecedented number of applicants marks one of the highest submission rates in recent years and demonstrates the enduring spiritual significance of the pilgrimage for Emiratis.The spiritual call to perform Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, has drawn unprecedented demand in the UAE for the upcoming 2026 (1447 AH) season. The General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat (Awqaf) confirmed that approximately 72,000 applicants submitted their requests. This colossal number is competing for an official national quota set by Saudi Arabia: just 6,228 spots.This intense competition means the odds of selection are approximately 1 in 11.5. The registration window, which ran from September 24 to October 9, 2025, saw the demand surge digitally through Awqaf's smart app and official website. Authorities have begun the rigorous process of granting preliminary approvals, with final selection adhering strictly to the governance set by the Cabinet Resolution No.(32) of 2018.The UAE uses a lottery-based selection system to manage oversubscription fairly:This system ensures no bias in selection and gives all qualified applicants a fair chance, despite the record-breaking demand.Applicants can quickly check their selection status using the official UAE channels:Tip: Only applicants with confirmed notifications should proceed with travel arrangements and payments. Those not selected can stay on the waiting list for possible future allocation.To manage this overwhelming demand transparently and efficiently, the UAE relies entirely on a digital-first approach for applications. The entire process from registration to initial approval was conducted online. This early opening of registration months in advance is a key strategy to enhance efficiency and streamline services for the selected pilgrims.A core principle guiding the selection process is fairness, specifically prioritizing those who are undertaking the pilgrimage for the first time. The electronic system is designed to give preference to Emirati citizens who have not yet performed Hajj, ensuring that as many people as possible get the chance to fulfill this once-in-a-lifetime religious duty. Once preliminary approval is granted, applicants are contacted via their registered phone numbers and must strictly adhere to deadlines to finalize all necessary permits and procedures. Furthermore, the authorities have implemented a new, stricter accreditation system for Hajj campaign operators, focusing on vetting travel agencies for their service quality, financial stability, and track record.Registration for Hajj 2026 was conducted through the Authority‚Äôs official channels, including its smart app and website, with a deadline of October 9, 2025. The selection process adheres to Cabinet Resolution No. (32) of 2018 concerning the Hajj and Umrah System, ensuring a fair and transparent allocation of spots. Applicants who receive preliminary approval will be contacted via their registered phone numbers and must adhere to specified timelines to complete all necessary procedures.In anticipation of the upcoming pilgrimage, the Office for the Affairs of UAE Pilgrims has initiated comprehensive preparations to provide the best possible services and care for UAE pilgrims in the holy sites. This includes ensuring that all their needs are met with dedication and responsibility, upholding the UAE Government‚Äôs vision of excellence and quality.The high number of applicants for Hajj 2026 reflects the enduring spiritual commitment of UAE residents. While the limited quota presents challenges, the authorities' meticulous planning and support systems aim to ensure a smooth and fulfilling pilgrimage experience for those selected.","72,000 UAE pilgrims compete for only 6,228 spots, highlighting historic demand and rigorous selection process.

Why Dubai taxi ‚Äôs colour system works?





Dubai‚Äôs public transportation is renowned globally for its sophistication and user-friendly approach. Among its numerous transit options, the taxi network stands out for its unique feature - brightly coloured roofs. These colours are not mere aesthetics but represent different taxi operators under the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), ensuring order in one of the world‚Äôs busiest taxi fleets. With over 12,000 taxis plying the city‚Äôs streets, understanding this colour code is essential for residents and visitors alike.Dubai‚Äôs taxi roof colour scheme was introduced in the late 2000s as a strategic move to unify and brand the city's taxi services. Previously, taxis were inconsistent in appearance and service quality, causing passenger confusion. Today, every taxi sports a uniform sand-coloured body, with the only visual differentiation on the roof. This system makes it easy for passengers to identify the operator, report lost items, and recognize the taxi‚Äôs route and purpose. Despite differing colours, all taxis operate under RTA regulations, guaranteeing consistent fares and safety standards.The coloured roofs correspond to specific taxi companies, each with distinct fleet sizes, service areas, and commitments to technology or sustainability.Though not widespread, purple roofs belong to Kabi Taxi, Dubai‚Äôs newest company focusing on modernity and practicality in their smaller fleet.Introduced in 2019 as a partnership between the RTA and ride-hailing giant Careem, Hala Taxi is a digital booking platform that connects passengers to the nearest available RTA-approved taxi, regardless of roof colour. This 24/7 service offers real-time tracking, seamless cashless payments, and convenience for riders. A ride booked via Hala Taxi typically starts at around AED 12, with fares regulated by the RTA to maintain consistency.Importantly, the colourful roofs do not affect the fare. All taxis follow the RTA‚Äôs standardized fare structure, which includes base fare, per kilometre charges, and waiting time costs that are consistent citywide. Any price differences generally come from booking platform service fees or minimum fare thresholds but never from the taxi operator.Dubai‚Äôs colour-coded taxi system facilitates efficiency and transparency. It helps passengers select taxis based on availability, preferred service (such as women-only rides), or environmental priorities without worrying about fare disparities or service standards. Furthermore, the system fosters healthy competition among operators, all while maintaining safety and regulatory oversight.Booking and Availability TipsWhile the popular ride-hailing app Careem connects users to all taxi types, it does not allow selection by roof colour. Passengers who prefer a specific taxi operator can call the respective hotlines or use operator-specific apps like DTC‚Äôs app for red and pink taxis. This increases the chances of getting a preferred taxi colour matching individual needs.In summary, Dubai‚Äôs taxi fleet is a model of organisation and clarity amid urban complexity. The colour-coded roofs help passengers easily identify taxi operators, with consistent fare pricing and safety regulations across all. From the large red fleet of Dubai Taxi Corporation to the environmentally friendly green Arabia Taxis and the women-only pink cabs, the system caters efficiently to diverse needs. With convenient booking via hotlines, apps, and the popular Hala Taxi platform, Dubai‚Äôs taxis offer reliable, accessible transportation for both residents and tourists.","Dubai‚Äôs taxi roof colour scheme was introduced in the late 2000s as a strategic move to unify and brand the city's taxi services.

The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) of Dubai has unveiled a revamped taxi fare structure applicable immediately to all smart app bookings and regular city taxis. The updated fare schedule introduces higher minimum charges and booking fees tailored to different times of the day and days of the week, aiming to streamline pricing and enhance service quality across the emirate.Under the new updated fare system, taxi rides booked via e-hailing platforms such as Hala and Careem now carry a minimum fare of AED 13, up from the previous AED 12. The booking fees and starting fares (flagfall) slightly fluctuate by peak, off-peak, and night-time windows.Peak HoursFrom Monday to Thursday, peak hours are set between 8 am and 9:59 am and later from 4 pm to 7:59 pm. During these time slots, passengers face a booking fee of AED 7.50 alongside a flagfall charge of AED 5. On Fridays, peak hours extend to 9:59 pm, with the same booking fee and starting fare. Meanwhile, Friday's late evenings between 10 pm and 11:59 pm see a slightly increased flagfall fare of AED 5.50, with the booking fee maintained at AED 7.50.Off-Peak and Night FaresOutside peak times on weekdays, from 6 am to 7:59 am and 10 am to 3:59 pm, the booking fee drops to AED 4 while the flagfall fare remains AED 5. Night-time travel, defined as between 10 pm and 5:59 am, carries a booking fee of AED 4.50 and a flagfall priced at AED 5.50.On weekends, Saturdays and Sundays experience peak periods from 4 pm to 9:59 pm and 10 pm to 11:59 pm, with a booking fee of AED 7.50 plus a flagfall of AED 5 during the early peak and AED 5.50 later into the night. Off-peak hours during the day maintain the AED 4 booking fee and AED 5 flagfall. The night-time booking and flagfall charges mirror weekday night tariffs.The comprehensive fare overhaul not only impacts commuter costs but aligns both traditional taxi and e-hailing pricing structures, providing greater consistency across transport options in Dubai.Aside from fare revisions, RTA has also launched a series of 28 initiatives enhancing the taxi experience. These include upgraded driver uniforms designed for Dubai‚Äôs climate, improved leather seating for hygiene and comfort, real-time air quality sensors installed in taxis, and integral feedback systems allowing passengers a direct line to RTA for service monitoring. Additionally, drivers benefit from reward programs totaling over AED 8 million.Commuters should expect slightly higher upfront costs during peak and late-night rides, but with improved ride quality underpinned by technological advances and service innovations by the RTA.The updated fares are effective immediately with the RTA monitoring usage and service levels to assess the impact of these changes on public transport in the city.","Dubai RTA announces taxi fare hike, surges booking fees for peak and night trips.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of‚Äîor as well as‚Äîbeing stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers‚Äîwhich currently serve as part of proof of the right to work‚Äîor on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy‚Äîpeople sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it‚Äîin theory‚Äîharder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will ‚Äútransition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet‚Äù as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens‚Äô app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a ‚Äúhoneypot for hackers‚Äù.India has well established digital ID system. India‚Äôs digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK‚Äôs planned system.New Delhi stores citizens‚Äô fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India‚Äôs ID system as a ‚Äúmassive success‚Äù.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia‚Äôs new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave ‚Äî which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests ‚Äî highlighted a broader industry trend.‚ÄúUsing a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,‚Äù Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia‚Äôs dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China‚Äôs DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: AI won't replace ‚Ä¶ jobs and he is hiring them in thousands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-ai-wont-replace-jobs-and-he-is-hiring-them-in-thousands/articleshow/124797899.cms,"What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Benioff says AI augments sales capacity, doesn't replace sellers

Salesforce's decision tells a different story





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff insists artificial intelligence won't eliminate sales positions, announcing plans to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople as the company pushes toward 20,000 account executives by year's end. Speaking in October 2025, Benioff emphasised that ""face-to-face communication"" remains essential in sales, stating that AI ""doesn't have a soul"" and lacks authentic human connectivity. The billionaire tech executive's stance comes despite Salesforce's aggressive AI adoption across other departments, including customer service where the company cut 4,000 roles earlier this year.""We love AI, OK? But AI ‚Äî it's not the same,"" Benioff told TBPN. ""It's not that human connectivity.""Benioff argues AI enhances rather than replaces human salespeople, addressing a problem Salesforce has faced for 26 years: unanswered leads. The CEO revealed that AI agents recently contacted 4,000 potential customers in one week‚Äîfollow-ups previously impossible with human-only teams.The combination of expanded human sales staff and AI assistance will increase Salesforce's overall sales capacity by 19%, Benioff projects.Among the company's 80,000 employees, roughly 25% are trained to help customers use Salesforce's sales products.While championing sales hiring, Benioff confirmed in September that Salesforce reduced customer support from 9,000 to 5,000 employees because he ""needs less heads."" The company's Agentforce AI platform now handles 50% of customer interactions, having completed over 1.2 million conversations since October 2024.The AI deployment reduced support costs by 17% and decreased case volumes enough that Salesforce no longer actively backfills support engineer positions, according to a company spokesperson.Benioff's divergent approach‚Äîexpanding sales while contracting support‚Äîreflects his belief that balance is crucial. ""If you turn it over to 100% AI, you're putting your whole company at risk,"" he told Axios in July, acknowledging the ""bumpy"" transition as companies navigate unprecedented technological change.","Salesforce to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople by year's end.
