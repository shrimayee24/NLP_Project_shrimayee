Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

HUID in the hallmarked gold jewellery



Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Paint gets a generative AI boost

Notepad gets AI for rewriting

Microsoft is bringing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess to nearly 40-year-old products: Paint and Notepad. The company has announced new AI experiences for Paint and Notepad to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels on Windows 11, aimed at enhancing creativity and productivity.Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative EraseGenerative Fill will allow users to add or modify elements within an image simply by describing what they want using text prompts. By selecting an area and providing a description, users can generate new content that blends with the existing image style.For example, users can ask the AI to make a mediaeval castle in the selected area of Windows XP wallpaper, and it will create one. This feature is initially available on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs.Generative Erase will enable users to remove unwanted objects from an image. By selecting the object to be erased, the AI intelligently fills in the surrounding area, making it look like the object was never there. This feature is available to all Windows 11 users.In addition to these new features, Microsoft is also improving the performance and expanding the availability of existing AI capabilities in Paint, such as Cocreator and Image Creator.Notepad, the simple text editor, is also getting a significant AI upgrade. The Rewrite feature will allow users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone and even modify the length of their text using AI. By selecting the text they want to rewrite, users can generate multiple variations and choose the one that best suits their needs. This feature is available in preview to all Windows 11 users in select regions.“We have also continued to improve Notepad launch performance. With this update, most users will see app launch time improve by more than 35%, with some users seeing improvements of 55% or more,” the company said.","Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative Erase.

Roblox , the popular online gaming platform that has faced scrutiny over allegations of misleading investors and concerns about children's exposure to inappropriate content, is implementing changes to address these issues.In a post on Roblox developers forum, the company has announced that it is “updating experience guideline policies to keep our younger users safe.” A report by Hindenburg Research in October highlighted the presence of sexually explicit content within the platform, raising concerns about child safety.Roblox has denied the charges.Roblox said that it is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non-accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.By default, users under the age of 13 will not be able to play, search, and discover unrated experiences. This will ensure that parents and users have more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox and will help them make more informed choices about what they want to play.We will be restricting access to Social Hangouts and Free-form User Creation experiences to users ages 13+.This means that starting December 3, Roblox will require creators to complete a questionnaire for each experience they wish to make available to users under 13. This questionnaire will help ensure that all experiences accessible to young users are age-appropriate and meet Roblox's community standards.As a result of this change, any unrated experiences will be hidden from search results and recommendations for users under 13. These users will still be able to access these experiences via direct link, but they will no longer be easily discoverable.The second big change is restricting social hangouts and free-form user creation for users under 13. Starting November 18, experiences featuring social hangouts and free-form 2D user creation will only be available to users 13 and older.This restriction applies to experiences where the primary purpose is socialising and communicating with other users, such as “vibe games” and virtual clubs.","Roblox is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non- accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.

This weekend’s much-anticipated episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists, alongside Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal and his wife, Mexican model Grecia Munoz (Gia Goyal). A recent teaser released by Netflix has already generated significant excitement, providing a glimpse into the candid, humorous, and heartwarming moments that await viewers. Hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma, the episode is set to showcase personal stories, cultural exchanges, and anecdotes from the lives of these remarkable personalities.In the teaser, NR Narayana Murthy, 78, reflects on his initial meeting with a young Sudha Murty, recalling the profound impact she had on him. Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year. Known for her vibrant personality and background in modeling, Grecia has embraced her role alongside Deepinder, even immersing herself in Zomato’s operations. During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon. The reaction of customers, who were surprised and delighted by Grecia’s appearance at their doorsteps, quickly became the highlight of the conversation.“When Gia delivers the order, the customers can’t help but keep staring,” Goyal laughed, prompting a burst of laughter from the audience and Kapil Sharma. The couple’s chemistry and lighthearted attitude have made them popular among Zomato’s users and the public, with fans appreciating Grecia’s willingness to engage directly with Goyal’s business and her adaptation to Indian culture.This is not the first time Sudha Murty has appeared on Kapil Sharma’s platform. Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples. While the Murthys are admired for their contributions to India’s technology and education sectors, Deepinder and Grecia have gained popularity as a young, modern couple who represent the global, interconnected nature of today’s India.Social media platforms have been abuzz with comments from viewers looking forward to the episode, with many expressing admiration for Sudha Murty’s humility and wit, and curiosity about Grecia’s adaptation to life in India. Fans also anticipate candid moments and stories from the lives of the Murthys and the Goyals, hoping for inspiring takeaways from both the established and next-generation leaders in India’s entrepreneurial landscape.","This weekend’s episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists.

Google clarifies how dots don’t matter in Gmail addresses: What it means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-clarifies-how-dots-dont-matter-in-gmail-addresses-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/115049940.cms,"What it means for users



How Gmail's dot feature may lead to privacy concerns



Emails sent to addresses with or without dots will still reach the same inbox. According to Google's support page, adding or removing dots from a Gmail address doesn't change the address. While this might seem confusing, on a support page, Google has clarified that dots are essentially ignored when processing Gmail addresses. This feature can be useful for creating variations of an email address for different purposes, such as filtering emails or signing up for services while protecting your primary address. This flexibility is a unique feature of Gmail and can help manage your inbox and online identity.For example, if a Gmail address belongs to a user, they will also own all variations of that address with dots inserted at any position. So, emails sent to abc123@gmail.com, or any other combination (e.g. abc.123@gmail.com) with dots will still reach their inbox.This means any Gmail address with dots inserted between the letters will still route to the user’s original inbox. Users will receive emails sent to all variations of their address, even if the sender accidentally types it with extra dots.While Gmail's ""dots don't matter"" feature offers flexibility, it can also lead to unintended privacy risks. Since emails sent to variations of a Gmail address with added or removed dots reach the same inbox, there's a chance that users may receive messages intended for someone else with a similar address.This could expose them to sensitive information, such as bank statements, credit card bills, or even OTPs, potentially leading to privacy breaches and financial fraud. However, this ""dots don't matter"" rule does not apply to Gmail addresses issued by organisations or educational institutions, offering some level of protection in those cases.Google emphasised that the ""dots don't matter"" feature doesn't compromise Gmail security or allow others to read a user’s emails. However, to address potential privacy concerns, Google recommends notifying the sender if they receive an email not intended for them. If the email appears to be a scam, report it as spam or phishing. Meanwhile, Ffr unwanted newsletters, users can simply unsubscribe.","Gmail's 'dots don't matter' feature can be useful for creating variations of an email address.

Randi Mahomes Takes to Social Media About Her Flight Woes

NFL Mom’s Bold and Unfiltered Social Presence Draws Mixed Reactions

A Controversial Sideline Appearance

Patrick Mahomes’ Diplomatic Approach Amid Family Controversies

The Mahomes Family: In the Spotlight and Unapologetically Open

With the Kansas City Chiefs sitting at a pristine 8-0 record, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes continues to capture national attention—both on the field and off. Beyond football, Mahomes is an ambassador for Airshare, one of the country’s largest private jet firms. His role with Airshare has allowed his family to experience the perks of private travel, though, as it turns out, even private jet connections can’t guarantee a smooth ride for everyone. Recently, Mahomes’ mother, Randi, shared a turbulent travel experience with her social media followers, offering a rare glimpse into her life beyond the Kansas City sidelines.Also read - ""NFL’s Schedule Expansion Brings High Workload, Five Players to Test Limits with 18-Game Season Randi Mahomes, a social media favorite among NFL fans, shared her pre-flight jitters with followers, writing, “Haven’t even boarded and they tell us it’s gonna be bumpy ride…” Accompanied by a nervous emoji, the post quickly attracted fan support and advice, with one follower suggesting she try listening to Christian music during the flight to calm her nerves—a tip she appreciated. Known for her openness on social media, Randi often interacts with fans over both lighthearted and personal matters, making her an approachable figure amid the fame of her son.Randi’s candid updates aren’t new to her followers. From celebrating family milestones to sharing her concerns over her father’s health, she has been forthright with fans on nearly every aspect of her life. However, her transparent style doesn’t always resonate positively with everyone. Her recent social posts about turbulent flights and family gatherings have sparked mixed reactions, reflecting the challenges of life under constant public scrutiny.Recently, Randi found herself at the center of an unexpected controversy. During a Monday Night Football matchup, she went viral for her stadium appearance decked out in a Chiefs-red jacket and a MAGA hat. In the video clip, Randi is seen enthusiastically cheering for the Chiefs while also shouting, “Make America Great Again.” While her support for her team drew admiration, her choice of headgear and chant elicited heated responses on social media. The incident drew comparisons to Patrick’s wife, Brittany, who has similarly faced backlash for vocalizing her own political views.Amid his family’s polarizing statements, Patrick Mahomes has maintained a neutral stance, balancing respect for his loved ones' views with a commitment to staying out of the political spotlight. “I don’t want to pressure anyone to vote for a particular president,” Mahomes has said in the past. He has encouraged fans to make informed voting choices, though he remains clear about his desire to stay focused on his career and avoid public political entanglements. Mahomes’ balanced approach has helped him navigate controversies, from light-hearted preseason banter to more serious matters involving family and politics.Whether it’s Randi’s candidness on social media, Brittany’s outspoken nature, or Patrick’s grace under pressure, the Mahomes family’s openness has made them one of the NFL’s most visible families. For fans, Randi’s updates are a reminder of the blend of glamour and real-life challenges that come with being an NFL mom. And with her next flight likely already on the calendar, perhaps she’ll encounter smoother skies—but if not, her fans can be sure she’ll let them know.Also read - ""NFL’s Schedule Expansion Brings High Workload, Five Players to Test Limits with 18-Game Season","Randi Mahomes is the mother of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Ravens' 'Purple Rising' helmets make prime-time debut against Bengals on Thursday Night Football



In an exciting twist for Week 10’s ""Thursday Night Football,"" the Baltimore Ravens are set to showcase a groundbreaking look against the Cincinnati Bengals. For the first time in their 29-year history, the Ravens will don striking purple helmets as part of their “Purple Rising” theme, transforming their traditional game-day appearance.Also Read: ""I got what I asked for"": Preston Smith opens up about trade request from Packers and why he wanted out This unique ensemble represents a significant departure from the team’s longstanding preference for black helmets, adding a new layer of style and pride to the Ravens' identity. The new matte purple helmet is adorned with distinct features that have fans buzzing. Accentuated with a gold facemask, the helmet includes bold “talon stripes” running down its centerline, intended to symbolize the fierce spirit of the Ravens. An alternate logo, featuring a forward-facing raven, also adds a fresh, modern twist to the traditional design. This marks only the third helmet style in the team’s history, but notably, the first time black has not been the primary color.All-Pro safety Kyle Hamilton shared his excitement about the new look, remarking, “I think it’s a good thing for the fans.” His hope was also voiced for a victorious outcome, as he added, “Hopefully we can get a win so we can wear them again.” Hamilton’s sentiments reflect the team’s enthusiasm for this vibrant addition to their wardrobe, which they hope will inspire the same fervor in their supporters.The Ravens are one of several teams taking advantage of the NFL’s more lenient rules this season on alternate helmets, a trend that has led teams like the Denver Broncos, Green Bay Packers, Houston Texans, and New York Jets to explore new colorways and designs. For Baltimore, the purple helmet serves as a unifying piece for the “Purple Rising” set, which includes matching purple jerseys that were previously showcased in their ""Color Rush"" games. This complete uniform look is expected to resonate with fans eager to see a bold and fresh aesthetic on the field.While the Ravens have experimented with helmet designs over the years, the base color had remained a steadfast black. The switch to purple marks an exciting moment for the team, adding a distinctive visual appeal and reinforcing their brand’s identity. This Thursday’s game promises not only an intense rivalry showdown but also a celebration of Baltimore’s evolution in style, embodying a unique mix of history and innovation as the team steps onto the field with a look as fierce as their ambition.Also Read: Micah Parsons remains optimistic about Cowboys’ playoff chances with Cooper Rush leading the offense","The Baltimore Ravens are set to showcase a groundbreaking look against the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday Night Football.

Is Taylor Swift ready for kids?

All ages have now fallen in love with Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour, and all of it has become very heart-warming because she's become a proper role model to the kids. And Taylor takes on that love with her personal touch; she makes every fan interaction a sort of magic encounter. One of her most cherished traditions is the one that occurs at ""22,"" where Taylor falls to her knees to present her lucky fan with her famous black hat.During a concert last weekend in Indiana, one little girl posed a question so out of the blue that it melted the star, causing her to give love to that girl. Travis Kelce noticed a whisper that perhaps Taylor might be ready to have a mini Swift one day.Also Read: Taylor Swift arrived at the Arrowhead Stadium to support her beau Travis Kelce and the Chiefs against the Buccaneers Taylor Swift's connection to Travis Kelce has sparked much public speculation, particularly since she became open about her life and the new attention he brings in the NFL. This adds a buzz to her personal life and draws media personalities as well as fans' attention. Swift has been able to keep her private life out of the spotlight until now.The ripples about the relationship of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been doing a lot, with speculations involving their relation, recent s*x life discussion by Kelce, probable break-up, and probably weddings. A touching moment with a young fan caused Taylor's maternal instincts, and fans are speculating about her readiness to begin a family. Fans are eagerly speculating about the future for Taylor and Travis.With Taylor Swift's openness about personal life, at times hidden in subtle moments, the end of the love saga is near for her, and fans are anxiously waiting for what the coming twist will bring, especially with speculations saying that perhaps they will begin a new family. This has, however, been proven true since Taylor has indeed gotten married to Joe Alwyn, and now their focus is on the growing and expansion of the family rather than the story itself, which is their life in love.Since Taylor Swift plunged into fame, she does each album in her story with the victories and her struggles.
