'She sold her TV to make a film': How a Purulia girl became Venice winner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/she-sold-her-tv-to-make-a-film-how-a-purulia-girl-became-venice-winner/articleshow/123877149.cms,"When filmmaker Anuparna Roy was a child, she listened wide-eyed as her grandmother spoke dreamily of a river. Her maternal grandmother, married at nine to a man in his 30s in Purulia district of West Bengal, often told her stories about the river's pure, beautiful water. ""I always thought she must have seen this river, but after she died, I came to know that she actually never did. Only her dead body was taken to a riverbank,"" says Roy, 31, on a Zoom call from Mumbai, two days after she returned - triumphant and tired - from the 82nd Venice Film Festival. There, she became the first Indian to win the Best Director Award in the Orizzonti (Horizons) section, joining a prestigious list of acclaimed auteurs.Those stories shaped Roy's 2023 debut short film 'Run to the River', which is based on her grandmother's life in British-era Bengal. ""The protagonist is a Dalit girl married to a revolutionary freedom fighter. But even though he was fighting for his country's freedom, he failed to provide freedom to his wife,"" she says. This weaving of family memory with larger social and political contradictions defines Roy's cinema.Her Venice win came with her debut feature 'Songs of Forgotten Trees' (SOFT), which follows two migrant women in Mumbai - a part-time sex worker and a call-center employee - who begin as strangers sharing a room, but slowly forge a quiet kinship.Born to a coal-sector worker and a homemaker, Roy is now celebrated as a grassroots-to-grandeur story, rising from a Purulia village to an internationally recognised filmmaker. Without film school training, she juggled IT and call centre jobs to fund her films. Yet she is wary of the ""struggle"" narrative. ""I was doing jobs to support myself and my family. To talk about liberation in my films, I first had to liberate myself economically,"" she says. Her remote IT job even helped during the shoot of SOFT: ""It was work from home. I would log in and then go off to shoot. I even received a message from my ex-manager saying he was proud of me. It was generous of him not to mention the kind of activities I used to do while 'working.' I was pathetic at that job!"" she laughs.Roy's work is driven by memories of survival and discrimination in rural India. Her latest film references a childhood friend, Jhuma Nath, whom her father forbade her to meet because she was Dalit. Married at 13, Jhuma left a deep impression on Roy. Other moments of gender bias also stayed with her - from girls being given rice in school when boys got books, to being told to cover her nose while passing a tribal village. Her grandmother's story also inspired the female kinship angle in SOFT. ""My grandmother, when she entered her marital home at nine, had a stepdaughter of the same age. The two bonded well, and after my grandfather died, these two women ran the family together. One earned, the other cooked and cared for four daughters. I began to imagine why they couldn't also fall in love with each other. That idea became the foundation of the film,"" Roy explains.Literature was her early training ground: James Joyce and Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay influenced her while she studied English (Hons) in Asansol. Her 21-year-old cousin Adrija, who took up the same subject because of her 'dear didi' recalls, ""She struggled so much, sold her belongings, exhausted all her energy and money. She even sold her TV while making her short film."" Producer Bibhanshu Rai describes her as ""stubborn and persistent,"" crediting her resourcefulness in bringing SOFT to completion.Roy is part of the new wave of Indian cinema centering women's agency and sisterhood, alongside names like Payal Kapadia. ""My next project will return to my grandmother's story, where the freedom struggle plays out alongside the bond between my grandmother and her stepdaughter,"" she says.As for advice to young, independent filmmakers from small towns, she offers a note of encouragement: ""Those who are writing a script and are not able to finish it, or not able to find a producer, they are already filmmakers for me. They're trying to make something, and I know they will because they'll always find a way.""",Anuparna Roy is the first Indian to win the Best Director Award at the Venice Film Festival. Her debut feature 'Songs of Forgotten Trees' (SOFT) follows two migrant women in Mumbai. Roy's work is driven by memories of survival and discrimination in rural India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123877171,imgsize-11056,width-400,resizemode-4/she-sold-her-tv-to-make-a-film-how-a-purulia-girl-became-venice-winner.jpg"

Alongside the Air, Apple also introduced the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro, as well as Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, SE 3, and AirPods Pro 3, further solidifying its unmatched ecosystem dominance. The highly anticipated launch has generated massive worldwide buzz across social media platforms, technology forums, industry panels, tech blogs, and consumer communities alike. Among notable reactions, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised the iPhone Air, calling it the first Apple upgrade he’s genuinely excited about in years, highlighting its significance even to forward-thinking industry innovators and dedicated Apple fans worldwide.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter): “First new iPhone upgrade I have really wanted in awhile! Looks very cool.”Altman’s endorsement signals that Apple’s innovative design and cutting-edge technology appeal not only to general consumers but also to leading tech innovators globally. His reaction amplified social media conversations, inspiring lively debates on the iPhone Air’s advantages, performance features, and comparisons with the iPhone 17 Pro.His endorsement further highlights how Apple continues to shape trends and influence leaders across AI, software, and broader technology sectors.Apple described the iPhone Air as “impossibly thin and light,” emphasising portability without sacrificing durability or premium feel. Its aerospace-grade aluminum frame and reinforced glass design ensure the device feels solid, sleek, and luxurious despite its lightweight build. The 5.6 mm thickness represents Apple’s ongoing focus on minimalist design, aligning with the company’s strategy to combine aesthetic appeal with practical usability, ergonomic comfort, and seamless functionality for everyday use. In addition, the iPhone 17 series brings major upgrades in display, battery, processing speed, and camera performance, maintaining Apple’s reputation for innovation, reliability, and cutting-edge technology.Beyond the hardware, Apple unveiled enhanced software features, including iOS 19 improvements for faster multitasking, new interactive widgets, AI-powered photography tools, and intelligent personalization options, which further enhance the overall user experience, convenience, and customization on the iPhone Air.The iPhone Air measures just 5.6 millimeters in thickness, making it roughly a third thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro, and it weighs 165 grams. Its 6.5-inch ProMotion display sits within a lightweight titanium-aluminum frame, combining durability with elegance.The iPhone Air’s camera system features 28mm and 35mm lenses, offering four focal lengths in total. The front-facing camera incorporates the Center Stage sensor, similar to other models in the iPhone 17 lineup.For protection and style, two cases are available: a translucent case less than 1mm thick in frost and shadow shades, and a lightweight bumper case offered in all four phone colors. Apple is additionally offering a cross-body strap to carry the iPhone Air conveniently.The iPhone Air will be available in black, white, light gold, and light blue.Pre-orders for the iPhone Air begin Friday,Apple emphasised how the iPhone Air works seamlessly with its ecosystem. Users can pair it with Apple Watch Series 11, AirPods Pro 3, and iCloud services, creating a connected experience. Features like Handoff, Continuity Camera, and Universal Control enable effortless interaction across devices. This ecosystem approach ensures that the iPhone Air is not just a phone but a central hub for productivity, entertainment, and communication.The launch sparked a flurry of reactions online.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.""According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said.“There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that,” the executive added.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees that the company needs to ""do better"" in rebuilding trust with its workforce.

Public behavior and legal restrictions during fasting hours

From sunrise to sunset, it is not permitted to eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum in any public area — including streets, cars, malls, cinemas, and workplaces.

This applies to everyone, including non-Muslims, and includes even when you are inside a vehicle.

Federal Law No. 3 of 1987, amended in 2006, clearly addresses this under Article 313:

Anyone caught eating, drinking, or smoking in public during fasting hours may face up to one month in jail or be fined AED 2,000.

Eating or drinking is only allowed in private spaces, such as your home, hotel room, or private office cabin.

The law and social norms are aligned in promoting respect for the fasting public, so even non-Muslims are expected to comply fully during daylight hours.



Dress, music, and public decorum during ramadan

Clothing should be modest and non-revealing throughout the month, especially in public places like restaurants, malls, and events.

Wearing tight or revealing outfits is strongly discouraged, even when attending dinners or nightlife venues.

Playing loud music — whether in your car, at home, or on the beach — should be avoided.

Listening to music privately is allowed, but make sure it cannot be heard outside.



On the beach or in shared spaces, use headphones to avoid disturbing others.

These practices reflect the general expectation of modesty and quiet reflection during Ramadan.



Navigating work, traffic, and meal timings during ramadan

Working hours across the UAE are shortened during Ramadan, with many offices closing earlier than usual.

This also impacts traffic patterns, with peak congestion often occurring:

In the morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM)





In the afternoon (1:00 PM to 3:00 PM)

Roads become especially busy before Iftar (sunset), as people hurry home to break their fast.

Avoid driving close to sunset if possible, as roads can be chaotic and hazardous at that time.

Restaurants tend to be very crowded after sunset, when families and groups gather for Iftar.

Make reservations in advance to secure a spot for dinner during this time.



Community engagement, charity, and social conduct

It is appropriate and appreciated to greet people with phrases like “Ramadan Kareem” or “Ramadan Mubarak” during the month.

Charity is a central value of Ramadan. Residents and visitors are encouraged to:

Contribute to humanitarian programs



Support local and international charities



Make small gestures of kindness toward the less fortunate

The month is also a time to engage in community and cultural exchanges.

Whether Muslim or non-Muslim, everyone is encouraged to reflect on values such as tolerance, compassion, and gratitude.

Interacting respectfully with neighbors, friends, and colleagues is part of embracing the spirit of the month.





During the holy month of Ramadan, daily life in the UAE undergoes a noticeable shift. This period is marked by fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims — but also brings important cultural and legal expectations for non-Muslim residents and tourists. Whether you’re living in the Emirates or visiting during Ramadan, knowing how to respectfully navigate public behavior, work routines, and social interactions is essential. Here’s a complete guide to what’s expected.","During Ramadan in the UAE, expats must avoid eating, smoking, and wear modest clothing in public.

Travellers flying from the UAE are being warned: even a slightly worn passport can now stop you from boarding. As immigration and airline checks tighten, minor wear and tear, such as frayed edges, water stains, or a scratched chip, is enough to get a valid passport rejected, regardless of visa status.International travellers departing from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah are facing increased scrutiny over the physical condition of their passports. UAE-based airlines are now enforcing stricter rules, often stopping passengers at check-in if their passports show even minor damage, regardless of visa validity or passport expiry date.Common types of damage that can raise red flags include:Authorities say these issues, though sometimes minor, may compromise embedded security features such as microchips, holograms, and machine-readable zones. If these features are damaged, passport scanners may fail, leading to suspicion of forgery or tampering by immigration officers.Airlines departing from the UAE are also held accountable. If a passenger is denied entry due to passport condition, the airline may face penalties or be required to bear the cost of deportation. This has made airlines extra cautious at the check-in stage, often barring travellers with visibly damaged passports from boarding at all.While the UAE is leading this push for pristine passports, other countries are also enforcing similar measures. The following nations are particularly strict about the condition of travel documents:Officials generally split passport damage into two categories:Even a partially damaged passport can lead to denial of boarding or entry. Travellers are strongly advised to renew their passport at the first signs of wear, before problems occur. Prevention is key: keeping the document dry, using a protective cover, and avoiding inserting papers or folding the passport helps maintain its integrity.Modern passports are more than just identification; they are high-security documents embedded with:Damage to any of these features can cause technical issues at automated border control gates or manual inspection points. A passport that fails to scan correctly could appear tampered with, triggering suspicion and potential detainment.Officials emphasize that the strict enforcement is to protect national security and maintain document integrity. With the rise in identity fraud and document forgery, immigration systems are designed to flag any inconsistencies, no matter how small.","Even a tiny tear or water stain on your passport can lead UAE airlines and immigration to refuse boarding, despite a valid visa.

ICBMs & ‘Guam Killer’:

New-age stealth fighters:





China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions.

Whether you're moving to the UAE to advance your career, begin university, or apply for long-term residency like the Golden Visa, one document is key to unlocking your future: the Certificate of Equivalency. Issued by the UAE Ministry of Education, this official document confirms that your foreign academic qualifications match the country's educational standards. Without it, opportunities can be delayed or even denied. Here’s everything you need to know who needs it, why it matters, and how to get it.A Certificate of Equivalency, also known as a Certificate of Recognition, is a formal document issued by the UAE Ministry of Education (MoE) to verify that a degree earned outside the UAE is equivalent to the country’s academic benchmarks.This certificate proves that:You must obtain an Equivalency Certificate if you're:Even if you have years of experience or hold senior roles, your degree needs to be recognized locally before you can legally practice, study, or be employed in many sectors in the UAE.As of November 1, 2024, all certificate equivalency services in the UAE are now handled by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR).

In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step.

On the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality. The International Astronomical Centre will stream the entire celestial event live from Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory, making it accessible to a global audience.The International Astronomical Centre confirmed that it will livestream the total lunar eclipse using a telescope stationed at the Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory. The broadcast is scheduled to run for more than four hours, from, providing uninterrupted real-time coverage of the phenomenon.According to Engineer Mohammed Shawkat Odah, Director of the International Astronomical Centre, the eclipse will unfold in several distinct stages:Odah noted that the most visually dramatic period — when the Moon turns a striking shade of red — will last 82 minutes, making it one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent years. This stage, known as totality, will be clearly visible to the naked eye across all seven emirates from 9:30 PM to 10:52 PM GST.Additionally, Odah stated that the phenomenon can be observed at different stages across the Arab region depending on geographic location:A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow (umbra) onto the Moon. During this alignment, sunlight passes through Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red tones to reach the Moon’s surface. This atmospheric refraction creates the phenomenon commonly known as a Blood Moon.Two aspects make tonight’s event particularly remarkable:The Moon will not completely disappear during totality. Instead, it will take on shades of orange, red, or yellow, depending on atmospheric conditions. According to Odah, the color intensity is a reflection of atmospheric purity. Increased pollution, for instance, can cause the Moon to appear dark red or brown. In rare instances, such as the December 12, 1992 eclipse (influenced by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines), the Moon has vanished entirely from view during totality.The total eclipse phase, where the Moon is fully immersed in the Earth’s umbra, will be. The timings for the totality are consistent nationwide:The Moon’s changing appearance, from bright white to glowing red, will be clearly visible without the need for telescopes, although observatories and livestreams will offer detailed views.Looking ahead, skywatchers in the UAE can mark their calendars for future lunar events:The next total eclipse will coincide with New Year’s Eve, setting the stage for another dramatic Blood Moon — this time, during year-end celebrations.","On September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality.

A unified vision for land and water mobility





Dubai is advancing its vision of a smarter, more connected city with two major transport projects now underway: the construction of the Dh20.5-billion Dubai Metro Blue Line and the launch of two new marine stations on Dubai Creek. These developments are set to significantly reduce congestion, cut travel times, and boost mobility across key urban and waterfront areas.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line, a massive infrastructure project that will expand the city’s rail network by 30 kilometres and add 14 new stations. As part of the initial works, a key traffic diversion has been introduced near Centrepoint Station, affecting access from Airport Road to the multi-storey car park.Motorists can now reach the car park via 49C Street, making a left turn west of the facility. The RTA has urged drivers to follow all directional signboards, plan trips ahead, and use alternative routes to avoid delays. Similar traffic changes are also in effect near Creek Station, as early construction continues there as well.The Blue Line is expected to open by September 9, 2029, and is designed to carry 46,000 passengers per hour in both directions.It aims to reduce traffic congestion by 20% on the routes it serves, cutting travel time between key residential areas and Dubai International Airport to just 20 minutes.When complete, the Blue Line will extend the total length of the Dubai Metro network to 131km, serving 78 stations and operating 28 trains. The project is expected to generate Dh56 million in profits and carry 200,000 passengers per day by 2030, with that number projected to rise to 320,000 by 2040.These areas are expected to be home to over one million people, as envisioned in the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan.Travel times along the Blue Line will range from 10 to 25 minutes, significantly improving daily commutes for thousands of residents.In a separate milestone, the RTA has also inaugurated two new marine transport stations:Both are strategically located on Dubai Creek and support the RTA’s Marine Transport Strategic Plan 2020–2030, which aims to make water transport a key part of the emirate’s mobility network.These stations follow the design principles of recently upgraded facilities like Bur Dubai and Old Deira Souq, combining modernisation with heritage preservation.The newly opened stations feature enhanced capacity and passenger experience, aligning with upgrades seen across the network, such as the 15% capacity increase at Deira Old Souq Station earlier this year.The stations were completed simultaneously to reduce costs and accelerate delivery, with a new operational plan in place to ensure timely trips, safe navigation, and efficient services.Marine transport ridership is on the rise, with 9.7 million passengers using the network in the first half of 2025 alone — a strong indicator of public confidence in Dubai’s evolving transport infrastructure.Together, the Dubai Metro Blue Line and the new marine stations reflect a city-wide push to create a seamlessly integrated, multimodal transport network. These upgrades are not only addressing current mobility needs but are also being built with future urban growth and sustainability in mind. The RTA is also exploring smart technologies to enhance real-time connectivity and improve overall commuter experience across the transport network.As work progresses, the RTA continues to advise residents and commuters to stay informed about diversions and changes, and to plan travel in advance. Whether by rail or water, Dubai’s transport infrastructure is moving swiftly toward a more connected, efficient, and accessible future.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Feud at Diana’s grave: Prince William and Prince Harry split over mother's 30th death anniversary films,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/feud-at-dianas-grave-prince-william-and-prince-harry-split-over-mothers-30th-death-anniversary-films/articleshow/123608238.cms,"Prince Harry's Fears Confirmed With Royal Family's Prince George Move? Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

"‘Closing a chapter, opening a New One’: Kavin Mittal confirms global shutdown of Hike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/closing-a-chapter-opening-a-new-one-kavin-mittal-confirms-global-shutdown-of-hike/articleshow/123870695.cms,"Read Kavin Bharti Mittal’s complete LinkedIn post here:



After regrouping with our investors and the team, I’ve made the difficult decision to wind down Hike completely.

Our US business, launched just nine months ago, is off to a strong start. But after the

India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.

The Big Question → We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for? For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors. Why?

RMG was never the destination. It was a way to test unit economics and traction in India while working toward a bigger vision. In hindsight, starting in India locked us into the model and regulatory headwinds, turning a temporary path into a more permanent one. The Gaming Nation vision is real, but we may be too early. The world will eventually move toward a Nation-type model in gaming and Web3 - Company 2.0. But crypto regulation is still developing globally, and we don’t want to repeat India, where we hoped for clarity that never came. And most importantly, if doing a full reset, is this where I’d put my own capital and energy today? For the first time, the answer is no. The world has changed in the last decade - and so have I. There are more important problems to solve and bigger opportunities to deploy brilliant talent and capital.

Looking Back & Lessons

The last 13 years have been immense. Hike Messenger reached 40M MAUs and became the 35th most loved consumer brand in India at its peak. With Rush, we built a new kind of Casual PvP gaming platform and scaled it to 10M users and $500M+ in gross revenue ( CEA ) in just 4 years.

Our execution was super, but we could never quite make it stick. There are clear lessons to carry forward, especially on market selection:

Be careful with winner-take-all markets. To win, you need to go global. Don’t build for today’s constraints. Build on the spring/summer of new technologies. Regulatory clarity matters. Risk is fine; uncertainty is not.

More importantly momentum is everything. And build what your heart and mind are deeply excited about. It’s the conviction that carries you through.

This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger.

To everyone who has been part of this journey - our users, our team, our investors, and our community - thank you. As a CEO, you’re only as strong as your team, and I want to give a special shout-out to mine - an incredible group of people who gave this everything

.

This chapter ends, but the climb continues.

Looking Forward

I’ve always thrived at building at the forefront of technology. Over the last decade, in the little time I had to explore outside of Hike, I kept returning to the same three frontiers. And now, they feel like the great canvases for decades to come →

AI → For the first time, technology has both intelligence and memory. Imagine products that don’t just serve us functionally but truly know us - systems that adapt, grow, and partner with us. As a UX-first builder, this is the most exciting time to be building software. Breakthroughs in Energy → Human progress has always been bound by energy. The world’s demand for energy is rising faster than ever. Breakthrough approaches, especially in physics are needed to power the future. The last century gave us mastery of fine matters and electricity, the next will move deeper, at the intersection of science and spirituality - into what yogis call divine magnetism and physicists call the quantum world or electromagnetism. From there will come technologies that today feel impossible to imagine. Mastery of the Self → As AI takes on more of our work, a deeper question will rise: what now defines us? When productivity is no longer the measure of worth, humanity will turn inward. Man’s evolution will move from the intellect to intuitive attunement - a deeper connection with ourselves and the divine (which we’ll realise are one and the same). The tools, spaces, and guides that help us explore this inner world will be as transformative as any innovation in the outer one - unlocking the next level of humanity’s potential

If you put these together, a picture emerges: → the cost of intelligence trending to zero → the cost of energy trending to zero → and the cost of willpower falling lower and lower.

Just imagine a future where willpower is infinite, energy is abundant, and intelligence is at our fingertips.

This is the future I will help build — and it’s where I’ll be contributing in the decades to come. This new chapter will look very different from the last one

Kavin Bharti Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike has announced that the popular gaming and messaging app is shutting down. In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal announced that app is shutting down globally. In a reflective post titled “Closing a Chapter, Opening a New One”, Mittal cited shifting market dynamics and regulatory challenges as key reasons behind the decision.The shut down of Hike is followed by the recent online real-money gaming ban imposed by the Indian government. Hike pivoted from its original messaging app to real money gaming in 2021. Mittal acknowledged that after the imposed ban it was not the best decision to keep on investing in the platform.Once regarded as a WhatsApp rival, Hike attracted millions of users and was backed by investors like Tecent and Softbank.In his LinkedIn post, Mittal expressed gratitude to the team and community, writing: “We gave it everything we had. We learned, we grew, and now it’s time to move on.” He also hinted at future ventures, saying he’s “excited to build again”.","Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike, has announced the company will be shutting down.
