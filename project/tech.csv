Fans Speculate Travis Hunter And His Fiancee, Leanna Lenee, Are “Happy” To Be Not In The Spotlight Anymore Due To Joy Taylor



Travis Hunter And Leanna Lenee Continue To Maintain A Low Profile



Travis Hunter, the college football athlete has received extreme amounts of hate and criticism as people brutally judged his fiancee, Leanna Lenee. But now it looks like fans have dragged Travis’ fiancee into the Joy Taylor controversy. Many fans speculate that Travis and his fiancee, Leanna Lenee, are now “relieved” that the spotlight has moved away from them and is now focused on Fox Sports host Joy Taylor.Travis and his would-be wife Leanna Lenee have been at the eye of the storm for the last couple of weeks as fans uncovered many “controversial” statements, pictures and videos of Leanna. Leanna has been brutally trolled by fans as fans continue to speculate that Leanna is with Travis only because of his wealth and fame even though both Travis and her have continued to slam such criticisms.Now fans believe since the attention has all been diverted towards Fox Sports and especially Fox Sports host Joy Taylor, Travis and Leanna must be “really happy”. A fan took to X and wrote, “Nobody is happier for the Joy Taylor news than Travis Hunter’s girlfriend”, another fan shared the same sentiment and wrote on X, “Travis Hunter and his girlfriend could not be more grateful for Joy Taylor.”In the last few days, there has been a lot of controversy around the Fox Sports host Joy Taylor and how she has enabled sexual misconduct at Fox Sports. Joy Taylor is not the only one accused by a former hairstylist at Fox Sports and many big names are involved currently.As per the Daily Mail, the former hairstylist has accused many big names at Fox Sports who have behaved inappropriately with her. She has also revealed that when she approached Joy Taylor with the accusations, she was brushed off. Joy Taylor has been also accused of using sexual favours to achieve promotions at her workplace. Ex NFL legend Emmanuel Acho has also been named as providing Joy Taylor with career advancement opportunities in exchange of sexual favours.Joy Taylor, Emmanuel Acho and others have maintained silence but Fox released a statement that said, “We take these allegations seriously and will allow the legal process to run its course. We have no further comment at this time.”It seems like Travis and his fiancee Leanna have been unnecessarily dragged into a controversy that has nothing to do with them. Neither Travis nor Leanna have spoken up about this and continue to maintain a low profile both on social media and in public.At the Alamo Bowl, Travis has been accused of ignoring his fans as he walked with his fiancee Leanna Lenee. This seems pretty odd of Travis who has always been known for interacting with his fans.Also Read: Travis Hunter caught in drama as rapper calls Leanna Lenee 'not authentic' and predicts Travis will change after the NFL, sparking wild fan reactions","Fans speculate that Travis Hunter and his fiancee, Leanna Lenee, are “relieved” that the spotlight has moved away from them and is now focused on Fox Sports host Joy Taylor.

In reports, it is mentioned that he was met with chants laden with profanity. Evidently, fans were not thrilled to see the legendary “Hulkster” in the Inuit Dome and booed during his segment. Ringside News took to X (Twitter) to ask whether people were surprised to see such vehement opposition to Hulk Hogan’s appearance.As the camera panned across the audience, one could see that thumbs were pointed down and the booing intensified throughout his product plug as he attempted to promote his beer brand with longtime manager Jimmy Hart. As the two tried to garner and generate hype within the audience, it became clear that the Hulkster’s public image had taken a major hit in recent years.Fan responseWhile fans responded with humorous gifs on social media posts about Hogan getting booed, they also took to social media themselves in implying that Hulk Hogan getting booed off of stage was warranted.laughed @bypapijuan, as @Jay1ean added: ‘I LOVE seeing Hulk Hogan get boo’d #RawOnNetflix’ In the same breath @ThomasTParker quipped:which clearly implies that fans were neither surprised nor did they think that the booing was offhanded when it came to Hulk Hogan.Also read:Hogan was fired from WWE in 2015 after a recording of him using the N-word became public during a sex tape lawsuit he filed against Gawker magazine and was later brought back by the board in 2018 after apologizing for his comments leaked in the 2015 trial, describing the scandal as a ‘speed bump’ as recently as last year.The WWE universe has, therefore, been unforgiving to Hulk Hogan which became evident off-camera yesterday during his short stint in front of the American flag.","WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan made his Netflix debut on January 6.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media’s treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered—or neglected.One of Goodwin’s main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC’s coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media’s reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK’s media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk’s influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What’s being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it’s time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, “Find the truth and tell us the truth. That’s your job.”","British political scientist Matthew James Goodwin analyzed media coverage from 2011 to 2025. Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs.

In November 2021, the woman was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. The doctors initially told her the focus would be on prolonging her life rather than finding a cure.Despite the grim prediction, a combined range of treatments including chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, and surgery helped her defy the odds leaving no signs of cancer anywhere in her body.""Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.” Perea shared, adding, ""To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.According to Sky News, Pera's cancer was diagnosed after she first visited a GP in Wingan, reporting symptoms of constipation and bloating. Following a series of tests, including a colonoscopy and biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed, revealing that the cancer had spread to all eight segments of her liver.Perea underwent 37 rounds of chemotherapy with the targeted drug panitumumab, showing an excellent response that allowed surgeons to remove her bowel tumour in May 2023. However, tumours remained in her liver, which were initially inoperable. However, after the positive reaction to treatment, doctors began exploring liver transplantation as an option.In February 2024, she was added to the transplant list and fortunately found a donor last summer.Her oncologist, Dr Kalena Marti, praised the outcome, ""When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.”""This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.""Dr Marti also highlighted the importance of ongoing research and the generosity of organ donors. ""Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. As a result, it's important that we continue to develop new treatments.","Bianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Manchester, has been declared cancer-free.

A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit. Deployment: Operated by a crew of 95 soldiers, the system is rapidly deployable and designed to protect against evolving missile threats both within and outside the atmosphere.

The United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was deployed in Israel to intercept a Houthi ballistic missile launched from Yemen, Times of Israel reported. This marks the first operational use of the advanced missile defence system since its deployment to Israel in October. Footage shared on social media captured the dramatic launch of a THAAD interceptor, with an American soldier exclaiming, ""Eighteen years I’ve been waiting for this.""The missile, reportedly targeting Israel, was neutralised by air defence systems. However, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have not specified whether the interception was achieved by the American THAAD or an Israeli system. According to sources cited by Reuters, an analysis is underway to determine the success of the THAAD system.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network. Designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, THAAD employs “hit-to-kill” technology, where interceptors physically collide with incoming missiles to destroy them. This approach minimises collateral damage and maximises precision.Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1990s, THAAD has undergone significant testing and enhancements. The US Army currently operates seven THAAD batteries, with deployments in strategic locations such as Guam and South Korea, and most recently, Israel.","The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham’s temperature as “balmy,” saying, “The corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.”Guests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as “so compact.”In Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a “peaceful and happy new life.” Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. “It’s just like a big family like I always wanted,” she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‘No boisterous behavior’

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions “claustrophobic.”Speaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. “Diana hated Sandringham,” Seward said. “Even when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn’t like it… I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn’t want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they’re not rules. They’re just traditions of royalty.” Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana’s experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.“It was highly fraught,” Diana told Morton. “I know I gave, but I can’t remember being a receiver. Isn’t that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.” Diana added, “I sure was [an outsider].”Seward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana’s disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. “She just couldn’t understand [it],” Seward said. “To her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.”Despite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana “hated going to Sandringham for Christmas,” mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a “command performance.” An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana’s experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana’s gift-giving experience was “embarrassing and painful,” as she wasn’t aware of the family’s gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange “silly joke presents,” with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles’ favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

What do you think?”A community note on X later debunked some of the claims, clarifying, “This photo is old. It’s from a November 2024 photo dump. Also, the swimsuit isn’t $2K—new Dior swim is approximately $1K, but resale prices are much lower.”Welch, who gained fame last year with her viral catchphrase and later started a podcast, has not addressed the rumors. Her silence has only fueled speculation among fans. Welch’s name became controversial when she pivoted into cryptocurrency and NFTs , facing accusations of orchestrating a scam and engaging in insider trading—allegations she has consistently denied.Adding intrigue to Welch’s story is her previously revealed mystery boyfriend, “Pookie,” whose real name is Kelby Blackwell , a plumber. Despite the swirling rumors, Welch has remained out of the public eye for weeks, leaving fans and critics to speculate about her next move.","Hailey Welch, the 22-year-old internet sensation behind the viral "" Hawk Tuah "" clip, is once again in the spotlight.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?



Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Lobbying in SF city doesn’t stop us from getting justices.

We demand FBi investigation

@elonmusk @VivekGRamaswamy @GavinNewsom @MEA

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.
