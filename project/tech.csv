Swiss roots and the passion for watches

Journey from a collector to the Swiss mogul

Roman Josi is known as the calm, cool captain of the Nashville Predators, well known for his consistency, leadership, and defensive play. Along with his way to become the finest captain in Nashville Predators’ history, Josi has built his reputation with his perfect timing, proper gameplay under pressure and smart decision-making as aleader.Besides his career as a sportsman, Roman Josi is also passionate about something totally different from his niche, which is watchmaking or collecting luxury watches. Though he is not a businessman, seeing his enthusiasm towards collecting watches, his fans named him ‘a Swiss watch mogul’.Switzerland is a place where watches are not just another accessory; they symbolise the country's rich cultural heritage. Swiss watchmaking is something more than a hobby, it is linked with precision, patience, and long-term thinking capacity about something. Born and brought up in Switzerland, Josi is already the root of watchmaking in his veins, adding to it his professional career as a hockey player. Josi is one of the seven men who hold shares of NORQAIN, an independent Swiss watchmaking brand.He became a significant investor in the company in 2018, from the initial phase of the brand. Founded by Ben Küffer of the Küffer family, a family with more than 40 years of experience in watchmaking, NORQAIN provides a wide range of luxury watches.Josi’s vast collection also includes some pieces from NORQAIN.He owns NORQAIN Wild ONE Skeleton in grey colour (high performing sports watch), NORQAIN Wild ONE NHLPA Limited Edition (a specialised timepiece, limited edition ), Freedom 60 Chrono (vintage styles blending classic design with sporty details). These are some of the significant watches in Josi's NORQAIN collection.Over time, the Roman Josi has been seen wearing his classic pieces, which reflect his choice of elegance over trends. Josi mostly leans towards brands with heritage, which offer classic designs, clean dials, and elegant looks. This shows his love for the craftsmanship of watchmaking and reflects his personality as a confident individual. As his career in the NHL grew, so did his collection of watches. Every piece he wears in different events is praiseworthy, be it a formal event or a family holiday; he has his watches for all occasions. The watches work as a symbol for all the milestones he achieved in his career and in his life.The passion for collecting sophisticated watch pieces is what makes Josi stand out from others. In a world where sportsmen are intent on being trendy, which eventually helps them grow through brand endorsements, Josi chose his fascination with watches, which is rare. Over the years, the way he showcases those graceful timepieces on his wrist has overwhelmed fans, who also become curious about watchmaking.The phrase Swiss watch mogul, is not just any other nickname he gets because of his game; rather, it implies his subtle, disciplined, and decent way to support a craft, a heritage with a rich history of his own country, without being loud. Josi doesn't have a brand, but he represents how classic pieces never lost their charm, and everyone should carry forward these antiquities; in this way, he became an unofficial brand ambassador of Swiss watch culture.","Roman Josi is the captain of the Nashville Predators hockey team.

The network airs an NFL Films “Road to the Super Bowl” special at noon ET, then a five-hour Super Bowl LX pregame show starting at 1 p.m. ET, all leading into Patriots vs. Seahawks at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, and Universo.For most fans, this is what your setup looks like:If you are watching in the UK, kickoff is set for 11:30 p.m. GMT on Sunday night.

If you are only staying up for the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, you can afford to skip the first half, then jump in a little after 1 a.m. on Channel 5 or Sky.This is the Bad Bunny show as much as it is Patriots vs. Seahawks.

This time, the stage is his, even if he refuses to spill details. Asked about surprise guests, he shrugged it off with “You know that’s something that I not gonna tell you” and kept the guest list locked down.The choice has also lit up the political crowd. Donald Trump has already said he will not attend after Bad Bunny and Green Day, who both oppose his politics, were chosen. He called the decision “a terrible choice” and said “I’m anti-them. All it does is sow hatred.” That is the climate around this halftime show before a single snap is played.If you are the type who watches Super Bowl Sunday like an awards show, the music lineup is loaded before Bad Bunny ever walks out.Here is the core list for Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8:On top of the TV talent, NBC’s game broadcast will feature Mike Tirico on play-by-play, Cris Collinsworth in the booth, Melissa Stark and Kaylee Hartung on the sidelines, and Terry McAulay handling rules analysis.So if your group chat is split between Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold talk and people who only care about Bad Bunny, Charlie Puth, and Green Day, this game is built for both sides.

Oracle's Larry Ellison has lost almost $50 billion this year in less than forty days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracles-larry-ellison-has-lost-almost-50-billion-this-year-in-less-than-forty-days/articleshow/127967875.cms,"Ellison was not alone other tech leaders also hit hard

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Maya Higa reacts in disbelief as her laughing face spreads across Twitch





Maya Higa did not wake up expecting to question her own internet legacy. Yet during a recent February livestream, the Twitch creator stumbled onto a discovery that left her staring at chat in disbelief. For years, an animated laughing emote built from her face has been circulating across Twitch through the 7TV extension. The twist is simple and shocking. She had no idea it was being used far beyond her own channel.The moment unfolded live. Higa noticed her face pop up in another streamer’s clip and paused. “I saw a clip from Julia’s stream and I saw my face in it,” she explained on stream. “I was like, ‘wait, I thought that was just me because it’s my channel.’” What she assumed was an inside joke within her community had quietly spread to thousands of channels.As viewers filled her chat with explanations, the scale of the situation became clear. The emote, hosted through 7TV, is reportedly enabled in more than 4,000 Twitch channels. That number alone was enough to leave her stunned. The animated “lmao” reaction, which features her laughing expression, had effectively taken on a life of its own.Her chat defended it as iconic. Higa disagreed. “It’s not even good,” she remarked. “It’s not even a good emote. I feel like that’s not a good one… is this my claim to fame?” The comment drew laughs, but it also highlighted a deeper issue that creators increasingly face on platforms like Twitch. Third party extensions allow images and inside jokes to travel fast. Sometimes they travel without clear permission.Still, Higa chose not to escalate the situation. After processing the surprise, she softened her reaction. “Is that not crazy? Why?” she said, before shrugging it off. “If people like it, I’m glad.”Her response reflects the complicated balance streamers walk today. Digital culture moves quickly. Memes spread faster than their origins. For Maya Higa, what began as a personal emote quietly evolved into a cross channel staple. And she only found out by accident, live in front of thousands watching.","Maya Higa was stunned to discover that an animated laughing emote featuring her face has been widely used across Twitch via 7TV for years.

How Google DeepMind's Genie 3 model can help Waymo



""no substitute""

""can simulate virtually any scene.""

Waymo is using DeepMind's Genie 3 artificial intelligence (AI) model to create realistic digital environments where its autonomous vehicles can train on rare and difficult driving scenarios. The Alphabet-owned self-driving company recently published a blog post announcing its new Waymo World Model. This AI model is built on Genie 3's ability to construct virtual environments from text prompts. The system generates synthetic driving footage and depth perception data, as if captured by vehicle-mounted cameras and lidar sensors.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Waymo spokesperson said,and the new world modelWaymo's system can also convert real-life dashcam datasets into scenes and depth maps for vehicle simulations. The company said this combination will make its autonomous vehicle systems more reliable in uncommon scenarios and help expand Waymo's self-driving services across more markets.the spokeswoman added.Last week, Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 model gained major attention with demonstrations of its world-building capabilities. This also triggered a sell-off in companies that provide game development and graphics creation tools.By incorporating Google's Genie 3 model, Waymo could gain momentum for its plans to expand to about a dozen cities this year. Simulation is just one tool it uses to prepare its autonomous systems for specific situations and validate their safety, the spokesperson noted.In December 2025, the company said there isfor its real-world driving experience. Recently, Alphabet reported Waymo had surpassed 20 million autonomous trips that month.However, the company spokesperson declined to comment on whether it has conducted simulations of stopped school bus encounters or mass power outages, such as the one that disrupted its San Francisco operations last year. Yet, she noted the Waymo World ModelWaymo is currently facing safety probes from US authorities after a series of software mishaps in recent months. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating multiple incidents in which Waymo failed to stop for parked school buses in Austin. These violations have also prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall of its software.Beyond Waymo, other robotaxi operators and AI companies have been seeking additional data sources to improve their models. Nvidia, which supplies chips and AI models for developers of self-driving technology, has partnered with ride-hailing company Uber to collect millions of hours of robotaxi-specific driving data to fuel driverless model training and validation.SoftBank Group-backed Wayve, which plans to trial robotaxis on the Uber platform in the UK this year, has announced its own world model to generate synthetic driving data. Elon Musk ’s Tesla has also said that it has built a similar simulator.

What is Pilloo AI launched for small business owners, and what is it all about



How Pilloo AI aims to change small business life



How Piloo AI works



Record daily sales.

Track payments.

Get balance sheets.

Automate purchase entries and bank transactions.

In India, millions of small business owners are reportedly held back by complex systems and paperwork. But now, this new AI may help small business owners to stage for a future where businesses run on conversation rather than forms and screens. It might also accelerate India’s digital economy, particularly in smaller towns and cities where leaning to technological based might be slower.Pilloo AI, reportedly the country’s first voice-based billing and accounting agent, was officially launched in Andhra Pradesh . The event had Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in attendance, along with top bureaucrats, local politicians, and the Pilloo AI team.No more fiddling with complicated software and no more staring at spreadsheets. Instead, business owners can now just talk, ask for invoices, check reports, and even record transactions all in their own language.Pilloo AI is an AI-powered billing and accounting platform developed by Pilloo AI Private Limited, headquartered in Andhra Pradesh. It is designed specifically for small and medium businesses that often struggle with complicated software and manual bookkeeping.The tool lets business owners do a lot just by speaking. You can create invoices, record daily transactions, track payments, fetch reports, and even manage balance sheets.It also automates purchase entries and bank transactions.Interestingly, it works through natural conversation. You don’t need accounting knowledge, rather your own language. Currently, this knows 5 Indian languages, with plans to expand to over 50 globally.For decades, small businesses relied on pen, paper, or clunky software. Many owners still keep manual records, especially in smaller towns. Ram Mohan, co-founder of Pilloo AI, reportedly said it’s about breaking that barrier. “We wanted something anyone could use. No screens, no paperwork, no fear,” he mentioned.The launch event at the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat was reportedly lively. CS Vijayanand, MLA Prathipati Pulla Rao, Muthavarapu Suresh, and investors of Pilloo AI were present. Naidu himself apparently highlighted how tools like this make life easier for entrepreneurs and promote digital growth.Sai Praneeth G, founder of Pilloo AI, explained the platform helps business owners in very simple ways.But experts caution that AI isn’t perfect. Errors can happen, such as mishearing numbers or missing a transaction. Still, early tests reportedly show the platform is surprisingly accurate.","Pilloo AI is an AI-powered billing and accounting platform developed by Pilloo AI Private Limited, headquartered in Andhra Pradesh.

Weather in UAE today





Early morning alert

Why this weather pattern?





Dubai and parts of the UAE are under a weather pattern that brings light rain and cloudy skies, especially in the early hours of the morning. Local forecasters including the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) have forecast light rainfall on Friday, February 6, 2026, with some coastal and inland areas seeing droplets or short showers.This comes as part of a broader unstable weather system, influenced by shifts in pressure and cloud cover building over the region, which increases the chance of rain, especially in northern and eastern parts of the UAE.Today’s daytime conditions in Dubai are expected to be fair to partly cloudy, with a pleasant high of around 26 °C and a low at night near 17–18 °C.As night approaches, humidity levels will rise, particularly over coastal areas and islands. This overnight increase in moisture raises the likelihood of fog or mist formation, which can make early morning visibility challenging for drivers and pedestrians.Winds will be light to moderate, generally from southeasterly to northeasterly directions at around 10–20 km/hr, with occasional gusts reaching up to about 30 km/hr, which might stir patches of moisture and keep the skies feeling cool and breezy.According to the latest satellite imagery from the NCM, the most consistent rainfall is predicted for Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.However, the ""heavy hitters"" are expected in the mountainous regions of Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, where the terrain naturally pushes clouds higher, leading to more concentrated downpours.In Dubai, the rain is likely to be ""intermittent,"" meaning you might experience a quick burst of heavy rain followed by a lull. For those in Abu Dhabi, the weather will remain mostly cloudy with a lower chance of direct rainfall compared to their northern neighbors.One of the biggest weather talking points for today is visibility concerns early in the morning. Because of increased humidity and the cooler night temperatures, the NCM predicts fog or mist formation across parts of Dubai and neighbouring emirates, especially in areas near the coast and low-lying districts.This morning fog could affect traffic visibility on major roads, so authorities and media outlets are advising residents to drive with caution, reduce speeds, and use headlights in foggy conditions.The recent forecasts from weather news services and the NCM highlight a trend that has been developing since earlier this week: spells of partly cloudy weather with intermittent rain chances and increasing humidity at night.Across the UAE, cloud cover has increased, bringing lighter showers and thicker skies over inland and some northern regions.

Top red flags of fake job offers in the Gulf



Requests for money upfront: Genuine employers never ask job seekers to pay for visas, training, processing fees or medical exams as a condition of employment. Any request for money should be treated as a scam indicator.

Genuine employers never ask job seekers to pay for visas, training, processing fees or medical exams as a condition of employment. Any request for money should be treated as a scam indicator. Unverified or free email addresses: Legitimate companies use official business domains in their emails, not free services like Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail. If the recruiter’s contact looks generic, that is a warning sign.

How job scams are evolving in the Gulf: AI and bots



Official advice: How to protect yourself against job scams in the Gulf



Verify every job offer:



Use the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) platforms to confirm a job offer’s validity. For work visas, use official government channels like GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) or ICP’s eChannels in the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, check with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) or relevant Saudi government recruitment verification systems.

Never pay fees to recruiters



Check the company’s legitimacy



Use official communication channels



Retain records



What to do if you encounter a job scam in the Gulf



Stop all communication immediately.

Report the scam to local authorities such as Dubai Police’s eCrime platform or the relevant law enforcement agency in your area.

Contact your embassy or consulate for help verifying job offers from abroad.

Share warnings with friends and networks to prevent others from falling victim.

Most companies today don’t post jobs to hire.

They post jobs to collect data and train their AI.

As the Gulf continues to attract millions of job seekers, from local professionals to expatriates and international applicants, fraudulent job offers and fake recruitment schemes have become a persistent problem in the UAE and Saudi Arabia . These scams have grown more sophisticated, leveraging social media, messaging apps and even AI-powered bots to deceive applicants into losing money or exposing their personal information.Sweat not as we spill the beans on how these scams work, what the authorities are warning about and the practical steps you can take to stay safe.Dubai, Abu Dhabi in the UAE and other Gulf cities including Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, are magnets for global talent because of their diverse economies and high demand for skilled workers. Unfortunately, fraudsters exploit this demand by posting fake job ads that promise high salaries, minimal experience requirements and even immediate work visas.These tactics can trap unsuspecting applicants into giving up money, documents or personal data without ever receiving a legitimate job offer. Authorities have noted that the scammers use a wide range of channels, from social media and job boards to WhatsApp, Telegram and email, to make their offers look official, often using real company names or logos to lend credibility.Understanding common warning signs is one of the best defenses against job scams. Experts and police advisories in the UAE emphasise the following red flags -Recent reports highlight that fraudsters are increasingly using AI-powered bots to automate the creation of thousands of fake listings that look legitimate at first glance.These bots can even carry out simple “interviews” via automated chat before handing applicants over to human fraudsters. This makes spotting scams even harder without careful verification.Authorities in Dubai and across the UAE have issued clear guidance to job seekers on how to stay safe -Genuine employers cover visa processing and recruitment costs; if you are asked to pay any charges, it is likely a scam.Research the company’s name, trade licence information and official website. Using official registries like the UAE’s National Economic Register can help confirm legitimacy.Always prefer communication via official email addresses or company phone numbers listed on corporate websites — and avoid ad hoc WhatsApp or social media chats.Keep all correspondence, offer letters, screenshots and names in case you need to report or investigate suspicious activity.If you suspect a job offer or agent is fake:Police and labour authorities are actively cracking down on fraud; in fact, over 1,300 companies were fined AED 34 million for fake job practices in 2025 as part of a broader enforcement effort. Job scams in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, from fake offers to fraudulent visa promises, pose real risks to job seekers. With fraudsters becoming more sophisticated and using tactics like AI bots and social media deception, it is more important than ever to stay vigilant.By learning the warning signs, verifying offers through official channels and never paying upfront fees, applicants can protect themselves and make informed career decisions in one of the Gulf’s most competitive job markets.","Job scams have become a persistent problem in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

$8 million for a cameo? MrBeast’s reported Super Bowl deal with Salesforce sparks backlash and big questions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/8-million-for-a-cameo-mrbeasts-reported-super-bowl-deal-with-salesforce-sparks-backlash-and-big-questions/articleshow/127976245.cms,"Salesforce reportedly paid around $8 million to give MrBeast full creative control over its Super Bowl commercial. The partnership began after the YouTuber publicly shared his long-held idea for a Super Bowl ad. While the move aims to tap into authenticity and massive online reach, critics question the spending amid past layoffs and corporate priorities.

Inside Mrbeast & Thea Booysen's Heartfelt Engagement Pics | Net Worth, Businesses & More | WATCH

Why Salesforce trusted MrBeast with the spotlight





Salesforce did not just buy a Super Bowl slot. It reportedly bought belief. The enterprise software giant is said to have paid around $8 million to bring MrBeast into its Super Bowl campaign, handing him full creative control in the process. That figure alone has turned heads across the NFL and marketing worlds. For a company already known for massive advertising spend, this move feels less like a standard endorsement and more like a calculated gamble on influence.The story began weeks earlier when MrBeast publicly floated his ambition. “I've been sitting on an amazing Super Bowl commercial idea for years. I know it’s random but someone please let me make your brand's Super Bowl commercial so I can finally make this idea happen 🙏🏻” What looked like a casual post quickly evolved into one of the boldest brand collaborations tied to Super Bowl LX.Super Bowl commercials often rely on polished scripts and famous faces. Salesforce appears to have chosen a different path. Instead of forcing a message, it reportedly stepped back and let the world’s most-watched YouTuber shape the narrative. That decision matters.Enterprise buyers are not robots. They scroll. They binge content. They skip ads that feel stiff. By giving MrBeast the wheel, Salesforce tapped into a creator whose audience trusts him because he feels real.His videos rarely look like ads, even when they are. That trust carries weight in a crowded attention economy.Marc Benioff fueled the buzz with another public post: “Seahawks vs Patriots + MrBeast directing our ad with a $1M giveaway? This Super Bowl is gonna be EPIC! ❤️🏈#SuperBowlLX #SalesforceAI #MrBeast” The promise of a million dollar giveaway added spectacle to an already high stakes game.Still, critics have raised eyebrows. Salesforce has faced scrutiny over layoffs while investing heavily in celebrity partnerships. The contrast has sparked debate about priorities. Yet from a branding perspective, the logic is clear. In today’s market, credibility is currency.If the reported $8 million figure proves accurate, Salesforce did not simply purchase airtime. It invested in relevance. And during the Super Bowl, relevance is everything.","Salesforce reportedly paid around $8 million to give MrBeast full creative control over its Super Bowl commercial.

Kuwait Prepares 1,700 Mosques for Ramadan 2026: Safety, Comfort and Community Focus

In the UAE, preparations at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre include expanded parking and transport services ahead of Ramadan to serve millions of visitors.

In Saudi Arabia , ministries issue pre-Ramadan guidelines to ensure mosques and prayer halls nationwide are ready and staffed throughout the month.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches, Kuwait is entering a phase of intense preparation, not only spiritually but also logistically to ensure that Muslim worshippers can observe prayers comfortably and safely. Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs has announced that around 1,700 mosques across the country’s six governorates are being readied to welcome congregations for Taraweeh (night prayers) and other Ramadan rites.The Islamic month of Ramadan is woven into social and community life in Kuwait and governments are mobilising resources to uphold religious traditions while prioritising public safety and convenience. According to reports, the Ministry is finalising maintenance and service work at nearly 1,700 mosques to ensure they are fully equipped for the influx of worshippers during Ramadan. The work includes:Maintenance teams will be on duty around the clock throughout Ramadan this year, to address issues immediately and ensure mosques remain accessible and comfortable for all worshippers.Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs is not just preparing physical spaces, it is also working in tandem with other government bodies to provide a holistic experience for worshippers during the holy month:These measures reflect a growing emphasis on not just welcoming worshippers but also ensuring their well-being and dignity during intense spiritual practice, particularly in high-capacity mosques during Taraweeh and Laylat al-Qadr.Ramadan is much more than fasting from dawn to sunset. It is a month of communal gathering, prayer, reflection and charity. Mosques become epicenters of social and spiritual life, hosting night prayers, Quran recitations, charitable distribution and community iftars. The prep work underway in Kuwait underscores the importance of mosques as community anchors.Clean, safe, well-organised prayer spaces boost participation in congregational prayers, especially for elders and families and make it easier for people across age groups to engage in the spiritual rhythm of Ramadan. Kuwait is not alone in ramping up preparations for Ramadan worshippers. Across the Gulf, ministries and religious affairs departments are undertaking similar efforts.These coordinated activities reflect a shared regional priority of preserving Ramadan as a deeply religious, safe and communal experience for all Muslims. With the month of Ramadan nearly upon the region, Kuwait’s extensive preparations of covering 1,700 mosques, safety planning, infrastructure servicing and cross-agency coordination are setting the stage for a spiritually rich and orderly observance. These efforts demonstrate how government planning and community engagement come together to support traditions that are central to cultural and religious life during the holy month.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs is finalising maintenance and service work at nearly 1,700 mosques to ensure they are fully equipped for the influx of worshippers during Ramadan.

Dubai set to adopt China’s ‘Sponge City’ model — What the future city could look like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-set-to-adopt-chinas-sponge-city-model-what-the-future-city-could-look-like/articleshow/127900886.cms,"Inside the Sponge City Vision Set to Reshape Urban Life / Image: AI

What is China’s Sponge City?



What Sponge City could offer in Dubai?

Roads and pavements designed to absorb water instead of repelling it

Parks, plazas, and landscaped areas that temporarily store rainwater during storms

Green roofs and shaded corridors that reduce heat while managing runoff

Underground water storage systems beneath urban zones for reuse in irrigation

Smart, AI-driven monitoring systems to predict rainfall and manage drainage loads

Dubai–Shenzhen Partnership

Commute for all







In a major move toward climate resilience, Dubai has officially embraced the ""Sponge City"" urban model through a landmark partnership with the Chinese tech hub, Shenzhen. Announced during the World Governments Summit (WGS) 2026, this collaboration aims to transform how the emirate handles heavy rainfall.A ""Sponge City"" is designed to act just like its name suggests, rather than letting water pool on asphalt or overwhelm traditional sewers, the city uses permeable pavements, rooftop gardens, and specialized wetlands to absorb, store, and purify rainwater. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shenzhen, a world leader in this field, Dubai is bringing in decades of expertise to ensure its streets remain dry and functional even during the most intense desert storms.China introduced sponge cities to tackle flooding, water scarcity, and urban overheating caused by rapid concrete-heavy development. In Shenzhen, the model combines permeable roads, green roofs, rain gardens, wetlands, underground reservoirs, and smart drainage systems into a single, integrated urban ecosystem.Rather than relying solely on pipes and pumps, sponge cities use nature-based solutions supported by technology.Water is absorbed where it falls, stored temporarily during heavy rain, filtered naturally, and reused for irrigation or cooling.Dubai officials see this as a practical model to adapt, especially as climate patterns shift and short bursts of heavy rainfall become more frequent across the region.This initiative is a critical pillar of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, which focuses on enhancing the quality of life and doubling the city’s green areas. The partnership with Shenzhen will see the development of ""Rain Gardens"" and ""Bio-Swell"" zones, beautifully landscaped areas that double as natural drainage systems.City planners envision:His Excellency Dawoud Al Hajri, Director General of Dubai Municipality, emphasized that this isn't just about disaster prevention; it’s about urban aesthetics. By integrating nature into the drainage strategy, Dubai will see more parks and tree-lined streets that naturally cool the city while managing water.The agreement between Dubai Municipality and UPDIS sets out cooperation in urban planning, sponge city development, smart technologies, low-carbon growth, and future-ready city design.Dubai Municipality Director General Eng. Marwan Ahmed bin Ghalita said the partnership reflects Dubai’s strategy of learning from global leaders while developing cities that are sustainable, resilient, and people-centric. Shenzhen’s UPDIS President Yu Lu noted that both cities share similarities, young, fast-growing, and innovation-driven, making collaboration especially effective.The partnership includes research exchange, technical cooperation, and annual progress reviews, ensuring the sponge city concept is adapted carefully to Dubai’s environment and long-term plans.For the average resident, ""Sponge City"" technology means no more waterlogged roads, reduced traffic delays during the rainy season, and a significant boost in local greenery. By utilizing the Shenzhen model, Dubai is positioning itself as a global leader in desert urbanism.As H.E. Abdulla Al Basti, Secretary General of the Dubai Executive Council, noted, this partnership reflects the city’s commitment to ""proactive governance"", solving future problems today through global cooperation and high-tech engineering.","Dubai has officially embraced the ""Sponge City"" urban model through a landmark partnership with the Chinese tech hub, Shenzhen.

Gallery with café? Artist Daniel Arsham opens new art-driven coffee and dessert restaurant in Dubai Mall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gallery-with-caf-artist-daniel-arsham-opens-new-art-driven-coffee-and-dessert-restaurant-in-dubai-mall/articleshow/127899993.cms,"Daniel's Room Dubai Mall: Art, Coffee and Desserts Fusion in Fashion Avenue

What is Daniel’s Room? More than a café in Dubai Mall



Strategic location of Daniel Arsham's cafe and its cultural relevance







Dubai’s culinary and cultural landscape just got a bold new addition with the launch of Daniel’s Room at Dubai Mall’s Fashion Avenue, a space where specialty coffee, limited-edition desserts and contemporary art coexist under one roof. The concept, created by artist Daniel Arsham, has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about openings in the city’s dynamic food and lifestyle scene.Unlike traditional restaurants or dessert spots, Daniel’s Room is designed as an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element, from the furniture and lighting to tableware and pastries, reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham, the contemporary artist behind the space. Arsham’s work, known for its exploration of time, erosion and imagined futures, has been integrated into the design of the café itself.The interiors merge sculptural forms and tactile materials to create a setting that feels more like a gallery or architectural installation than a conventional restaurant. This artistic philosophy extends to the menu, which features specialty coffee, pastries, cakes and light bites that have been developed and tested over months to match the same thoughtful, tactile ethos as the space’s design.Part of what makes Daniel’s Room stand out is its hybrid identity of being simultaneously a café, a cultural destination and an art installation. The space includes limited-edition books, collectible objects and custom-designed tableware created exclusively for the venue, not available in galleries or online elsewhere.Unlike typical retail in a shopping mall setting, these collectibles are integrated into the café experience rather than dominating it and encourage visitors to sit, explore the details and return for both the ambience and the edible offerings. Daniel’s Room has been described as a place to “live in, not just visit,” where patrons are encouraged to settle in, enjoy their coffee, peruse art books and absorb the carefully curated aesthetic.Located on Level 2 of Fashion Avenue in one of the world’s busiest retail destinations, Daniel’s Room benefits from high footfall while offering visitors a unique cultural and culinary break from mainstream dining spots in Dubai Mall. Dubai has long become a global hub for innovative culinary concepts and experiential dining, from themed fine-dining restaurants to cafés that elevate coffee culture to an art form and Daniel’s Room fits squarely into this trend, offering something that is both visually compelling and gastronomically satisfying.Daniel’s Room reflects a broader cultural shift where art, lifestyle and daily experiences converge. Rather than confining art to museums or galleries, this concept brings artistic ingenuity into everyday rituals like having a cup of coffee or enjoying a dessert. This approach is not entirely new as iconic creative figures like Gordon Matta-Clark and Damien Hirst have explored restaurant concepts tied to their artistic vision but Daniel’s Room positions this tradition within a contemporary, globally recognised retail and lifestyle context.By integrating sculptural design with carefully considered food and beverage offerings, the space becomes a destination for both locals and tourists seeking more than just a meal; they are seeking an experience that stimulates multiple senses. Daniel’s Room is more than a new café, it represents a blurring of boundaries between food, art and design.By transforming a routine coffee stop into an immersive cultural experience, Daniel Arsham’s latest venture contributes to Dubai’s reputation as a global city where creativity, luxury and everyday life intersect. Whether you are there for the specialty coffee, limited-edition collectibles or simply to soak in the art-infused space, Daniel’s Room offers a fresh way to experience Dubai Mall, not just as a retail hub but as a destination for cultural discovery.","Daniel’s Room is an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham.

In a stunning display that married adrenaline with architectural spectacle, five elite wingsuit athletes from XDubai recently executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina, which is now officially recognised as the world’s tallest hotel. The aerial stunt, part of the hotel’s grand opening celebrations, saw the team fly at speeds topping 200 km/h, including a jaw-dropping pass through a narrow architectural opening nicknamed the “eye of the needle.”This event did not just shatter expectations for extreme sports in the UAE, it spotlighted Dubai’s evolving strategy to fuse tourism, bold design and sky-high experiences into its global brand identity.At the heart of this spectacle is Ciel Dubai Marina, a landmark skyscraper rising to 377 metres, with 82 floors and 1,004 rooms and suites, now proudly holding the title of the world’s tallest hotel. The hotel’s dramatic architecture, complete with a glass-clad “Eye of the Needle” feature in its structure, served as the stage for the wingsuit team’s high-stakes flight.This distinctive design element, more typically admired from the ground, turned into a literal flight path for the athletes and a symbolic and literal integration of extreme sport with structural ingenuity.Ciel Dubai Marina’s opening and the choice of a wingsuit airshow reflects Dubai’s push to redefine mainstream hospitality by blending experience-driven tourism with record-breaking architecture.Wingsuit flying is one of the most technically demanding branches of sky sports, requiring intense control, aerodynamic precision and split-second decision-making. In this stunt, the lead flyer sliced through the tower’s narrow opening, an achievement that the team and onlookers dubbed the “eye of the needle” manoeuvre, at blistering speeds of over 200 km/h.The rest of the team maintained a tight formation around the hotel, their movements accentuated by coloured smoke trails that painted the sky above Dubai Marina. A custom FPV (first-person view) drone followed the team through their flight path, capturing cinematic footage from angles that no ground camera could match.Such stunts demand not only peak physical skill but also meticulous planning and coordination with team members rehearsing jumps and formations dozens of times to ensure safety and precision in execution.The wingsuit demonstration was more than a stunt; it acted as a global spectacle aligned with Dubai’s larger tourism ambitions. Dubai has consistently sought to intertwine extreme experiences with its luxurious hospitality offerings, from world-record attractions to architectural marvels. The combination of Ciel Dubai Marina’s grand opening and the wingsuit flight drew attention not just from local observers but from aviation, tourism and adventure enthusiasts worldwide.This aerial show also aligns with a rising trend of place-branding through experiential events, where cities leverage extraordinary activations (like skydives, wingsuit flights and other high-adrenaline displays) to signal innovation, modernity and fearless ambition to global audiences. Dubai’s use of extreme sports as part of its tourism and identity playbook is well-established. Organisations like XDubai have been behind several high-visibility events that combine thrill with destination marketing, including BASE jumps, wing suits and other aerial feats that often involve the city’s tallest structures or unique landscapes.The Ciel Dubai Marina flight expands this strategy into a new chapter, one where luxury hospitality openings are given experience-driven spectacles that both celebrate architectural achievement and propel media coverage worldwide. For the global tourism industry, such demonstrations serve a dual purpose: they position destinations as adventure-ready and forward-thinking and they create social media moments that amplify reach far beyond traditional travel marketing campaigns.The flight underscores several broader trends of blending extreme sports with destination launches, creating high-visibility spectacles rather than static ribbon-cuttings, architectural landmarks as arenas for experience-based storytelling where buildings become stages for memorable moments and Dubai’s strategic tourism diversification by combining luxury hospitality, adventure experiences and record-breaking design into its global brand.As cities around the world compete for attention in a crowded tourism landscape, activities like the XDubai wingsuit flight around Ciel Dubai Marina demonstrate how bold experiences can become powerful currency in the attention economy, attracting global eyes to local innovation. The recent wingsuit flight around and through Ciel Dubai Marina was more than a daring aerial stunt, it was a statement about Dubai’s evolving identity as a hub of experiential tourism and architectural excellence.By marrying extreme sports with the debut of the world’s tallest hotel, the event elevated a hospitality opening into a global conversation about taste, risk and spectacle. In doing so, it offered a compelling peek into how destinations of tomorrow might choose to tell their stories, not just with buildings but with bold, unforgettable moments in the sky.","Five elite XDubai wingsuit pros executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina.

Reduced surface traffic congestion

Enhanced commuter experience with climate-controlled stations and modern vehicles

Alternate ""Active"" loop

What’s next?





Dubai is officially taking its ""transport of tomorrow"" beneath the surface. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Elon Musk ’s The Boring Company, has identified the initial corridor for the revolutionary Dubai Loop.The first phase of this underground network will specifically target two of the most congested yet vital areas in the emirate. While the full 17km pilot phase will feature 11 stations, the ""anchor"" locations are set to connect Downtown Dubai and the Dubai Marina area.This strategic link aims to bridge the city's commercial core with its most popular residential and tourist seafront, effectively creating a ""wormhole"" that bypasses the daily gridlock of Sheikh Zayed Road.The Dubai Loop is an underground high-speed transport system developed in collaboration with The Boring Company, Elon Musk’s tunnel-building venture, and aims to dramatically cut travel times, ease congestion, and redefine urban mobility in Dubai. Officials say the system could evolve into a network capable of carrying 20,000 passengers per hour or more via high-speed electric vehicles moving through dedicated tunnels.Originally announced in 2025, the plan envisages an extensive network that spans several kilometres beneath the city’s busiest areas. The Loop will feature multiple underground stations integrated with existing transit systems, offering commuters fast, weather-protected travel while reducing traffic on surface roads.According to The Boring Company’s project overview, the initial network could eventually expand beyond its first phase to serve many more destinations, making it a cornerstone of Dubai’s long-term transportation transformation.RTA has indicated that construction will begin soon on the first phase, covering the section between Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Dubai Mall. These areas were chosen for early rollout because they are among Dubai’s most frequently travelled corridors, linking business districts with major retail, leisure and metro hubs.This section is expected to serve as a proof of concept for the larger network, allowing engineers and planners to refine operations, passenger handling and safety systems before extending the Loop to other high-traffic areas of the city.Once operational, the Loop is expected to offer:In parallel with the underground tunnels, a second ""Loop"" project led by Emirati firm URB is set to transform the city's surface. Known as THE LOOP, this is a 93km climate-controlled cycling and walking highway.This glass-enclosed structure will encircle the city, connecting over 3 million residents to key locations within a 20-minute walk or bike ride. Powered by kinetic flooring that generates electricity from your footsteps, this project aligns with the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan to make the city the most walkable and bike-friendly in the world.RTA officials, including Matar Al Tayer, have emphasised that the Dubai Loop’s first phase of work will begin imminently, though official operational dates are yet to be confirmed. Industry observers expect that initial segments could start test runs as early as 2026, with continued expansion in the years that follow.As the Loop takes shape, residents and commuters will get their first glimpse of how underground mass transit could complement Dubai’s world-class public transport system, from its iconic Metro to autonomous vehicles and high-speed rail.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has identified the initial corridor for the revolutionary Dubai Loop.

Ramadan 2026 countdown





Across the seven Emirates, the call to prayer provides a moment of reflection amidst the country's fast-paced lifestyle. For Tuesday, February 3, 2026, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (AWQAF) has released the official timings.In the capital, Abu Dhabi, the day began with the Fajr prayer at 5:41 AM, while in Dubai, the Adhan was called slightly earlier at 5:37 AM. As the sun reaches its peak, Dhuhr provides a mid-day pause for workers and residents alike. Following these precise timings ensures that the community remains connected through shared discipline and devotion.In the UAE, the moments following the prayer are cherished for ""Dhikr"" (remembrance). The IACAD (Islamic Affairs & Charitable Activities Department) encourages worshippers to utilize the quiet time after the final Tasleem for personal supplication.One of the most powerful practices involves reciting ""Ayat al-Kursi,"" which is believed to offer divine protection. Many residents also follow the Sunnah of reciting ""SubhanAllah"" (33 times), ""Alhamdulillah"" (33 times), and ""Allahu Akbar"" (33 times).These small acts of mindfulness help maintain spiritual clarity during a busy workday, acting as a mental and emotional reset.The UAE is already preparing for the most blessed month of the year. Based on astronomical data from the Emirates Astronomy Society, Ramadan 2026 is expected to begin on or around February 18, 2026. This year, Ramadan falls during the ""cool"" season, offering pleasant weather for those fasting. As the month progresses, the fasting hours will shift slightly.Authorities continue to advise worshippers to rely on official mosque announcements, Awqaf schedules, and trusted prayer calendars, as prayer times shift gradually each day due to seasonal changes.Mosques across the UAE broadcast the Azan in line with these approved timings, ensuring consistency for congregational prayers throughout the country.","For Tuesday, February 3, 2026, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (AWQAF) has released the official timings.

Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient but breaking the rules can cost commuters from Dh100 to a hefty Dh2,000. As the city’s public transport usage surges, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has reinforced a comprehensive list of penalties aimed at ensuring safety, cleanliness and smooth operations across stations and trains.From fare evasion and smoking to tampering with emergency equipment, the penalties cover everything from minor etiquette breaches to serious safety violations and they are strictly enforced.With millions of passengers using the Metro every day, Dubai’s transport authorities have increasingly focused on discipline, safety and passenger experience. Officials say the fines are designed not to punish but to encourage responsible commuting and protect public safety.According to RTA guidance, penalties range widely depending on severity, with behavioural infractions attracting smaller fines and safety-related violations attracting the maximum penalties.The most common fines come from everyday mistakes that many commuters may not realise are violations. Watch out as Dh100 fines include:These are considered etiquette or behavioural breaches but can still add up if repeated frequently.More serious violations relate to fare evasion, cleanliness and misuse of transport services. Watch out as Dh200 fines include:As for Dh500 fines, they include:These penalties aim to discourage fare fraud and maintain the Metro’s strict cleanliness standards.Sleeping in prohibited areas including shelters and restricted zones, carries a Dh300 fine, highlighting how even seemingly harmless actions can attract penalties.The highest fines are reserved for actions that could endanger passengers or disrupt operations. Watch out as Dh1,000 fines include:Meanwhile, Dh2,000 fines include:These violations are treated seriously due to the potential risk to lives and infrastructure.Metro users driving to stations also face penalties. Vehicles parked beyond permitted times at Metro car parks can attract Dh100 per day fines, capped at Dh1,000. Transport experts say strict penalties are part of Dubai’s strategy to maintain global-standard public transport systems.The city aims to keep its Metro safe, hygienic and efficient, especially as ridership grows due to tourism, population expansion and sustainability initiatives. RTA officials stress that compliance with signage and inspector instructions is crucial to preventing overcrowding, accidents and disruptions.Dubai’s Metro is central to the emirate’s smart mobility and sustainability goals, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Ensuring passengers follow rules helps keep the system reliable, a key factor as Dubai prepares for major expansions like new lines and rising commuter volumes.Commuter checklist:Dubai Metro fines range from Dh100 for minor etiquette breaches to Dh2,000 for serious safety violations, reflecting the city’s zero-tolerance approach to misconduct on public transport. With millions relying on the Metro daily, authorities say strict enforcement is essential to maintaining safety, efficiency and a world-class commuting experience.","Dubai’s ultra-modern Metro system is known for being fast, clean and efficient.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The ‘promotion’ that fractured OpenAI board



Read full email that Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott's sent to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders



[This document is from Musk v. Altman (2026).]

From: Kevin Scott

Sent: Sunday, November 19, 2023 7:31 AM

To: Frank X. Shaw, Satya Nadella, Brad Smith, Amy Hood, Caitlin McCabe

Frank,

I can help you with the timeline and with our best understanding of what was going on. I think the reality was that a member of the board, llya Sutskever, had been increasingly at odds with his boss, Sam, over a variety of issues.

One of those issues is that there is a perfectly natural tension inside of the company between Research and Applied over resource allocations. The success of Applied has meant that headcount and GPUs got allocated to things like the API and ChatGPT. Research, which is responsible for training new models, could always use more GPUs because what they're doing is literally insatiable, and it's easy for them to look at the success of Applied and believe that in a zero sum game they are responsible for them waiting for GPUs to become available to do their work. I could tell you stories like this from every place l've ever worked, and it boils down to, even if you have two important, super successful things you're trying to work on simultaneously, folks rarely think about the global optima. They believe that their thing is more important, and that to the extent that things are zero sum, that the other thing is a cause of their woes. It's why Sam has pushed us so hard on capacity: he's the one thing about the global optima and trying to make things non-zero sum. The researchers at OAl do not appreciate that they would not have anywhere remotely as many GPUs as they do have if there were no Applied at all, and that Applied has a momentum all its own that must be fed. So the only reasonable thing to do is what Sam has been doing: figure out how to get more compute.

The second of the issues, and one that's deeply personal to llya, is that Jakub moreso than Ilya has been making the research breakthroughs that are driving things forward, to the point that Sam promoted Jakub, and put him charge of the major model research directions. After he did that, Jakub's work accelerated, and he's made some truly stunning progress that has accelerated in the past few weeks. I think that Ilya has had a very, very hard time with this, with this person that used to work for him suddenly becoming the leader, and perhaps more importantly, for solving the problem that Ilya has been trying to solve the past few years with little or no progress. Sam made the right choice as CEO here by promoting Jakub.

Now, in a normal company, if you don't like these two things, you'd appeal to your boss, and if he/she tells you that they've made their decision and that it's final, your recourse is accept the decision or quit. Here, and this is the piece that everyone should have been thinking harder about, the employee was also a founder and board member, and the board constitution was such that they were highly susceptible to a pitch by Ilya that portrays the decisions that Sam was making as bad. I think the things that made them susceptible, is that two of the board members were effective altruism folks who all things equal would like to have an infinite bag of money to build AGI-like things, just to study and ponder, but not to do anything with. None of them were experienced enough with running things, or understood the dynamic at OAI well enough to understand that firing Sam not only would not solve any of the concerns they had, but would make them worse. And none of them had experience, and didn't seek experience out, in how to handle something like a CEO transition, certainly not for the hottest company in the world.

The actual timeline of events through Friday afternoon as I understand them:

Thursday late night, the board let's Mira know what they're going to do. By board, it's Ilya, Tash, Helen, and Adam.

Mira calls me and Satya about 10-15 minutes before the board talks to Sam. This is the first either of us had heard of any of this. Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me.

OAl Board notifies Sam at noon on Friday that he's out, and that Greg is off the board, and immediately does a blog post.

OAl all hands at 2P to rattled staff.

Greg resigns. He was blindsided and hadn't been in the board deliberations, and hadn't agreed to stay.

Jakub and a whole horde of researchers reach out to Sam and Greg trying to understand what happened, expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.

Friday night Jakub and a handful of others resign.

Microsoft chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, sent an email to CEO Satya Nadella and president Brad Smith, along with other C-suite executives, explaining the series of events that led to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November 2023. An email, dated November 19, 2023, suggests that the “shock” firing was not the result of a single ideological clash, but rather a mix of a variety of issues between llya Sutskever and Altman.The email, posted by X handle Internal Tech Emails, said that Sutskever “had been increasingly at odds with” Altman over two primary friction points. The first point of failure was an internal ‘battle’ over computing power. As ChatGPT’s popularity surged, the demand for GPUs became a zero-sum game within the company.According to Scott, Altman’s decision to prioritise GPU for the consumer products and API division infuriated the core research teams because they felt the fundamental work was being “starved” of the resources needed for the next generation of models.The second conflict was deeply personal to Sutskever, who – according to Scott’s email – had a hard time with the promotion of Jakub Pachocki, a researcher who had previously worked under Sutskever.After Pachocki spearheaded several major research breakthroughs, Altman promoted him to lead OpenAI’s core model development. While Scott characterised the move as “logical from a CEO perspective,” it alienated Sutskever.","Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent email to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders.

SpaceX, xAI merger and Musk’s $800 billion+ wealth

Soon after the historic merger of SpaceX and xAI, Elon Musk has announced a recruitment drive. The billionaire is calling for “elite” engineers to join SpaceX and Starlink as the company moves towards building AI-powered data centres in space. Musk amplified the posts shared by Michael Nicolls, Vice President of Starlink Engineering at SpaceX, confirming that the company is hiring across multiple critical disciplines to develop “AI satellites”.“We are hiring for many critical engineering roles to develop the technologies for AI satellites in space at our facilities in Austin and Seattle. Solar, process, automation, manufacturing, mechanical, electrical, optics, software... come build space data centers with great engineers at SpaceX and Starlink,” said Nicolls. Musk replied, “Help take humanity to the stars!”In the second post, Nicolls said, “We are also hiring elite engineers at our new 230 MeV cyclotron facility in Florida, where we are bringing single-event radiation testing in house to accelerate development across all SpaceX vehicles.”Musk replied, “Not many companies have cyclotrons!”. Cyclotron is a type of compact particle accelerator.The roles on offer include Antenna Engineer (Starlink), Antenna Engineer, Satellites (Starlink), Antenna Software Engineer, Satellites (Starlink) and more.The recruitment push follows Musk’s personal net worth crossing the $800 billion mark, and signals a move to integrate high-level AI capabilities directly into the Starlink satellite constellation. The expansion also marks a synergy between Musk’s recently merged entities. By combining xAI’s large-scale intelligence models with SpaceX’s orbital infrastructure, Musk is positioning Starlink to handle massive AI workloads that were previously restricted to terrestrial servers.Last month, Musk's AI-company xAI posted job openings to expand its team of AI talent. The company announced that it is looking to hire a “small, elite unit” of talent engineers who will function as a specialised force to hunt and hire the “absolute best people in the world.”According to a job listing on the xAI website, this new unit will report directly to Musk, who is looking for engineers who happen to be “people persons”, and successful applicants should have a history of building “cool products” that date back to their childhood.",Elon Musk is calling for “elite” engineers to join SpaceX and Starlink.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.
