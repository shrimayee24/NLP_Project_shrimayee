Google is bringing a new ‘Agent Mode’ to its Gemini app, CEO Sundar Pichai announced at the Google I/O 2025 event. Agent Mode in Gemini app is a new experiment coming soon to subscribers that lets one delegate complex planning and tasks to Gemini to get stuff done, the company said. During the I/O 2025 Keynote, Google announced the integration of agentic AI capabilities into Chrome, Search, and Gemini, enabling autonomous task handling like planning and scheduling, a shift from traditional AI's reactive nature.Agentic AI, as seen in the A2A protocol launched in April 2025, allows interoperability between AI agents, aiming to streamline complex user tasks across platforms, a response to growing demands for scalable multi-agent systems.With the new Agent Mode in the Gemini app, users can give the AI a task, and it will carry it out on its own. Detailing how the new mode will work, Google explained:“Say you’re looking for an apartment. Instead of you filtering through real-estate apps daily, Gemini can find listings that fit your criteria, schedule tours and add them to your calendar, and create side-by-side comparisons”.The tech giant is also improving its AI assistant tool, Project Mariner that helps users by searching the web and handling online tasks. The AI tool can now manage up to 10 tasks at the same time, Pichai said.He also introduced a new feature called “Teach and Repeat,” which allows users to show the AI how to do a task once, and it will remember how to do similar tasks in the future.Project Mariner will be rolled out to more users this summer.","Google is bringing a new ‘Agent Mode’ to its Gemini app, CEO Sundar Pichai announced at the Google I/O 2025 event.

Bryan Johnson drains all plasma from his body



Science behind plasma replacement



Bryan Johnson’s experiments spark mixed reactions online



Johnson’s experiments blend science with spectacle, causing debate



Also Read |

In the constantly changing universe of longevity science and biohacking, there are few figures who inspire as much fascination—and debate—as Bryan Johnson . The 46-year-old tech mogul, most famous for his multimillion-dollar crusade to reverse biological aging, has again caught public attention. This time, by having performed a procedure that sounds more like science fiction than science reality: a full-body plasma replacement .In a recent Instagram post, Johnson unveiled matter-of-factly, ""I drained all of the plasma from my body,"" saying his doctor described it as ""the cleanest she's ever seen."" To most, such an extreme procedure would be seen as outrageous, even perilous. For Johnson, though, it's merely another step on his individual mission to resist the aging process.This is not Johnson's initial plasma manipulation experiment. Previously, in a highly publicized attempt, he received plasma infusions from his adolescent son as part of what became referred to as the ""blood boy"" procedure under the theory that young blood could revitalize aged tissue—a theory based on disputed animal research.His most recent project, which he is now calling ""V2,"" is an even more extreme iteration of that idea. Rather than just being infused with donor plasma, Johnson had all his plasma taken out and replaced by albumin, the main protein in plasma that serves to control blood volume and transport vital substances throughout the body.As Johnson describes it, the objective of this process is a sort of biological do-over. He asserts that today's body is not able to efficiently get rid of waste and toxins because of lifestyle and environmental choices. By not keeping any of his plasma, he wants to wipe the biochemical clean slate and start over.Although Johnson's plasma replacement therapy is undoubtedly dramatic, its scientific merit is questionable. Transfusions of albumin are medically employed in hospitals to treat certain illnesses such as liver failure or shock, but complete plasma replacement in a healthy subject is very rare and unexplored territory.Johnson has said that his team is tracking a broad range of biomarkers both before and after the procedure to assess its possible impact on longevity, inflammation, and cellular health. Without peer-reviewed data or clinical trials, though, it's impossible to make firm conclusions.In spite of this, Johnson reports the experience as being dull. ""Nothing, really,"" he said he felt afterwards. ""I felt the same, went to bed, slept the same."" Whether this indicates that the treatment did not have any effect—or whether subtleties will manifest themselves in time—is still uncertain.As with most of Johnson's experiments, public reaction has varied from wonder to mockery. Social media users did not hesitate, with one commenting, ""Bro is giving so much free data and results,"" while another recognized, ""If people could keep from getting threatened by the harshness of his actions, they'd really see the potential for value his findings could have towards global longevity.""Others were more cynical, comparing his detailed biohacking regimens with less complicated, time-proven methods of aging. One reader posted a poignant remark, ""My grandmother lived to 100. She liked life, stayed active, and looked great—all without having her blood drained.""However, there is the feeling that—at least controversially—Johnson's work adds worthwhile data to the overall discussion of aging and longevity. His openness to testing himself provides insight into what the future of preventative medicine and personal optimization will be like.Bryan Johnson's experiments remain on the tightrope between medical progress and contemporary performance art. Critics point out that his techniques are expensive, out-of-reach, and maybe even irresponsible. Supporters reply that all science leaps start with experimentation that pushes the boundaries.What is clear is that Johnson's fundamental purpose speaks to a universal human aspiration: to prolong life, augment vitality, and put off the inexorable decay of age. His odyssey poses deeper questions regarding the morality of self-experimentation, the availability of anti-aging technology, and the thin dividing line between ingenuity and mania.",Tech mogul Bryan Johnson has performed a full-body plasma replacement.

Implications for users and content creators



Contest evaluation and future prospects



In the highly competitive landscape of instant messaging platforms, Telegram, a popular messaging app founded by Pavel Durov , has initiated a bold new contest aimed at content creators. The competition offers a prize pool of $50,000 for a viral video that underscores Telegram’s claim of being the original innovator in messaging technology — years ahead of its competitor WhatsApp, which Telegram labels a “cheap copycat.”This initiative marks Telegram’s first contest designed specifically for content creators, signaling the company’s increased focus on leveraging user-generated content to raise awareness about its platform’s unique features and capabilities. The contest was announced on May 19, 2025, by Pavel Durov himself, and aims to counteract alleged smear campaigns against Telegram by WhatsApp. With a submission deadline set for May 26, 2025, the campaign encourages participation from global audiences, aiming to clarify Telegram’s contributions to the messaging industry.Telegram and WhatsApp are two of the largest messaging platforms worldwide, both competing for dominance in the instant communication space. WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms Inc., boasts over two billion users globally, while Telegram, known for its focus on privacy and advanced features, has seen rapid growth, particularly in regions emphasizing secure messaging. The rivalry has intensified over the years, with Telegram frequently highlighting its pioneering features that WhatsApp later incorporated, and vice versa.Pavel Durov, Telegram’s CEO and founder, has publicly accused WhatsApp of conducting smear campaigns against Telegram, aiming to undermine its reputation. In response, Telegram’s new contest serves as a public relations strategy to emphasize Telegram’s innovative edge and solidify its position among messaging app users.The contest invites participants to create a viral video no longer than three minutes (180 seconds) that celebrates Telegram’s technological advancements and innovation history relative to WhatsApp. Key aspects of the contest include:Telegram provides participants with a curated list of 30 key features that the app introduced before WhatsApp adopted similar functionalities. However, Pavel Durov notes that the list is not exhaustive and that many. Telegram features still have no counterparts on WhatsApp.Telegram has long promoted its role as an innovator in the messaging app industry. The platform introduced a variety of features now commonplace in WhatsApp and other competitors, including:This innovation-driven branding underpins Telegram’s appeal to privacy-conscious users, tech enthusiasts, and developers worldwide.The contest arrives at a time when Telegram is increasingly positioning itself as a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream messaging apps. This strategy is part of a broader trend among users concerned about data privacy, censorship, and control over digital communication platforms.Simultaneously, Telegram’s open nature and support for bots and APIs have made it popular among developers and businesses seeking customizable communication tools. The contest, therefore, not only serves marketing objectives but also reinforces Telegram’s identity as a technology leader.In conjunction with the contest announcement, Pavel Durov addressed additional political pressures Telegram faces globally. On his Telegram channel, he claimed that a Western European government (implied to be France) had requested Telegram to silence conservative political voices in Romania ahead of the country’s presidential elections held on May 18, 2025. Durov stated that Telegram refused the request, emphasizing the platform’s commitment to protecting political freedom and user rights without blocking political channels.This statement underscores Telegram’s stance on political neutrality and freedom of expression, positioning the platform as resistant to government censorship demands.The contest opens opportunities for a wide range of content creators, including video producers, social media influencers, and digital marketers. By incentivizing creative promotion of Telegram’s features, the company aims to increase its user base and engagement on emerging social media platforms, where short-form videos dominate.Participants are encouraged to leverage contemporary digital marketing techniques, meme culture, and AI tools to maximize video reach and impact. The contest guidelines emphasize the importance of clear messaging, visual appeal, and potential for viral spread.The submitted videos will be reviewed and scored based on predefined metrics by Telegram’s evaluation panel, with winners announced in June 2025. This approach highlights Telegram’s commitment to community-driven content creation as part of its marketing and brand positioning strategy.If successful, the contest could set a precedent for future content initiatives designed to engage users creatively, leveraging social media trends to amplify Telegram’s messaging about innovation and privacy.",Telegram CEO Pavel Durov launches $50K viral video contest to expose WhatsApp’s ‘cheap copycat’ moves.

"Sorry Google and Elon Musk’s xAI, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella finds only China's DeepSeek's R1 as the first AI model close to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sorry-google-and-elon-musks-xai-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-finds-only-deepseeks-r1-as-the-first-ai-model-close-to-openais/articleshow/121216563.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google’s Sundar Pichai calls R1 ‘impressive’

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Satya Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” added Nadella.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call earlier this year.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, an AI advisor in the former US President Joe Biden administration, suggested that the hype may be exxagerated and overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says DeepSeek's R1 is the first large language model (LLM) that he's seen to rival OpenAI's performance.

But his lack of selfcontrol cost him his annual bonus/ NYT (Screengrab)





With a keen sense of smell and legs that seem too short for his body, Fu Zai has won a huge social media audience that has followed him doing official duties since he started as a sniffer dog last fall. He was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.A love of earning treats as rewards has earned Fu Zai strong performance reviews. But it’s also proved a challenge, as his trainer has found that keeping him in line is not easy.Fu Zai was caught on camera recently grabbing a bite of a sausage in a child’s hand during patrol. Officers have since tried to train him to better resist food, but many on social media offered support — and free sausages — for Fu Zai the next time he patrolled the streets. In another video, some of the corgi’s toys and snacks — part of a Lunar New Year “bonus”— were confiscated for sleeping on the job and using his bowl as a urinal. Experts said such behaviour is normal for corgis. “That’s why they’re challenging, too, because they get distracted pretty easily,” said Leonardo Palacio, owner of a training school in Connecticut.Fu Zai is an unusual choice for police work. Traditionally, corgis were bred to work on farms, herding cattle by biting their ankles.In recent times, they have become popular choices for pets, most famously associated with Queen Elizabeth II. But some have retained the propensity to nip. That trait might dissuade trainers when assessing the suitability of a dog for disciplined forces, said a trainer at Hong Kong Canine.Fu Zai’s trainer said he had initially ruled out a corgi as a police dog because of the breed’s reputation. Meeting Fu Zai changed his mind. He later invited Fu Zai to train at the police base. Over the next few months, the corgi excelled in detecting explosives. Moreover, he could fit under tight spaces some other dogs couldn’t reach.Fu Zai became a full-fledged member of Weifang police in Oct. He has since been beamed around the internet as a friendly face for the force, making frequent appearances on its official account on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok. A separate account, named “Fu Zai and his comrades,” has more than 400,000 followers. But the drive for food that helped him land the job also gotten him into some of his troubles. Whether as temptation he can’t resist or a treat used in training, there will probably be more sausage in Fu Zai’s future.","Fu Zai was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Google's annual developer conference, the I/O 2025 , arrived with its usual flurry of announcements, demos, and forward-looking promises. This year's I/O, held at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, continued the company's all-in approach on artificial intelligence with significant updates across its product lineup. From an eye-popping $250/month Ultra subscription to Search reimagined with AI, Google delivered a smorgasbord of announcements that ranged from genuinely impressive to slightly concerning for your wallet. Let's do a run down of everything that Google announced at the I/O 2025.Google's Gemini, the AI mode l powering many of the its services, received major upgrades across its lineup. The new Gemini 2.5 Pro now features an ""enhanced reasoning mode"" called Deep Think, which allows the model to consider multiple hypotheses before responding - particularly useful for complex math and coding problems. According to Google, this puts it at the top of the LMArena leaderboard in all categories, with Elo scores up more than 300 points since the first-generation Gemini Pro.Meanwhile, Gemini 2.5 Flash - the more efficient, cost-effective version - has been improved across reasoning, multimodality, code, and long context capabilities. Google claims it's now second only to 2.5 Pro on benchmark tests, while requiring 20-30% fewer tokens for responses. For developers looking for powerful, budget-friendly AI tools, this is the equivalent of getting premium performance at a mid-range price point.Remember Project Starline, Google's futuristic 3D video conferencing booth that promised to make it seem like your conversation partner was sitting right across from you? It's no longer just a research project - it's becoming a real product called Google Beam.The technology uses a six-camera array and AI to merge video streams into a realistic 3D experience viewed on a light field display. Google claims ""near perfect head tracking, down to the millimeter"" at 60 frames per second, all happening in real-time. HP will be the first to release Beam devices for enterprise customers later this year, with companies like Deloitte, Duolingo, and Salesforce already signed up.I'm not saying it's going to replace Zoom overnight, but it might actually make those endless virtual meetings slightly less soul-crushing.In the ""things nobody saw coming"" category, Google announced a new premium subscription tier called AI Ultra, priced at a jaw-dropping $250 per month. Yes, you read that correctly, two hundred and fifty dollars. Monthly.For this Netflix-annual-subscription-times-twenty price tag, subscribers get early access to Google's latest AI tools and unlimited use of features like Deep Research. The package includes 30TB of storage across Google Photos, Drive, and Gmail, plus YouTube Premium and access to experimental features like Project Mariner. New subscribers can get 50% off for the first three months, which still lands at $125 monthly.Google clearly believes some people are willing to pay premium prices for cutting-edge AI tools. The rest of us will just have to wait for these features to eventually trickle down to more affordable tiers.After what Google called ""one of the most successful launches in Search in the past decade"" with AI Overviews, the company is going all-in on transforming how we search the web with AI Mode. This separate tab in Google Search lets users ask longer, more complex questions and follow up with additional queries - essentially turning Google Search into a conversational AI experience.Early testers have been asking queries that are two to three times longer than traditional searches, suggesting users are already adapting to this new paradigm. AI Mode is rolling out to everyone in the US starting this week, powered by Gemini 2.5.Google is also adding features like Deep Search, which expands background queries from tens to hundreds to create comprehensive search responses, and an AI shopping experience that helps users find items and even virtually ""try on"" clothing by uploading a photo of themselves.Following last week's Android Show , where Google previewed some Android 16 features, I/O provided more details on Google's mixed reality plans. The company unveiled its Android XR platform for augmented, mixed, and virtual reality devices.The most interesting development is Project Aura, a prototype of Android XR-powered smart glasses developed with Xreal. These glasses will feature Gemini integration and a large field of view, along with built-in cameras and microphones. Google is also partnering with popular eyewear brands including Samsung, Gentle Monster, and Warby Parker to create more stylish options.Android XR will support features like live translation, directional navigation via a mini Google Maps display, and the ability to view immersive 360-degree videos. After Google Glass and previous AR attempts, this feels like the company's most serious push yet into wearable computing.Google's AI is coming for your inbox, but in a helpful way. Gmail will soon feature personalized smart replies that analyze your writing style and past emails to suggest responses that sound authentically like you. The system considers your typical greetings, tone, and even favorite word choices to generate more relevant replies.With your permission, Gemini can pull information from both your Gmail and Google Drive to craft these responses. For instance, if a friend emails asking about a road trip you've taken, Gemini could reference your past itineraries stored in Docs to suggest a detailed response.The feature will launch through Google Labs in July for English users on web, iOS, and Android platforms. It's either incredibly convenient or slightly unnerving, depending on how you feel about AI mimicking your writing style.Video calls with international colleagues or friends are about to get much easier. Google Meet is adding an AI-powered real-time translation feature that converts your speech into your conversation partner's preferred language nearly instantaneously. The system even attempts to match your tone and cadence while translating.The feature initially supports translation between English and Spanish, with more languages planned for the near future. It's rolling out in beta to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers first. This could be a game-changer for global businesses and multilingual families alike.Google's experimental AI agent, Project Mariner, received significant upgrades. The system can now handle up to 10 different tasks simultaneously, from booking flights to researching topics to comparing shopping options.The latest version also introduces a ""teach and repeat"" function, where you can demonstrate a task once, and it learns how to perform similar tasks in the future. Google is bringing Project Mariner's capabilities to developers via the Gemini API, with trusted testers like Automation Anywhere and UiPath already building with it.Remember when AI assistants were just glorified weather forecasters and timer-setters? Project Astra, Google's ambitious universal AI assistant prototype, is aiming to make those days feel like ancient history. At I/O 2025, Google showcased Astra's enhanced capabilities, demonstrating how it can now proactively use your phone's camera to ""see"" the world around you and take action without explicit commands.Google is positioning Astra as the culmination of its AI assistant work, capable of everything from diving into your emails to find bike specs to researching repair information and even calling local shops on your behalf. While some might feel queasy about giving an AI this much access to their digital lives, the productivity gains could be substantial, if you're comfortable with an AI assistant that might occasionally pipe up with unsolicited advice while you're trying to fix your bike chain in peace.The Astra features are already appearing in Gemini Live, which is now available to all Android users and rolling out to iOS starting today.If you thought artificially generated videos look comic, you should have watched Google’s keynote, as it’s new models were previewed. Veo 3, the latest version of Google's AI video generator, now supports audio generation - adding ambient sounds, music, and even dialogue to AI-generated videos. Previous versions could only create silent clips, which wasn't particularly useful in a world where TikTok and YouTube dominate.Imagen 4, Google's text-to-image model, has been improved to generate more photorealistic images with better handling of fine details like fabrics, water droplets, and animal fur. It can now export images in various formats and resolutions up to 2K.Google is also introducing Flow, an AI filmmaking app that builds on these technologies. Flow lets users create eight-second AI-generated video clips based on text prompts or images, with scene-builder tools to stitch clips together for longer videos. Think of it as having a mini film production studio in your pocket - albeit one that sometimes has bizarre interpretations of your creative vision.For developers and designers, Google unveiled Stitch, an AI-powered tool that generates user interfaces based on text descriptions. Users can provide wireframes, rough sketches, or screenshots of other designs to guide Stitch's output, making it easier to quickly prototype app and website designs.While it has more limited capabilities than some competing AI design tools, Stitch provides HTML and CSS markup for the designs it generates, helping bridge the gap between concept and implementation. The experiment is currently available through Google Labs.Google has announced a significant expansion of the app ecosystem for Android Auto, bringing highly anticipated features like video and browser applications, alongside a wider array of weather apps. Users can soon expect to see video and browser applications become available on Android Auto. Google has specified that video apps will require the connected phone to be running Android 16 and will only function on ""select compatible cars,"" and critically, only when the vehicle is parked.","Google's annual developer conference, the I/O 2025, arrived with its usual flurry of announcements, demos, and forward-looking promises.

From search to becoming an agent

AI has begun to replace the search as we know of it, as Google at the I/O announced the “AI Mode.” Available to all US users starting today, CEO Sundar Pichai calls the AI mode , a “total reimagining of search” that will transform’s Google’s headlining product from a link directory into an interactive AI assistant .""Search is bringing AI to more people than any other product in the world,"" Pichai said during the company's annual I/O developer conference, highlighting Google's 8.5 billion daily queries as a massive distribution advantage over competitors.AI Mode will provide users with a chatbot-style experience directly within Google Search, allowing them to ask follow-up questions and receive AI-generated responses rather than just links to websites. The feature was previously available only to limited test users through Google's Labs program.""We launched AI Overviews last year at I/O, and since then there's been a profound shift in how people are using Google Search,"" said Liz Reid, VP and Head of Search at Google. ""People are coming to Google to ask more of their questions, including more complex, longer and multimodal questions.""The new AI Mode is a fundamental shift from Google's traditional approach of displaying webpages in response to queries. Instead, users can have conversational interactions similar to ChatGPT or even Perplexity, with the system providing synthesized answers and allowing follow-up questions.""The search results page was a construct,"" explained Liz Reid, who leads Google's search team, suggesting that the way people have used Google for two decades was largely a response to the web's structure.AI Overviews was beginning of this end, and the AI Mode is coming as users are engaging with artificially generated overviews more than blue links. ""In our biggest markets like the U.S. and India, AI Overviews is driving over 10% increase in usage of Google for the types of queries that show AI Overviews,"" Reid stated.Nick Fox, who runs Google's knowledge and information products, views this shift as natural evolution: ""In the past, search would have been limited to, 'if there's a piece of information out there, I can deliver it back to someone.'"" He emphasized that Google's AI models now ""have the ability to reason, to transform, to connect dots across, to synthesize, to do all these other things that go beyond information retrieval to this notion of intelligence.""Beyond AI Mode, Google also showed off its "" Project Mariner ,"" which can autonomously perform tasks like booking travel or researching topics. The company also announced "" Deep Search "" for comprehensive research and ""Search Live"" for real-time visual assistance.However, there’s still sometime before the blue links disappear altogether. Fox notes that the Google Search still remains the “best experience” for most users, and at least for now, the AI mode will live in a separate tab, and users could use as they like. Although, the features sooner or later will gradually migrate to the traditional search experience.""In three years,"" Fox predicted, ""we will all think about and use Search in a way completely unrecognizable to today's product.""Google plans to first introduce these advanced capabilities in Labs for power users before gradually integrating successful features into the core Search experience.","AI Mode will provide users with a chatbot-style experience directly within Google Search.

Gmail’s smart replies are getting ‘smarter’; here’s how the improved AI feature will work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gmails-smart-replies-are-getting-smarter-heres-how-the-improved-ai-feature-will-work/articleshow/121299882.cms,"Gmail personalised smart replies: How it will work



“Replying to email often means referencing details buried in other files, or re-reading long threads just to gather context. And it takes time to write in the way you want. Personalised smart replies in Gmail will help you draft emails that match your specific context and your tone. By pulling from your past emails and Google Drive, Gemini provides response suggestions with specific details that are more relevant and on point, eliminating the need to dig through your inbox and files yourself. Crucially, it also adapts to your typical tone — whether crisp and formal or warm and conversational — so your replies sound authentically like you.”

Gmail's smart replies will now be more personalised. At its latest annual developer conference, Google I/O 2025 , the company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai , announced that the feature will now be able to pull information from the user’s inbox and Google Drive with the help of Gemini AI. During the event, Pichai showed a demo of him replying to a co-worker’s email about a holiday to show how Gmail will personalise replies based on the user. These enhancements build on Google’s ""contextual"" upgrade to smart replies introduced last year. With these new changes, smart replies are expected to be able to incorporate a broader range of context than before. With this update, Google aims to make Gemini better match the user’s tone and style, making suggested replies more relevant and tailored to individual user communication patterns.This update will allow for longer responses, moving beyond short phrases. Earlier, smart replies could only draw information from the current Gmail thread.In a blog post, Google writes:The company also noted that the feature will be available generally later this year.Apart from this, Gmail is getting more AI‑based features, which include an inbox cleanup tool and faster appointment scheduling. The inbox cleanup feature lets users command Gemini to delete or archive unwanted emails, such as “Delete all my unread emails from The Groomed Paw from last year”—and declutter their inbox with a single click.Faster appointment scheduling detects when a user is arranging a meeting and prompts them to share available time slots directly within Gmail, allowing external clients or contacts to book without leaving the inbox. The company noted that both features will be generally available next quarter.","Gmail's smart replies will now be more personalised.

It also features a 1 million-token context window, which allows it to handle longer inputs and video understanding tasks.Google said that thanks to LearnLM — a version of Gemini developed with educational experts — the model now leads in learning-related tasks as well.“Educators and experts preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro over other models across a diverse range of scenarios,” the company said.Google also introduced native audio output for a more natural AI experience. Gemini can now speak with different tones, accents, and styles — such as a dramatic voice when telling a story. It can also:The text-to-speech tool now supports multiple speakers and over 24 languages, and it can switch between languages mid-conversation. These features will be available later today through the Gemini API.Google said that it is testing an enhanced reasoning mode called Deep Think, which helps Gemini consider multiple answers before responding. It's aimed at tough challenges like advanced math and programming.“We’re starting to test an enhanced reasoning mode called Deep Think,” the company said.“We’re taking extra time to conduct more frontier safety evaluations and get further input from safety experts.”Deep Think is already leading benchmarks like the 2025 USAMO (math), LiveCodeBench (coding), and MMMU (multimodal reasoning).Gemini 2.5 Flash, the lightweight version of the model, now uses 20–30% fewer tokens while improving performance across reasoning, code, and multimodal tasks, the company announced. It is now available in the Gemini app, Google AI Studio , and Vertex AI.A general release of the updated model is expected in early June, with 2.5 Pro following soon after.","Gemini 2.5 Pro model now tops performance charts, including WebDev Arena for coding and LMArena for human preference testing.

Google Meet real-time live translation: Here’s how it will work



“You can see how well it matches the speaker’s tone and expressions,”

Google Meet is getting new live speech translation capabilities, which will be powered by Gemini AI . The company announced these new capabilities during the keynote speech at its annual developer conference, Google I/O 2025 . This feature will translate spoken words into a conversation partner's preferred language in real-time. Google claims that the AI-generated translation will preserve the original speaker's voice, tone, and expression. During the event, the company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai , showed a demonstration where an English speaker can be seen communicating with a Spanish speaker, with Meet providing AI-generated English translations that maintained vocal inflexions, and vice versa. To compare, Microsoft Teams introduced a similar AI translation feature in a preview earlier this year.In a vlog post, the company writes:As per the video demo, rather than just displaying translated captions, Google Meet’s new real‑time translation will capture a speaker’s voice and convert it into another language, while retaining their unique tone, inflexion, and speaking style.Pichai said at the end of the demonstration.Powered by Gemini AI, the feature delivers low‑latency processing and natural voice synthesis so the translated output sounds like the original speaker instead of a generic text‑to‑speech voice.In the demo, an English speaker and a Spanish speaker held a fluent conversation as each person’s voice was translated live, creating a seamless, personalised interaction.","Google Meet is getting new live speech translation capabilities, which will be powered by Gemini AI.
