Could the NFL Introduce a New Playoff Format Starting in 2025? What Does It Mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-the-nfl-introduce-a-new-playoff-format-starting-in-2025-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/117163691.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

What Changes Could the NFL Make to the Playoff Format for the 2025 Season?



Los Angeles Chargers (11-6, No. 5 seed) at Houston Texans (10-7, No. 4 seed)

Minnesota Vikings (14-3, No. 5 seed) at Los Angeles Rams (10-7, No. 4 seed)

Washington Commanders (12-5, No. 6 seed) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-7, No. 3 seed)

The Debate Over Seeding Changes



The NFL is reportedly exploring potential modifications to its playoff format, a move that could significantly impact the postseason landscape. According to Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports, the league is considering revising how playoff seeding is determined, with a focus on prioritizing teams with higher winning percentages over division winners when assigning home-field advantage during the Wild Card Round. This potential shift comes in response to scenarios where teams with superior records are forced to play on the road against division winners with lower records.Since the NFL expanded its playoff field in 2020 by adding two more teams, the basic structure of the postseason has remained largely unchanged. Under the current system, the team with the best record in each conference earns a coveted first-round bye, while the three other division winners secure home games in the Wild Card Round. This setup ensures that division champions are rewarded with higher seeding, even if their overall record trails behind wild-card teams.However, as the 2024-25 playoffs approach, this model has raised questions about fairness. Three matchups this postseason feature teams with better records playing on the road against division winners, a phenomenon that has reignited discussions about the need for reform. Jonathan Jones pointed out the disparity, stating, ""JB, there are three games this week featuring teams with better records than their opponents but playing on the road.""These matchups include:The proposed change would introduce a new dynamic to playoff seeding. Under this concept, home games in the Wild Card Round would go to the top four teams by win percentage, rather than simply awarding them to division winners. Such a system aims to reward consistent performance throughout the season rather than relying solely on divisional supremacy. However, as Jones noted, ""Team owners haven't shown an appetite for changing, though.""Critics argue that altering the seeding criteria could diminish the value of winning a division. Division titles represent a key benchmark of success within the current format, and any change might shift the focus toward overall record comparisons. While proponents believe this would promote competitive fairness, detractors point out the inherent scheduling disparities across teams, which could complicate such comparisons.Although these discussions have gained momentum, there is no certainty that a format change will occur. Historically, league owners have resisted altering the playoff structure, preferring to maintain the balance between rewarding division winners and accommodating competitive fairness.Also Read: Who Will Be Houston Texans’ Challenger in the Divisional Round After Their Defensive Masterclass Against the Chargers? If implemented, the proposed changes could reshape the postseason experience for teams and fans alike. However, for now, the traditional format remains intact, with further deliberations expected in the offseason.","The NFL is reportedly exploring potential modifications to its playoff format.

Did Taylor Swift stalk her ex-boyfriend amid romance with Travis Kelce?

Taylor Swift has been at the center of controversy after allegedly seeing the Instagram stories of a fan page of her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, whom she had a six-year relationship with before breaking up in April 2023. The news opened up discussions on Swift's reasons and her past relationship with Alwyn. The drama escalated when the fan account was accused of creating a fake account to stage the incident.A fan page of Joe Alwyn revealed that Taylor Swift was checking their Instagram stories, which gave rise to the conspiracy theory. In return, @a.girl.named.aurora published a screen recording where the administrator scrolled through a story and ended up revealing Swift's account.Addressing the backlash, the fan account denied any deceit, stating, “I had no interest in sharing the screen record and bringing this up again. It was just interesting and funny to me, and I had no other intention.” The user explained that the screen recording was made after the story had expired, causing the absence of usernames and insights.Fans remain divided over the incident. Some believed that Taylor Swift’s alleged activity was deliberate, with one commenter suggesting, “She WANTED Joe to see that and feel some type of way.” Others speculated that the viewing might have been accidental or handled by Swift’s PR team. “More than likely a PR person did it by mistake, not actually Taylor,” one fan theorized.Critics argue that Swift's publicized behavior following her breakup with Alwyn, including her appearances at Travis Kelce's games, may indicate potential communication towards her ex. “It screamed of when someone posts selfies to prove they’re fine to their ex, but on a global scale,” remarked one user.Concerns have arisen for Joe Alwyn, with some noticing the hate directed towards him by Swift's extreme followers despite the clarification. “Given the amount of hate her unhinged fans have sent his way, it seems very unlikely he’d want to get back with her,” commented another user.Also Read: “Dumb frat boy”: Fans trash Travis Kelce claiming he is out of his league to marry superstar Taylor Swift Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce first sparked dating rumors in September 2023 after Swift attended a handful of Kelce's games.

"Paris, we are coming today: Twitter erupts over post by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-airlines-twitter-pia-paris-9-11/articleshow/117118737.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines' Greatest Hits



Standing Passenger Incident: Allegedly allowing an overbooked passenger to fly standing in the aisle because no seats were available. The Goat Sacrifice: A ground crew sacrificed a black goat at Islamabad Airport for good luck, sparking global ridicule. The Forgotten Passenger: Leaving a passenger stranded at a layover airport while the flight took off without them. Paris, We’re Coming: The now-infamous image of a plane seemingly diving into the Eiffel Tower, proving that PIA’s marketing gaffes remain undefeated.

There are airlines that symbolize innovation, and then there’s Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)—an entity so hilariously unpredictable that it’s essentially become the aviation world’s sitcom. From passengers reportedly standing in the aisles on overbooked flights to sacrificing goats for “divine intervention,” PIA has firmly cemented its status as the king of chaotic headlines.This time, PIA has outdone itself. An ostensibly official post from the airline’s X handle (formerly Twitter) sent shockwaves through the internet, especially curious since X has been largely restricted in Pakistan. The tweet featured an image of a PIA aircraft seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower, accompanied by the caption: “Paris, we are coming today.” The unfortunate imagery immediately drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed the shadow of a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.The internet, as expected, went into overdrive. User @zain175 sarcastically remarked, “First, they wanted to shadow skyscrapers, now they’re going straight for landmarks. Bold marketing strategy!” Meanwhile, @dexter7695 shared the image with the caption, “PIA: where every flight feels like an episode of ‘Final Destination.’” Another user, @sanjeevsanyal, joked, “This marketing strategy is so bad, it might actually be genius.”The tweet also reignited memories of PIA’s greatest hits. @muzairb quipped, “First it was goats, now it’s global landmarks. PIA never disappoints.” @cruindggn added, “At this point, PIA should just rename their airline to ‘Oops Air’ and own it.” User @saikirankannan chimed in with, “Next stop: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ‘We’re just helping it lean a little more.’”Others couldn’t help but connect the mishap to Pakistan’s controversial ties to 9/11 and Al-Qaeda. While none of the 9/11 hijackers were Pakistani, the eventual discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad cast a shadow over the country’s global reputation. In fact, there's a long-standing joke where former Pak premier Pervez Musharraf calls up George W Bush to offer his condolences but ends up accidentally calling before the incident.The tweet unwittingly touched a nerve, blending dark humor with unfortunate timing, leading many to wonder who approved such an image for a public-facing platform.PIA’s PR misstep is just another in a long line of its infamous blunders, but it has, once again, captured the internet’s imagination for all the wrong reasons.Love it or hate it, PIA always keeps us entertained—whether it’s on the tarmac, in the skies, or on social media.","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted an image of a plane seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower with the caption: ""Paris, we are coming today"" The image drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.

The Duchess of Sussex , Meghan Markle has announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute, in a post on Tuesday. She shared a touching video montage of her 'sweet' companion, who was scheduled to appear in her upcoming Netflix programme.The Duchess expressed her profound grief, acknowledging countless tears shed whilst thanking her faithful pet for years of unwavering devotion. She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up….and fell in love. They referred to him as ‘the little guy’ because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‘Guy’. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom….he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you’ll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they’re not there. But they are. And that’s okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy. You filled my life in ways you’ll never know,"" the Suits star added., the anticipated programme, launching on January 15, will showcase the Duchess sharing her expertise in cooking and gardening, the Daily Mail reported.Additionally, viewers might also have noticed a black Labrador in the brief promotional footage for Meghan's Netflix programme - Pula, who joined the family before Archie's arrival in 2019.","The Duchess of Sussex announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute.

What is the THAAD System?

Key features of THAAD include:

Range and coverage: Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems.

Capable of engaging targets up to 200 kilometres away, THAAD covers a larger area than the Patriot missile system and complements other defence platforms like the Aegis and Ground-based Midcourse systems. Components: A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit.

A THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, an advanced AN/TPY-2 radar system, and a fire control unit. Deployment: Operated by a crew of 95 soldiers, the system is rapidly deployable and designed to protect against evolving missile threats both within and outside the atmosphere.

The United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was deployed in Israel to intercept a Houthi ballistic missile launched from Yemen, Times of Israel reported. This marks the first operational use of the advanced missile defence system since its deployment to Israel in October. Footage shared on social media captured the dramatic launch of a THAAD interceptor, with an American soldier exclaiming, ""Eighteen years I’ve been waiting for this.""The missile, reportedly targeting Israel, was neutralised by air defence systems. However, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have not specified whether the interception was achieved by the American THAAD or an Israeli system. According to sources cited by Reuters, an analysis is underway to determine the success of the THAAD system.The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network. Designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, THAAD employs “hit-to-kill” technology, where interceptors physically collide with incoming missiles to destroy them. This approach minimises collateral damage and maximises precision.Originally developed by Lockheed Martin in the 1990s, THAAD has undergone significant testing and enhancements. The US Army currently operates seven THAAD batteries, with deployments in strategic locations such as Guam and South Korea, and most recently, Israel.","The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is a cornerstone of the US ballistic missile defence network.

Sandringham's history and royal tensions

Happier times at Sandringham

The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas, continuing a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. The 20,000-acre estate, purchased in 1862, holds significant historical value for the family. George V, former king of the UK, famously cherished Sandringham, saying, ""Dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world."" More than 160 years after it was first acquired by the royal family, the estate remains a cherished setting for the royal Christmas celebrations.The preparations for the holiday include selecting a large Christmas tree from the estate grounds, a tradition started by King Charles' great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert. King Charles selects a 20-foot Norfolk spruce tree from the grounds each year. The tree is typically decorated with red, gold, and purple ornaments, along with twinkling Christmas lights. The Grand Staircase is often adorned with festive decorations, and the Waterloo Chamber is transformed into a winter wonderland.The King also approves menus for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. The chef traditionally carves the turkey in front of the guests. However, one change King Charles may make concerns the temperature in the home. Prince Harry previously described Sandringham’s temperature as “balmy,” saying, “The corgis always betrayed us. The cool air would make them whimper, and Granny would say: 'Is there a draft?' And then a footman would promptly shut the window.”Guests arrive on Christmas eve based on seniority. As Sandringham is the smallest of the royal residences, some guests may have to sleep in rooms typically reserved for staff. One quirky tradition involves guests weighing themselves upon arrival. A tradition from Edward VII involved weighing guests upon arrival and departure to ensure they were well-fed.The family enjoys afternoon tea at 4 pm, with favorites such as square sandwiches, ham and English mustard, Sage Derby cheese, and Coronation Chicken. Desserts include ginger cake, honey and cream sponge, scones, and a pot of Earl Grey tea.At 6 pm, the family exchanges small, humorous gifts, a nod to the German tradition of ""Heiligabend Bescherung,"" introduced by Prince Albert. Princess Diana once gave Sarah Ferguson a leopard print bath mat, while Kate, Princess of Wales, gifted a ""grow your own girlfriend"" kit to a bachelor Prince Harry.Later in the evening, after the children go to bed, a formal dinner is served for the adults, with men in black tie and women in ballgowns and jewels. The meal is followed by martinis and a lavish four-course feast.Christmas day starts with breakfast and an 11 am church service at St Mary Magdalene Church. The royals greet the crowds as they leave the church. The family returns to Sandringham for pre-lunch drinks, including Veuve Clicquot champagne, and a traditional Christmas dinner at 1 pm. The meal includes turkey, potatoes, vegetables, sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, with Christmas pudding served with brandy butter and brandy sauce, followed by a cheese course with port. The table is decorated with white linen, candelabras, and a sprig of the Holy Thorn, a tradition that dates back before the Reformation.The King's speech is watched on television afterward. The family spends the rest of the afternoon at leisure.In the evening, guests enjoy a buffet of traditional English cuisine, including boar's head, ox tongue, and seafood, along with a table of chocolates and mints.Boxing Day features a hunt for the men, followed by lunch and dinner with traditional dishes. The meal typically consists of hearty fare, such as beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. For dessert, there is apple pie and Christmas pudding slices fried in unsalted butter. Dinner that evening might feature venison with dauphinoise potatoes and carrots, followed by a chocolate pie made of cream, meringue, and cinnamon.Sandringham has witnessed its share of controversy over the years. Princess Diana, who was often unhappy spending Christmas at the estate, would frequently chat with the staff to avoid family members. Royal chef Darren McGrady recalled how Diana would walk around the kitchen after dinner, seeking refuge from the tight quarters of the estate, which he described as “so compact.”In Andrew Morton's biography, Diana was quoted describing a dramatic row with Prince Charles in 1982 when she was pregnant with Prince William. ""I threw myself down the stairs,"" she reportedly said. ""Charles said I was crying wolf, and I said I felt so desperate, and I was crying my eyes out, and he said: 'I'm not going to listen. You're always doing this to me. I'm going riding now.'""Sandringham also hosted a tense summit in January 2020 between King Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, after Harry announced he would step back from royal duties. The meeting led to a public statement from the Queen, wishing Harry and Meghan a “peaceful and happy new life.” Meghan Markle , who enjoyed her first Christmas at Sandringham in 2017, shared a fond memory with her mother. “It’s just like a big family like I always wanted,” she said during a phone call. ""There was just this constant movement and energy and fun."" Prince Harry also spoke of happier times, saying, ""Christmas was fantastic.""","The Royal Family gathers at King Charles' Sandringham estate in Norfolk each Christmas.

'Diana hated Sandringham'

‘No boisterous behavior’

Disappointment over gag gifts

Familiar yet unwelcome traditions

Royal experts weigh in

Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, revealed that Diana found the royal holiday traditions “claustrophobic.”Speaking to Fox News Digital, Seward explained that Diana felt constrained by the royal customs, saying she did not want to follow so many rules to enjoy herself. “Diana hated Sandringham,” Seward said. “Even when her romance with Charles was going well, she still didn’t like it… I think she found it claustrophobic because Diana was such a free spirit. She didn’t want to have to enjoy herself with so many rules. [But] they’re not rules. They’re just traditions of royalty.” Seward noted that the order of precedence and other royal traditions made Diana uncomfortable.In his 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton recounted Diana’s experience during her first Christmas at Sandringham in 1981. She had given expensive gifts, while the royal family exchanged gag gifts.“It was highly fraught,” Diana told Morton. “I know I gave, but I can’t remember being a receiver. Isn’t that awful? I do all the presents, and Charles signs the cards. [It was] terrifying and so disappointing. No boisterous behavior, lots of tension, silly behavior, silly jokes that outsiders would find odd, but insiders understood.” Diana added, “I sure was [an outsider].”Seward corroborated this story, sharing that a friend who worked at Sandringham witnessed Diana’s disappointment. Diana reportedly gave cashmere sweaters and other expensive items but received a simple, less thoughtful gift in return. “She just couldn’t understand [it],” Seward said. “To her, Christmas was all about spending a bit more than you could probably afford and getting really nice presents.”Despite her dislike for the traditions, Diana was familiar with Sandringham as her father had a house on the estate. However, her hairdresser, Richard Dalton, told author Kitty Kelley that Diana “hated going to Sandringham for Christmas,” mentioning the cold and the requirement to watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television. Dalton referred to it as a “command performance.” An unnamed friend also told author Tina Brown that Diana dreaded going to Sandringham.Royal experts shared their views on Diana’s experience at Sandringham. Hilary Fordwich explained that Diana’s gift-giving experience was “embarrassing and painful,” as she wasn’t aware of the family’s gag gift tradition. Nick Bullen, co-founder of True Royalty TV, commented that the royals exchange “silly joke presents,” with author Christopher Andersen noting that Queen Elizabeth II preferred gag gifts. Andersen also claimed that Prince Charles’ favorite gift was a toilet seat from Princess Anne.King Charles and Diana had separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.","Princess Diana reportedly 'hated' spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham Estate in UK.

These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Jaime Taylor: More Than Just Lamar's Girlfriend



Lamar Jackson can wow everyone with jaw-dropping athleticism on the NFL field, but behind all the MVP trophies and highlight reels is an even quieter, equally inspiring story: his relationship with Jaime Taylor . From hallways of high school to the fields of the NFL, this journey is riddled with heart, hustle, and a whole lot of love.Their love story? It's the kind of wholesome, heartwarming tale that makes you believe in ""ride or die.""The romance between Jackson and Taylor started in the corridors of Boynton Beach Community High School, Florida. Imagine this: Lamar-the high school hotshot-and Jaime-three grades behind-which formed a bond that later on would become something special and way much more special than that. They never formally started dating until much later, but the ground work was already laid and it carried them through their college days at the University of Louisville.During Lamar's final year in college football in 2017, they started officially dating. How does someone fall in love with a Heisman winner who simply rolls around on the field without batting an eye? And though Lamar stole the headlines, Jaime, on the other hand, wasn't one who was sitting in the bleachers, watching all that go on. She stayed by Lamar's side while he ascended into greatness and kept going with her life.Let's be realistic, shall we? Dating an NFL quarterback isn't all touchdown dances and game-day hype, it’s sharing the spotlight—and the scrutiny. As Lamar became the league's youngest MVP in 2019, Jaime faced her own challenges and controversies in the public eye..In a 2019 interview as published by the Ravens , Taylor spoke about how Lamar taught her to face criticism“He's taught me how to handle criticism. I mean, I used to get mad when I'd read stuff. Then I'd look at him, and he's just fine. He says, ‘Let them do the talking. You don't have to say anything. Just show them.” Classic Lamar—quietly proving doubters wrong on the field while teaching Jaime to handle the noise with grace.Things got real when Lamar was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in 2018. With Taylor still in Louisville finishing her studies, the couple faced the dreaded long-distance challenge—609 miles, to be exact. But instead of letting the distance fumble their relationship, they doubled down. Jaime made every effort to attend Lamar's games, proving that love, much like football, is all about showing up, even if it takes nine hours to get there.In January 2021, Lamar and Jaime leveled up in their relationship game with the arrival of their daughter, Milan, affectionately called Lani. Becoming parents was a game-changer for the duo, deepening their bond and giving fans a rare glimpse into their personal lives.Although they're very private, Lamar often gives his fans glimpses into adorable dad moments on social media. Birthday celebrations to family outings reveal Lani is now at the center of their universe-and honestly, how couldn't she be?While Lamar will be all over the media for his record-breaking sprint, Jaime is not sitting on the sidelines. For one, she is a Los Angeles-based entrepreneur; she has made a wonderful career for herself working directly with the world's major brands and photographers. Be it her own version of Lamar Jackson, breaking barriers - and in style.If Jaime is able to keep her personal career flourishing while supporting Lamar's high-octane career as well, that speaks greatly about their relationship.Now this is the point where fans are starting to ask, ""When's the wedding?"" However, Lamar and Jaime appear to be doing just fine juggling work and family life. Jaime is, in her own right, an entrepreneur not standing in Lamar's shadow but rather shining brightly in her own lane.Their relationship is built on an open line of communication and mutual respect, qualities that have only helped them navigate the challenges of fame and parenting. Whether or not there's a ring in their immediate future, one thing's for sure: these two are in it for the long haul.Lamar Jackson and Jaime Taylor's relationship is that kind of story that just makes you root for love. From high school sweethearts to co-parents and partners navigating fame, their journey is a masterclass in resilience and devotion. Of course, Lamar may rule the football field, but Jaime's quiet strength behind the scenes is the real MVP energy we love to see.Also read - Did Breaking Up with Travis Kelce Set Kayla Nicole’s Career to New Heights?

"TikTok warns US Supreme Court on ban: If Congress could do this to TikTok, it could ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-warns-us-supreme-court-on-ban-if-congress-could-do-this-to-tiktok-it-could-/articleshow/117153463.cms,"During Supreme Court arguments, TikTok warned that a law forcing its sale or ban in the U.S. could set a precedent impacting other companies. Represented by Noel Francisco, TikTok argued the law violates First Amendment free speech. Defending the law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar emphasized the urgency of national security concerns with a January 19 deadline.

Upset Tiktok content creators

TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance reportedly offered a warning during Supreme Court arguments over a law that would compel the sale of the short-video app or ban it in the United States. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the lawyer representing TikTok warned of broader implications for other companies. Noel Francisco, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that: ""If Congress could do this to TikTok, it could come after other companies, too.""The law, debated by the justices, sets a January 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell the platform or face a ban due to national security concerns. The companies argue that the law violates First Amendment free speech protections and seek at least a delay. Francisco argued that upholding this law could justify similar actions against other companies. He cited the example of AMC theaters, previously Chinese-owned, suggesting Congress could use this precedent to censor or promote specific films.While some justices expressed First Amendment concerns, their questions suggested an inclination to uphold the law. TikTok boasts roughly 170 million U.S. users. Congress passed the measure with bipartisan support in 2024, citing fears of Chinese government espionage and influence operations.Jeffrey Fisher, representing TikTok content creators, reportedly questioned why the law targeted only TikTok and not other Chinese online retailers like Temu, which has 70 million U.S. users. He questioned the logic of singling out TikTok while ignoring other platforms potentially subject to Chinese control.As per the Reuters report, solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the law for the Biden administration, emphasized the urgency of the January 19 deadline to force ByteDance's action. She argued that ""foreign adversaries"" wouldn't willingly relinquish control over a major U.S. communication channel and that the deadline might be the necessary ""jolt"" for divestiture.A January 19 ban would prevent new TikTok downloads on Apple and Google platforms, though existing users could initially still access the app. However, the app's functionality would degrade over time without ongoing support.The Court also debated whether potential Chinese propaganda or influence campaigns justified the ban. Francisco countered that content manipulation is widespread, citing various U.S. news outlets.There was mention of the possibility of a change in administration affecting the law's enforcement, with the suggestion that a new administration might pursue a different approach. A justice questioned whether the president could simply choose not to enforce the law, to which the Solicitor General acknowledged presidential enforcement discretion. The argument was made that a preliminary injunction could provide ""breathing space.""","TikTok warned that a law forcing its sale or ban in the U.S. could set a precedent impacting other companies.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
