What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar Vembu said Sarvam AI's work shows that ‘world-class AI’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Colourful like the iMac



Apple’s most affordable MacBook in years could be just weeks away. The company is finalising a budget laptop that ditches the M-series chip for an iPhone-class processor, comes dressed in fun new colours, and is expected to retail well under $1,000, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in his latest Power On newsletter.Code-named J700, the MacBook will run on an A-series chip similar to those found in iPhones—a first for any modern Mac notebook. The display is expected to measure slightly under 13 inches, slotting it below the MacBook Air in both size and spec. Apple is targeting students and enterprise users with this one, taking direct aim at Chromebooks and budget Windows laptops that have had the affordable end of the market to themselves for years.The price may be lower, but the build isn’t going plastic. Apple is sticking with an aluminium chassis for the J700, and to keep costs in check, it has developed a new forging technique that makes the shells faster and cheaper to produce than the unibody enclosures on the Air and Pro. There’s a chance this method could eventually roll out to Apple’s pricier laptops too.That said, compromises will show up elsewhere. The MacBook is expected to ship with just 8GB of memory, fewer USB-C ports, and a lower-quality LCD panel.Analyst estimates place the final price somewhere in the $699 to $750 range.Where Apple is getting adventurous is colour. Gurman says the company has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray finishes over the past year—though not all will make the final cut. The playful palette takes a page from the 24-inch iMac’s colourful lineup and is a sharp departure from the muted tones MacBook buyers are used to.A March launch is looking likely, which would make the J700 Apple’s first real swing at the budget laptop market in a long time.","The MacBook J700 will run on an A-series chip similar to those found in iPhones.

Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","UAE has announced a strategic global partnership with Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX.

UAE's new AI school policy

Using AI during formal examinations or official assessments is completely banned.

Students cannot submit AI-generated assignments, essays, or projects as their own work. Any use of AI must be explicitly disclosed and approved by a teacher beforehand.

Simply rephrasing what a bot says isn't enough. Students must demonstrate a genuine personal understanding of the content. If a student cannot explain the ""why"" behind an AI-assisted answer, it’s a violation.

The future





The UAE has officially drawn a line in the digital sand. As artificial intelligence becomes as common as a calculator, the Ministry of Education has released the ""Safe and Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms 2026"" guide.This comprehensive framework introduces 25 specific prohibitions designed to ensure that while students learn about the future, they don’t lose their ability to think for themselves today.The most significant change is a firm age limit. Students under the age of 13, or those enrolled in any grade below Year 7 (Grade 6), are now strictly prohibited from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT.The Ministry’s reasoning is clear: early education must be built on human interaction, tactile creativity, and independent problem-solving. By keeping AI out of primary classrooms, the government aims to prevent younger learners from developing a ""digital crutch"" before they have mastered the fundamentals of critical thinking and social-emotional skills.For older students who are permitted to use AI, the rules are rigorous. The Ministry has made it clear that AI is a ""tutor,"" not a ""ghostwriter.""The UAE is ensuring that AI tools reflect the country’s unique cultural fabric.The guidelines prohibit creating or sharing any AI content that contradicts Islamic values, national identity, or cultural ethics.Beyond cultural safeguards, the rules ban AI-generated material that includes:In an era of data harvesting, the Ministry has turned schools into a ""data fortress."" There is a total ban on uploading personal information, including names, photos, audio recordings, or ID details, of students, teachers, or parents into any AI platform.Furthermore, schools are prohibited from using unapproved AI services. This means no bypassing school firewalls with VPNs and no creating student accounts on external platforms that require personal data without official Ministry clearance. Even recording or transcribing a classroom discussion using AI now requires the explicit consent of everyone in the room.The ministry’s manual reinforces that AI should function as a support tool, not a shortcut. Students must critically review and verify AI-generated content before using it in their work, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Teachers are expected to guide students on ethical AI practices and help them understand both the capabilities and limitations of generative tools.While these rules seem strict, they aren't about fearing technology, they’re about mastering it. Starting in the 2025-2026 academic year, the UAE is making AI a mandatory subject from Kindergarten to Grade 12.Taught by over 1,000 specially trained educators, this curriculum focuses on the ethics and mechanics of AI. The goal is to graduate a generation that doesn't just know how to prompt a bot, but understands the algorithms, data privacy, and ethical responsibilities that power the modern world.In the UAE, the message is loud and clear: technology will support the teacher, but it will never replace the human mind.","UAE bans under 13s from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT in schools.

"Mysterious tunnels found beneath 5,000-year-old pagan graves in Germany leave experts stunned",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/mysterious-tunnels-found-beneath-5000-year-old-pagan-graves-in-germany-leave-experts-stunned/articleshow/128133862.cms,"Where the tunnels were found

What was found inside the tunnel





Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site, a discovery that has surprised experts and raised new questions about how different eras interacted with the same landscape. The find was announced in a January 29 press release by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology of Saxony-Anhalt, following excavations near Reinstedt. While the graves date back roughly 5,000 years to the Neolithic period, the underground passage was dug thousands of years later, during the late Middle Ages, creating a rare overlap of prehistoric and medieval activity at a single site.The tunnels were found within a Middle Neolithic burial complex associated with the Baalberge culture, which flourished in the 4th millennium BC. The site consists of a large ditch enclosure and several poorly preserved burials that were originally used for ritual and funerary purposes. Excavations were carried out ahead of planned wind turbine construction, a routine process in Germany that often precedes large infrastructure projects.Archaeologists initially believed they were uncovering a grave after encountering a trapezoidal pit and a stone slab at one end.Further excavation revealed that the feature continued downward into the loess subsoil and was in fact an erdstall, a narrow underground tunnel system typically dated to the late Middle Ages. Erdstalls are found in parts of Central Europe, but their purpose has long remained unclear.The underground passage contained late medieval pottery, an iron horseshoe, animal remains, numerous stones and traces of charcoal from a brief fire. At the narrowest point of the entrance, archaeologists found larger stones stacked together, suggesting the tunnel was intentionally sealed. These finds confirmed that the structure was man-made, used for a period of time, and deliberately closed.The most striking aspect of the discovery is its location. Medieval builders chose to dig the tunnel directly beneath a prehistoric pagan burial site, a decision that archaeologists say was unlikely to be accidental. One theory is that the ancient earthworks were still visible in the Middle Ages and provided a convenient landmark. Another possibility is cultural: medieval Christian communities may have avoided disturbing pagan graves, making such sites discreet places for hidden structures.The function of erdstalls remains debated. Scholars have suggested they may have served as temporary hiding places, storage spaces, or sites for ritual or cultic activity. The narrow dimensions of the Reinstedt tunnel and the limited evidence of long-term occupation support the idea of short-term or episodic use, rather than permanent habitation.","Archaeologists in Germany have uncovered a narrow medieval tunnel system hidden beneath a much older pagan burial site.

Dubai City Walk: A post-iftar social hub for Ramadan 2026



What this means for Dubai residents and visitors





As Ramadan 2026 begins from February 19 or 20, 2026, Dubai is rolling out one of its most ambitious celebration calendars yet, blending traditional spiritual observances with city-wide visual spectacles designed to unite residents, visitors and families after iftar every evening. From night-sky drone light shows to cultural installations and community gatherings, the emirate is turning Ramadan into a vibrant festival of light, art and shared experience under the stars.One of the standout features of Dubai’s 2026 Ramadan calendar is its coordinated drone light shows, which will illuminate the night sky with artistic formations inspired by the holy month. These shows are more than just pretty visuals; they are thematic stories expressed through technology that reflect Ramadan’s spirit of reflection, community and renewal.The drone displays will run nightly from February 19 to March 19, inviting audiences across the city to look up and engage with light as a medium of cultural storytelling. Dubai’s use of drones, a hallmark of its contemporary festival culture, represents a fusion of tradition and innovation in public celebrations.In addition to drones, fireworks displays will enliven key locations like Al Seef and Dubai Creek throughout Ramadan, creating shared moments of spectacle shortly after sunset.These fireworks, timed for post-iftar evenings, are designed to enhance the festive ambience of the season and give families and communities something to look forward to each night.The combination of fireworks and drones mirrors Dubai’s approach to past celebrations, like New Year’s Eve events and shopping festivals, where visual performances play a central role in citywide gatherings.Beyond aerial shows, Dubai is hosting “Ramadan Reflections (Atyaf Ramadaniyah)”, a large-scale series of visual and cultural installations across 10 public locations, including Al Seef and Dubai Festival City Mall. These spaces will feature artistic expressions, from light sculptures to narrative art, that evoke the soulful essence of Ramadan through reflection and ambience.These installations are designed to complement evening routines: prayer, iftar, family walks, and community interactions. Residents can explore themed exhibits while strolling or dining, making the evenings both reflective and energising.Another highlight on the Ramadan calendar is the evening programming at City Walk, which opens its space to extended entertainment, dining and cultural interaction from February 17 to March 18. With ambient décor and a relaxed atmosphere, City Walk aims to be a central post-iftar gathering spot where friends and families connect over food and cultural activities.This initiative reflects Dubai’s broader effort to balance spiritual observance with inclusive social experiences, particularly in open-air venues where residents can enjoy the cooler night air and Ramadan ambience together.Dubai’s festive calendar, combining religious tradition with modern spectacle, highlights how the city embraces Ramadan as both a sacred period of reflection and an opportunity to bring communities together.

Many residents are embracing active lifestyles, even during fasting, opting for night-time walks, jogging and social sports after iftar, a trend also seen in urban sports arenas and public parks. Cultural Immersion: For expats and long-term residents alike, iftar hikes offer a meaningful way to engage with the spiritual rhythm of Ramadan beyond traditional indoor gatherings. They provide a fresh perspective on fasting, blending silence, reflection and nature, while fostering new friendships across diverse communities.

Are UAE's Ramadan Iftar Hikes the New Spiritual Escape?





As Ramadan 2026 unfolds, a rising trend among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is capturing attention: iftar hikes or organised group treks in the Hajar Mountains and desert landscapes where people break their fast together in nature’s calm, far from city life. What began as informal outings has evolved into a vibrant seasonal ritual that blends spiritual reflection, community bonding and healthy outdoor activity against stunning backdrops as the sun sets.Across the UAE, hiking groups are increasingly scheduling mountain treks timed around iftar (sunset), when fasting Muslims break their fast with dates, water and light meals after a day of fasting. Hikers gather with backpacks instead of dining tables an hour before sunset, reaching trails or scenic vantage points by the call to prayer and enjoying a simple, shared moment before continuing their adventure.Organised groups like UAE Adventures Team and Outdoorzy Adventures have been running these experiences for several years, particularly in cooler winter months leading into Ramadan when outdoor temperatures are friendlier for physical activity. These outings prioritise accessibility, offering easy-to-moderate hikes in places like Fossil Rock in Mleiha and other elevated trails where panoramic views enrich the fast-breaking moment.According to some UAE Muslims, there is something uniquely meaningful about breaking the fast outdoors, away from everyday distractions and electronic devices. The simplicity of sharing dates and water with fellow hikers at sunset, followed by prayers in nature, resonates deeply with many. As one group founder put it, iftar hikes offer “a rare pause”, a moment to feel connected to both community and the spiritual spirit of Ramadan.Many journeys continue after the initial breaking of the fast: groups pause for Maghrib prayer, then hike for a few more hours under the night sky and sometimes finish the evening with suhoor barbecues or meals overlooking the mountains. The emphasis, hikers explain, is not on strenuous exercise but on shared experience, contemplation and fellowship, aligning outdoor adventure with the values of generosity and togetherness that define Ramadan.Unlike typical organised sports or fitness trends, iftar hikes are rooted in cultural adaptation and community spirit. They are scheduled with consideration for fasting participants, often starting after taraweeh prayers so there is ample time to digest iftar before physical exertion and they tend to be small, capped at 25–30 people for safety, especially when hiking after dark.Groups usually include both fasting and non-fasting participants, with organisers mindful to respect the needs of those observing the fast, for example, non-fasting hikers refrain from drinking water in front of others during the hike.Several factors are helping fuel the popularity of iftar hikes during Ramadan -Organisers of iftar hikes emphasise safety, especially since many hikes continue after dark. Small group sizes, often no more than 25 to 30 participants, help ensure that leaders can manage the risk of night hiking in rugged terrain. Participants are also briefed on safety protocols and trail conditions ahead of time.Given the varied terrain of the UAE’s Hajar Mountains including peaks like Jebel Al Mebrah and Jabal Qada’ah in Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, hikers are advised to come prepared with appropriate gear, flashlights or headlamps, and a plan for hydration once iftar is officially called.Iftar hikes are part of a broader social shift in the UAE during Ramadan where residents embrace outdoor and community-focused activities. For example, many people choose to exercise after iftar by jogging, playing football or visiting public spaces, turning late evenings into a hub for wellness and social connection. Likewise, community programmes like Umm Al Emarat Park’s Ramadan Nights events showcase how outdoor gatherings are now an integral part of the UAE’s Ramadan experience, combining cultural celebration with family-friendly engagement under the night sky.In 2026, iftar hikes have emerged as a symbolic expression of how people in the UAE are reimagining Ramadan traditions. They offer a blend of reflection, fitness, community spirit and adventure that complements the core values of the holy month. Far from being merely a fitness fad, these hikes reflect a deeper desire to connect with nature, share meaningful moments and embrace the spiritual essence of Ramadan with one sunset, one trail, one shared meal at a time.","Ramadan falls during a cool winter period in the UAE in 2026, making mountain and desert hikes more comfortable than in summer months.

French and Egyptian institutions lead excavation

Alexandria lighthouse shaped ancient maritime trade





Off the coast of Alexandria, divers and cranes have returned to a site that has rested underwater for centuries. Large stone blocks linked to the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria are being lifted from the seabed as part of a renewed archaeological effort. The structure, known as Pharos, once stood at the entrance to the city’s harbour and was counted among the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Thirty years after underwater remains were first identified in 1995, researchers are now raising selected architectural pieces for detailed study. The work forms part of the PHAROS project, a French-led programme that aims to document, scan and digitally reconstruct the lighthouse using both recovered blocks and fragments mapped beneath the Mediterranean. Dassault Systems Foundation , which has supported the technological aspects of the project, has lifted 22 of the largest surviving blocks. Some weigh between 70 and 80 tonnes. The pieces include monumental door lintels, jambs, a threshold and large base slabs. Among the finds is part of a previously unknown pylon featuring an Egyptian style doorway dating to the Hellenistic period. The scale of the stones gives a sense of the lighthouse’s original mass.Each block is being studied on land before further analysis.The recovered elements will be scanned and processed using photogrammetry. They will join more than 100 blocks already digitised underwater over the past decade. Engineers working with La Fondation Dassault Systèmes will analyse the data and attempt to reposition each piece in a virtual environment.The aim is to test different hypotheses about how the lighthouse was constructed and how it eventually collapsed. Using simulations, the team plans to create a digital twin of the structure. This model could allow viewers to explore a detailed reconstruction of Pharos without rebuilding it physically.The excavation is being conducted by the CNRS through its permanent unit in Egypt, under the authority of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The project has received financial support from La Fondation Dassault Systèmes over the past three years.Researchers are also collecting ancient texts, coins and visual depictions of the lighthouse. These sources help fill gaps left by the fragmented remains. Much of the structure was dismantled after it stopped operating in 1303, with stones later reused in the construction of the Qaitbay Fortress in 1477.Built in the early third century BCE under Ptolemy I, the lighthouse is believed to have stood about 100 metres tall. It guided ships along a difficult coastline and became a symbol of the city’s status in Mediterranean trade. No ancient lighthouse of similar scale survives today. The current work in Alexandria is less about spectacle and more about patient reconstruction. Piece by piece, the outline becomes clearer, though still incomplete.","Egypt has lifted 22 of the largest surviving blocks. Some weigh between 70 and 80 tonnes.

Viral diving video turns dangerous: Oman issues urgent warning after man swims with killer whale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/viral-diving-video-turns-dangerous-oman-issues-urgent-warning-after-man-swims-with-killer-whale/articleshow/128372073.cms,"Viral Whale Video Sparks Safety Alert: Oman Authorities Say This Could Be Deadly

Why the Oman orca whale advisory came now: Viral video sparks concern



Orca whale behaviour and marine safety in Oman



Oman guidelines for viewing marine wildlife safely



Observe marine life from a boat or a safe distance rather than attempting to approach in the water.

Avoid diving or swimming near large marine mammals, especially orcas, which can swim quickly and unpredictably.

Let sightings be a moment of appreciation rather than an excuse for risky behaviour.

Marine encounters in Oman: A rare but captivating sight



What this means for divers and tourists in Oman







Oman’s Environment Authority has issued a public warning urging people not to dive near orca whales (killer whales) after a video showing a man swimming close to the massive marine predators went viral online. The authority cautioned residents and visitors that attempting to approach or film these powerful animals up close is unsafe and unpredictable and could jeopardise both human lives and wildlife wellbeing.The advisory comes in response to a widely shared video that showed an individual diving close to an orca off the Omani coast in an apparent effort to film it underwater. According to local authorities, such behaviour is “incorrect and poses a serious risk to personal safety.”The Environment Authority of Oman explained that orcas, also known as killer whales, are wild animals with unpredictable behaviour and immense strength. They emphasised that orcas are not trained animals and approaching them closely in their natural habitat can trigger defensive or aggressive responses if the animals feel threatened.Orca whales (Orcinus orca) are among the most powerful predators in the ocean, known for their intelligence, cooperative hunting and dominance within marine ecosystems. While attacks on humans in the wild are rare, experts and wildlife agencies worldwide stress that close encounters with orcas should be avoided for safety reasons.The Oman warning echoes similar guidance that authorities and conservation groups give in other parts of the world, where orca sightings attract attention but require strict distance and respect to avoid startling or provoking the animals.To balance public interest with wildlife protection, Oman’s Environment Authority urged people to:This is not only a safety measure for humans but also supports the well-being of wildlife, since close human presence can disrupt natural behaviour or stress animals.Orca sightings in the Arabian Sea and Gulf region, including off the coasts of Oman and the UAE, are relatively uncommon, making them notable when they occur. Previous reports have even documented orca sightings near UAE waters, which sparked interest from conservationists and the general public alike.While orcas are not common in the Arabian Gulf, they have been seen periodically, highlighting the importance of coastal conservation efforts and public awareness around marine life.Oman’s advisory serves as a reminder to snorkellers, divers, and marine enthusiasts that wildlife encounters are best experienced cautiously and respectfully. Even curious or awe-inspiring moments should not override basic safety principles, especially with large predators that can weigh several tonnes and move unpredictably.Authorities are using the viral incident as a teaching moment where while technology and social media encourage close-up footage, safety for both humans and animals should always come first. As orca sightings capture public imagination, Oman’s Environment Authority has stepped in with a clear message: watch from afar, respect wildlife and never dive near a wild predator for a viral clip. Encouraging safe, sustainable ways to enjoy the ocean not only protects people but also preserves the natural behaviour and habitat of marine giants like the orca whale.",Oman’s Environment Authority has issued a public warning urging people not to dive near orca whales (killer whales) A video showing a man swimming close to the massive marine predators went viral online.

‘Gold bars’ at Saudi wedding?

A 33-second wedding video has set social media abuzz after appearing to show 24-carat gold bars being handed out as gifts. The clip, widely circulated online, prompted disbelief and debate as viewers tried to make sense of what looked like solid gold biscuits distributed during a ceremony reportedly held in Saudi Arabia.The footage shows a group of well-dressed men seated at a wedding function while another man moves between them carrying a box filled with gleaming yellow bars. Claims accompanying the video suggested the gifts were presented by the bride’s brother to members of the groom’s family. Some online described the gesture as “royal”, while others dismissed it as excessive showmanship.As the clip continued to circulate, a debate quickly emerged over whether the display was genuine or staged. Some viewers were convinced the bars were real 24-carat gold, pointing to their size and presentation. Others questioned the claim, arguing that the shine and uniform appearance looked more decorative than precious metal.However, the bars shown in the video are not real gold.What appeared to be gold biscuits were in fact luxury chocolates wrapped in gold-coloured foil, crafted to resemble bullion. Several users identified them as products from Patchi, a premium chocolate brand known for its gold-wrapped assortments that are commonly exchanged at weddings and celebratory gatherings across parts of the Middle East.As speculation grew, one user asked Grok, whether the footage was authentic. Grok responded that the event itself appeared genuine and likely from a Saudi wedding, but clarified that the “24-karat gold biscuits” were chocolates designed to mimic gold bars. According to the response, the caption suggesting solid gold gifts was misleading.One commenter wrote that the entire box was worth less than $50 and had “nothing to do with original gold”, while others noted that such luxury confectionery is frequently used to create an opulent visual effect during high-profile events.Once the clarification surfaced, the conversation shifted from astonishment to amusement. What initially appeared to be an extravagant display of bullion turned out to be a carefully presented box of sweets.The episode offers a reminder of how easily presentation can fuel assumptions online. In an age where visuals travel faster than context, even a box of chocolates can momentarily pass for treasure.","Viral video appears to show 24-carat gold bars being handed out as gifts at a wedding in Saudi Arabia.

Why Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble feels cool even in peak summer?

Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India) Series D





Anyone who has walked barefoot around the Kaaba in peak summer knows the feeling. The sun is relentless, the air heavy with heat, yet the marble underfoot does not burn. In a place where temperatures regularly climb past 45°C, that small detail leaves many quietly puzzled.The courtyard surrounding the Kaaba is paved with high-quality, light-coloured marble widely identified as Thassos marble. This dolomitic stone is known for its high solar reflectance and low heat absorption coefficient. Rather than absorbing and storing solar radiation like darker paving materials, it reflects a significant portion of incoming sunlight. As a result, surface temperatures remain markedly lower than materials such as concrete or asphalt, even under prolonged exposure to direct sun.Scientific research has examined this behaviour in detail. A 2022 study published in the, titled Investigating the Unique Thermal Properties of Thassos Marble , analysed the thermophysical characteristics of the stone. Researchers found that Thassos marble demonstrates higher thermal conductivity than conventional white marble. This allows heat to disperse more efficiently through the material instead of accumulating at the surface.The study also highlighted that the marble’s microstructure and mineral composition enhance both reflectivity and internal heat redistribution.Complementing these findings, a 2021 peer-reviewed study titled Cool White Marble Pavement Thermophysical Assessment at Al Masjid Al-Haram, Makkah City, Saudi Arabia . Using local weather data and thermal modelling under real climatic conditions, researchers concluded that the marble’s high reflectance significantly reduces surface temperatures. The study determined that the use of cool white marble plays a critical role in maintaining safe and comfortable walking conditions for barefoot pilgrims.The cooling effect is reinforced by structural design. The marble slabs are thick and installed over specialised insulating layers and air-permeable spaces. This layered configuration enables heat to dissipate downward and sideways rather than remaining concentrated at the surface. The expansive open-air layout of the Grand Mosque allows continuous airflow across the courtyard, while the steady movement of worshippers contributes to ground-level air circulation.What appears to be a simple stone surface is, in reality, a carefully engineered thermal system. Through the integration of high-reflectance marble, enhanced thermal conductivity, layered insulation and architectural airflow, the Mataf maintains moderated surface temperatures in one of the world’s hottest urban environments.",Makkah’s Grand Mosque marble stays cool in peak summer due to solar reflectance and layered insulation.

Sharjah’s vintage celebration aims to recreate the cultural energy of the era through environments evocative of living rooms, arcades and pop-culture hangouts of the time.Visitors will find sections dedicated to classic gaming, where cartridge consoles featuring likes of Sega and early PlayStation games take centre stage, along with a memory wall encouraging attendees to reconnect with treasured personal moments from their youth.In addition to games and artefacts, the festival features open-air cinema screenings showing beloved films and TV moments from the decade, allowing guests to revisit favourite entertainment experiences under the stars.Music will be a key pillar of the event’s programming, with DJ sets, curated playlists and live performances inspired by chart-topping hits of the 1990s. Expect the anthems that dominated Walkmans, car stereos and TV music shows, from pop and rock to early hip-hop and dance tracks, all designed to immerse attendees in the familiar rhythms that shaped a generation’s cultural identity.Large screens throughout the venue will showcase iconic movies and television highlights, emphasising the era’s memorable pop-cultural moments while offering attendees a shared, communal viewing experience reminiscent of family movie nights and outdoor screenings.No nostalgic festival would be complete without food and this event’s menu leans into classic diner-style fare reminiscent of 1990s comfort cuisine. Visitors can enjoy burgers, milkshakes, fries and other favourites that evoke the tastes and flavours of the decade, adding a sensory element to the overall retro experience.Food stalls and themed eateries scattered across the grounds aim to complement the pop-culture ambience, offering both older visitors and younger attendees a taste of the era’s most cherished culinary staples. The retro festival is emerging during a busy festival season in Sharjah, alongside multiple cultural and community-driven events in 2026 that continue the emirate’s commitment to creative engagement and tourism.Earlier in February, the 23rd Sharjah Heritage Days finished a multi-city celebration of Emirati and global folk culture, featuring traditional music, performances and heritage displays in the historic Heart of Sharjah. In addition, Sharjah’s broader events calendar shows a spectrum of experiences, from literature and animation festivals to Ramadan celebrations, that are attracting diverse audiences and reinforcing the emirate’s growing reputation as a cultural hub in the UAE.The 1990s revival festival is tapping into a powerful current of nostalgia and pop-culture fascination that resonates across generations. Millennials who grew up in the decade, as well as younger visitors curious about the era’s styles, media and tech, find in this festival an opportunity to relive and reinterpret shared cultural touchstones.The event also aligns with a broader trend of retro and vintage festivals worldwide, where communities celebrate music, fashion, games and media from past decades as a form of collective memory and intergenerational connection. By bringing this experience to the UAE, Sharjah positions itself at the intersection of culture, entertainment and tourism, attracting both residents and international visitors.Set across open-air and indoor spaces, the festival welcomes attendees daily from 4 pm to midnight, allowing families, young adults and night-owl festival-goers alike to explore at leisure. The venue, the Sharjah Research, Technology and Innovation Park, is easily accessible and provides immersive stages and installations designed to make attendees feel transported back in time.Whether you are reliving your own 1990s memories or discovering them for the first time, the event promises a shared social experience rooted in nostalgia, community and cultural curiosity. Sharjah’s 1990s-inspired vintage festival is more than just an event; it is a cultural flashback that blends music, film, games and retro lifestyle moments into a multi-sensory celebration of an iconic decade.As a part of Sharjah’s wider schedule of festivals and cultural showcases, it underscores the emirate’s vibrant role in the UAE’s cultural calendar and its ability to host events that entertain, educate and connect people of all ages through shared memories and experiences.","Sharjah will host one of the largest 1990s-inspired vintage festivals in the UAE.

UAE Indians: Are You Ready for India's New Chip-Enabled e-Passport?

e-Passport application process for UAE residents







Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport , a modern travel document designed to make international journeys faster, safer and more secure while aligning with global immigration standards. The rollout is part of India’s Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), which modernises passport services through digital platforms and stronger security features.Unlike traditional passports, the e-Passport embeds a secure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip that stores the holder’s biometric data, including photograph and fingerprints, in encrypted form directly inside the booklet. The presence of the embedded chip is usually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.This RFID-equipped document conforms to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, meaning it is recognised globally for automated identity verification and enhanced security. UAE-based Indians can now apply for these e-Passports through the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate in Dubai, with the rollout officially starting in October 2025 under GPSP 2.0.One of the biggest advantages of the e-Passport is reduced immigration wait times, travellers using automated lanes such as SmartGates and e-gates at airports can move through border control much more quickly compared with manual checks.Reports indicate that such streamlined checks can cut average wait times from roughly 25 minutes to under five at key UAE airports.These faster channels are not limited to the UAE as Indian e-Passport holders may benefit from automated border controls in countries such as Singapore, Australia and others that support e-Passport infrastructure, making travel smoother for frequent flyers.The embedded chip in the e-Passport uses advanced encryption and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to ensure that biometric and identity data is securely stored and authenticated at international checkpoints. This makes it significantly harder for fraudsters to tamper with or forge passport information, enhancing overall travel document integrity.Such security upgrades align with global efforts to reduce passport fraud and identity theft, giving travellers and authorities more confidence in document authenticity.The shift to e-Passports is part of a larger digital overhaul under Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), an upgraded system for issuing passports that emphasises ease of application, transparency and online services. GPSP 2.0 enables applicants to upload photographs, signatures and documents online, reducing reliance on physical forms and cutting waiting times at service centres like BLS International.For Indian residents in the UAE, estimated at around 3.5 million, this means a digital, end-to-end passport application experience that lowers bureaucratic friction and improves user convenience.Yes, existing passports without a chip remain valid until their expiration. Indian missions in the UAE have clarified that no extra biometrics or fees are required solely because of the e-Passport rollout. Applicants who provided biometrics recently will not be asked to give them again just because of the new document type.However, travellers planning long-term travel or frequent international journeys are encouraged to transition early to the e-Passport to enjoy the full suite of benefits proactively.From October 28, 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE, including renewals and new passports, must be filed through the GPSP 2.0 portal, which supports online registration, document upload and appointment booking at BLS centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Applicants should ensure their photographs comply with ICAO standards to avoid delays or rejection. These strict photo requirements were introduced in September 2025 and apply to all passport applications, including e-Passports.India’s new chip-enabled e-Passport represents a major leap in travel document technology, offering faster immigration processing, enhanced security and future-proof compatibility with global systems. For UAE-based Indians, applying now through the modern GPSP 2.0 digital process can mean smoother travel experiences both within the Gulf and around the world.","Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport.

Early birds still get the best deals, especially in Economy Class



When is the Cheapest Time to Book Emirates Flights in 2026?

Takeaway:

Best booking windows: Strategy and seasonal trends



6–8 weeks before departure often yields lower Economy fares than booking at the last minute, especially for long-haul flights.

Booking mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) rather than weekends may further increase odds of a deal because airlines frequently adjust prices to stimulate bookings on slower days.

Off-peak travel months, such as shoulder seasons outside summer and major holidays, tend to offer better pricing than peak times like July or late December.

Use Emirates’ own tools and guarantees



Low Fare Calendar: Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows.

Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows. Best Price Guarantee: If you find a lower price elsewhere for the exact same Emirates flight, the airline promises to refund the difference (terms apply).

Mid-week and time-of-day tips



Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel.

Some data, for airlines in general, suggest booking at odd hours (late night or early morning) can reveal hidden dips in dynamic pricing, though this is not specific to Emirates’ own official pricing logic.

Avoid last-minute and peak season rushes



Emirates Price Gouging Exposed? How to Beat Their Booking Secrets in 2026

Watch international route demand



Keep an eye on discounts and promo codes



Consider points and loyalty for even more savings



Practical checklist for lower Emirates fares in 2026



Plan and book 2–3 months ahead for best value, especially for Economy travel.

Use Emirates’ Low Fare Calendar and Best Price Guarantee features.

Search and book mid-week rather than weekends.

Travel in shoulder seasons and off-peak months.

Sign up for fare alerts and promo codes.

Consider accumulating and redeeming Skywards miles for longer-term savings.





If you are planning to fly with Emirates in 2026, whether for leisure, family trips or work, timing your booking right can make a significant difference in airfare costs. According to reports, Emirates just recorded its busiest January for family travel ever, with the majority of passengers booking two to three months in advance, showing that early planning often leads to better pricing and seat availability.Here’s how travelers can navigate Emirates pricing trends and save on flights this year.Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure, particularly during school holiday periods and major travel seasons. More than 65% of family and group bookings happened at least two to three months before departure and that early demand helped the airline fill planes without resorting to heavy discounting later.Booking early, around 2–3 months before travel, increases chances of finding lower fares, especially for Economy and window seats on popular international routes.Industry fare trackers, including those used by travel experts, suggest some general sweet spots for airline bookings that align with Emirates pricing patterns:These timing strategies, while not unique to Emirates, are broadly supported by airfare analytics across global carriers and hint at fare behaviour that dynamic pricing systems often follow.Emirates offers some built-in online tools that can help budget-minded travelers -Using these features directly on emirates.com can ensure you are not overpaying and may unlock savings you would not find on third-party sites.Travel experts say fare fluctuations are influenced by how busy search engines and airlines’ pricing algorithms are at various times:Being flexible not only with how far ahead you book but also with your departure and return days can help uncover lower ticket prices.Historically, Emirates, like most airlines, charges a premium for last-minute bookings. Data suggest that fares typically increase sharply in the last few weeks before travel, especially during popular holiday windows like spring breaks, summer vacations and year-end festivals.That pattern echoes broader airline pricing behaviour, where demand surges close to departure force up prices as remaining seats get scarcer.Travel patterns show Emirates passengers prioritise family and group travel to destinations such as Dubai, Jeddah, Istanbul, Bangkok and Rome, often linked to school calendars and tourism peak periods and those patterns can push pricing up early.If your schedule allows flexibility, consider flying to high-demand destinations outside peak holiday periods to lock in better rates.While not specific to Emirates’ official pricing, some travel platforms and deal sites list seasonal promo codes and airline discounts (like 10% off offers) that can occasionally apply to Emirates bookings. These deals are typically time-limited and require quick action to redeem.Sign up for newsletter alerts, airline membership programs (e.g., Emirates Skywards) and fare trackers to catch these short-term discounts.If you fly often, Emirates’ Skywards loyalty program can further reduce effective costs through miles redemption for flights or upgrades, especially if you accumulate points via partners or co-branded credit cards. For travelers aiming to reduce fare expenses over time, this is a long-term strategy worth exploring alongside smart booking timing.For travellers eyeing better Emirates flight prices in 2026, timing is still one of the most powerful tools. The early-booking trend revealed in recent travel patterns indicates that passengers securing tickets months in advance, particularly for family travel in Economy Class, enjoy more competitive pricing and smoother travel planning.By combining early planning, flexible dates, smart fare search tools and loyalty programs, you can significantly improve your odds of finding lower Emirates airfare and stretching your travel budget farther.",Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

‘No discussions for specific operations’: Anthropic denies Claude’s use by US military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-discussions-for-specific-operations-anthropic-denies-claudes-use-by-us-military/articleshow/128370317.cms,".





AI firm Anthropic has stated that it has not held discussions with the US's department of war regarding the use of its AI system, Claude, for specific operations.""Anthropic has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war,"" the AI firm said, as cited by Reuters.Meanwhile, the Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its relationship with Anthropic over the company’s restrictions on how its models are used, Axios reported on Saturday, citing a senior administration official.The US military has asked four leading AI labs to allow the use of their tools for “all lawful purposes,” including sensitive areas such as weapons development, intelligence gathering, and battlefield operations. Anthropic has not agreed to these terms, leading to mounting frustration within the Pentagon after months of difficult negotiations.Anthropic has maintained that two areas must remain off-limits: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weaponry. A senior administration official noted that there is significant ambiguity over what falls within these categories, making it impractical for the Pentagon to negotiate individual use cases with Anthropic or risk the AI system, Claude, unexpectedly blocking certain applications.Tensions between the Pentagon and Anthropic escalated after The Wall Street Journal reported that the US military used Anthropic’s artificial intelligence model, Claude, during the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Claude was reportedly deployed as part of Anthropic’s collaboration with data analytics company Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are extensively used by the US department of defence and federal law enforcement agencies.In early January, US forces captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife during strikes on multiple sites in Caracas, and Maduro was flown to New York to face federal drug trafficking charges.Anthropic’s usage policies explicitly prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons, or conduct surveillance. The Wall Street Journal reports that the AI model was involved in a raid that included bombing operation, whichs has drawn attention to how artificial intelligence tools are being deployed in military contexts and whether existing safeguards are effective.According to the report, disagreements over the Pentagon’s desired use of Claude have contributed to growing tensions between the AI firm and US defence officials, with some administration officials considering cancelling a contract worth up to $200 million.Anthropic was reportedly the first AI developer whose model was used in classified operations by the department of defence, though it remains unclear whether other AI systems were used in the Venezuela mission for unclassified tasks.Claude is an advanced artificial intelligence chatbot and large language model developed by US-based AI company Anthropic. Designed for tasks such as text generation, reasoning, coding, and data analysis, Claude competes with other large language models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.The system can summarise documents, answer complex queries, generate reports, assist with programming, and analyse large volumes of text.","Anthropic says it has not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the department of war.

How the Know Your Rights app help immigrants

Recognition and next steps





Fourteen-year-old Julian Miramontes from Los Angeles has earned national recognition for creating a mobile app designed to help immigrants understand their legal rights. An eighth grader at El Sereno Middle School, Miramontes developed the Know Your Rights app after witnessing fear and uncertainty in his community linked to immigration enforcement. The app explains key constitutional protections and uses short quizzes to make complex legal concepts easier to understand. His project won the Congressional App Challenge in California’s 34th Congressional District.Julian Miramontes is a middle school student from the El Sereno neighbourhood of Los Angeles with an early interest in technology and coding. He developed his skills through school-based STEM programmes and is described by teachers and family members as curious and community-minded. Rather than focusing on competition, his work reflects an effort to use technology to respond to real-life issues affecting people around him.Miramontes has said the idea for the app came from seeing how immigration raids and enforcement actions created fear and confusion in his neighbourhood. Many people did not know what their legal rights were during encounters with federal agents. With guidance from his STEM teacher, he designed the app as a quick, reliable resource that could be used during stressful situations.The Know Your Rights app explains basic constitutional protections in clear language, including the right to remain silent. Information is broken into short sections and reinforced through simple multiple-choice quizzes that help users check their understanding. The design focuses on clarity, speed, and accessibility, making the app usable for people without legal training who need information quickly.The Know Your Rights app won the Congressional App Challenge in California’s 34th Congressional District, a nationwide competition that encourages middle and high school students to create apps addressing community needs. As a district winner, Miramontes received a cash prize and an invitation to travel to Washington, DC, to meet other student winners.His parents said the project reflects both his technical ability and his concern for others. US Representative Jimmy Gomez praised the app for addressing fear in the community and meeting the goals of the competition. The app is not publicly available and can currently be accessed only through a shared link, but it has drawn positive attention online. Miramontes has said his focus remains on helping people feel informed and less afraid.",Julian Miramontes developed the Know Your Rights app after witnessing fear and uncertainty in his community linked to immigration enforcement.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.
