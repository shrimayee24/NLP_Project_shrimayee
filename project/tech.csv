Ghibli Style Image: How to create Ghibli-style Portraits without paying for ChatGPT Plus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-to-create-ghibli-style-portraits-without-paying-for-chatgpt-plus/articleshow/119581346.cms,"Here's how to create your own Ghibli-style portraits for free.

Use Gemini or Grok

Explore Free Third-Party Tools

Use Free Trials on Premium AI Platforms

With ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest GPT-4o update sparking a viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style portraits , social media is buzzing with ethereal, anime-inspired photos. However, this feature, rolled out on Tuesday, March 25, is currently limited to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Select subscription tiers, leaving free-tier users out of the fun—at least for now. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced Wednesday that overwhelming demand has delayed the feature's rollout to free users, meaning those on the basic plan can't tap into the native image-generation capabilities of GPT-4o or Sora. But don't worry: you don't need ChatGPT Plus to join the Ghibli fest.AI models like Gemini or Grok can also create Studio Ghibli-style visuals—think lush greenery, soft lighting, and expressive characters—provided you're precise with your prompts, such as ""a serene Ghibli-style girl with flowing hair under a cherry blossom tree.""However, the output might differ from ChatGPT's GPT-4o creations, as each model interprets styles uniquely due to differences in training data and algorithms. While ChatGPT's images lean toward photorealistic finesse, Gemini, Grok, or trial-based platforms might produce a slightly more abstract or varied take on Ghibli's charm, requiring some experimentation to nail the vibe.You can still transform your photos or ideas into Studio Ghibli-inspired art without a ChatGPT subscription. Free platforms like Craiyon, DeepAI, and Playground AI offer AI image generation with varying levels of customization. Simply upload a photo or type a prompt like ""portrait in Studio Ghibli style, lush forest background, soft colors,"" and let the AI work its magic.Again, these tools may not match GPT-4o's photorealistic precision, but they can mimic Ghibli's whimsical aesthetic—think flowing hair, vibrant landscapes, and gentle expressions. For better control, try Artbreeder, which lets you blend images and tweak styles, though some features require a paid upgrade.If you're aiming for higher quality, platforms like Runway ML, Leonardo AI, or Mage.space offer free trials that rival ChatGPT's capabilities. Sign up, upload your image, and use prompts to emulate Ghibli's signature look—dreamy lighting, hand-drawn textures, and nature-infused scenes. These tools often provide more advanced editing options, letting you refine details like Totoro-esque fluffiness or Spirited Away-inspired hues.While ChatGPT Plus users revel in OpenAI's loosened style restrictions, these workarounds prove you don't need a subscription to create Ghibli magic. Experiment, share your results, and join the trend—subscription or not.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest GPT-4o update sparked a viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style portraits.

To protect both the telescope and your eyes, attach a solar filter over the lens. The Seestar S30 includes a built-in solar filter specifically for capturing the sun.

5. Select the cclipse as your imaging target

Open the Seestar App and switch to Solar Mode.

The telescope will automatically locate and track the sun.

Adjust exposure, brightness, and focus settings for optimal image clarity.

"'No tip, no ride’: Bengaluru commuters slam auto apps over unfair tipping system, say 'drivers also demand more money at drop points'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-tip-no-ride-bengaluru-commuters-slam-auto-apps-over-unfair-tipping-system-say-drivers-also-demand-more-money-at-drop-points/articleshow/119687089.cms,"BENGALURU: Passengers using app-based autos are voicing their frustration, claiming they end up paying as much as they would have if they hailed the vehicle on the road. During peak hours, drivers accept bookings only if customers add a tip ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 80, they say. Besides, some drivers allegedly demand additional money at drop points.Mobile apps display messages: 'Adding a tip might help increase the chances of getting a ride faster', 'Now you can set a price that works for you', 'Add a tip for faster pick up', 'A driver may be more likely to accept this ride if you add a tip', 'Your driver receives 100% of the tip. If you add a tip now, you can't change it later', and 'High demand, selected tip helps you find a ride faster'. Passengers say the aggregators appear to be hand in glove with what seems to be a new mode of surge pricing.Niharika B, a passenger, said, ""When I tried to book a cab from Residency Road to Bellandur, the app displayed a fare of Rs 296, which was close to Rs 20 per km. I tried booking without tip but was unable to find an auto despite multiple attempts. It was only after I agreed to pay a tip of Rs 50 that an auto driver accepted the booking. This is happening routinely.""Sushmitha Harish, another passenger, said the auto fare from her home at Ramamurthy Nagar to Byappanahalli Metro station back gate is Rs 75. ""The mobile app I often use charges me Rs 90-100 for it every time. Since last week, I noticed a hike. It charges Rs 110-120. If it charges one-and-a-half or even double, why do I need the help of an app? I might as well bargain with an auto driver myself. It will turn out to be cheaper than going through these apps. Now that the auto fares are going to be revised, booking through apps will become totally unaffordable. The apps were once saviours for us. They became a hit because they understood the pain of a daily commuter and gave a solution to this. Now, they have become bigger fleecers than the auto drivers themselves,"" she said.According to Sushmitha, booking bike taxis using apps is also becoming expensive. ""There are multiple instances of bike taxis accepting bookings only after riders agree to pay a tip that ranges from Rs 10 to Rs 40,"" she said.Another passenger, Navneeth J, said, ""Usually, I book an auto from JP Nagar Metro station to Bannerghatta Road. During peak hours, it is difficult to get an auto without paying a tip. There were several instances of auto drivers demanding more money, citing heavy traffic on Outer Ring Road. The app displays a message that 100% of the fare charged goes to auto drivers, but drivers dispute the claims of aggregators.""Shriman Sharma, a techie from Bellandur, said, ""During peak hours, until I add a tip, I do not get a ride. There are days when the fare would be hiked, and they would be asking you for a tip.""Asked about the legality of tips being charged to book an auto, transport commissioner Yogesh AM said, ""The transport department has no say in tipping the drivers while booking autos using a mobile app."" He said the department is contemplating bringing autos under mobile app-based aggregators' rules.","Mobile apps display messages: 'Adding a tip might help increase the chances of getting a ride faster', 'Add a tip for faster pick up', 'A driver may be more likely to accept this ride if you add a tip', 'Your driver receives 100% of the tip' Passengers say the aggregators appear to be hand in glove with a new mode of surge pricing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119687134,imgsize-100780,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/119687134.jpg"

Skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts are in for a spectacular celestial event as a partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025. This breathtaking phenomenon will follow a total lunar eclipse that took place just weeks earlier, adding to the excitement for stargazers. The eclipse will be particularly visible across parts of the northeastern United States and Canada, where observers will witness the moon partially obscuring the sun at sunrise, creating a stunning crescent-like effect.Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon completely blocks the sun, a partial eclipse leaves a portion of the sun visible, offering a unique viewing experience. This event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. With proper precautions and the right viewing locations, this solar eclipse promises to be a memorable spectacle.According to Space.com, the March 29, 2025, solar eclipse will occur between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The event will be best visible at sunrise across several states in the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada.The following states will have some of the best views of the partial solar eclipse, as reported by USA Today:Additionally, the eclipse will be visible across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. However, visibility will depend on local weather conditions, so clear skies will be essential for an optimal viewing experience.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, but its alignment is not perfect, causing only a portion of the sun to be obscured. The extent to which the sun is covered depends on the observer's location. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.Although partial eclipses do not create the dramatic darkness of a total eclipse, they remain fascinating astronomical events. Observers will notice shadows appearing sharper, temperature drops, and changes in animal behavior during the peak of the eclipse.The March 29, 2025, eclipse is part of a series of solar eclipses that occur as the Earth, moon, and sun align at specific intervals. The moon’s orbital tilt prevents solar eclipses from occurring every month, making them relatively rare events.During a partial solar eclipse, the sun is never fully covered, and the extent of the obscuration depends on the observer's position on Earth. The phenomenon is a reminder of the intricate mechanics of celestial bodies and their predictable yet mesmerizing movements.At sunrise, when the eclipse reaches its peak in North America, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, giving the impression that a large portion of it has been ""bitten off."" As the moon moves along its orbit, the sun will gradually regain its full shape, marking the end of the event.Unlike lunar eclipses, which are safe to view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require special protective measures. Looking directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse, can cause severe retinal damage, often referred to as ""eclipse blindness.""To safely observe the eclipse, experts recommend using:Standard sunglasses are not sufficient for protection and should not be used. Organizations such as NASA and the American Astronomical Society provide guidelines on purchasing certified eclipse glasses to ensure safe viewing.The partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). It will be best visible at sunrise across the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Some of the key locations for optimal viewing include New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia, among others.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun but does not fully cover it. This results in a portion of the sun remaining visible, creating a crescent-like effect. In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely obscures the sun, briefly turning day into night.Viewing a solar eclipse requires proper eye protection. Experts recommend using eclipse glasses that meet ISO 12312-2 safety standards, solar viewing filters, or indirect viewing methods such as pinhole projectors. Standard sunglasses are not safe for eclipse viewing, as they do not provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays.Solar eclipses are rare because the moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon, Earth, and sun do not always align perfectly. Eclipses only occur when their orbits intersect at specific points, leading to either partial or total solar eclipses.Yes, during the peak of the eclipse, observers may notice subtle environmental changes such as a slight drop in temperature, sharper shadows, and altered animal behavior. These effects occur because the reduced sunlight affects both the atmosphere and the natural world.","A partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025.

Ghibli Pronunciation Guide: 'Ghibli' or 'Jibli' - what is the correct way to pronounce it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ghibli-pronunciation-guide-ghibli-or-jibli-what-is-the-correct-way-to-pronounce-it/articleshow/119653720.cms,"Studio Ghibli, the iconic Japanese animation studio founded by legendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki , is beloved worldwide for films like ""Spirited Away,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" and ""Princess Mononoke."" Yet, despite its global fame, there remains significant confusion about the correct pronunciation of its name. Is it ""Ghibli"" with a hard ""G,"" or ""Jibli"" with a soft ""G""?The confusion stems from the studio's origin story and the linguistic journey the word ""Ghibli"" has taken. Initially, ""Ghibli"" (ギブリ) comes from an Italian word pronounced with a hard ""G"" (as in ""gift""). This Italian word means a hot wind from the Sahara Desert, symbolic of the studio's intent to introduce fresh, new winds into the animation industry. Miyazaki, who has a profound fascination with aviation, specifically named the studio after the Italian Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli aircraft. This historical aircraft also carried the Italian pronunciation, solidifying the hard ""G"" sound.However, when adopting this Italian word into Japanese, the pronunciation shifted due to phonetic constraints in the Japanese language. In Japanese, the studio name is written as ジブリ (Jiburi), explicitly using a soft ""G"" sound, similar to the English ""J."" This was a practical choice, influenced by Japanese linguistic rules and phonetic patterns that do not neatly accommodate certain foreign pronunciations. As a result, within Japan, the official and widely accepted pronunciation became ""Jibli.""Internationally, especially in English-speaking countries, both pronunciations are commonly heard, creating ongoing debate among fans. While many viewers, particularly those familiar with Italian or the historical reference, confidently pronounce it ""Ghibli"" (hard G), others follow the Japanese pronunciation, ""Jibli."" This dual pronunciation has sparked debates on forums, social media, and fan gatherings, each group strongly advocating their preference.Recently, this debate regained viral attention due to a new ChatGPT feature that generates images in ""Studio Ghibli"" style. Social media became flooded with ""Ghiblified"" portraits and landscapes, prompting even greater interest and confusion about pronunciation. Users exchanged video explanations, memes, and heated comments, propelling the topic into the spotlight once again.Considering the studio's Japanese origins and Miyazaki’s personal pronunciation in interviews, ""Jibli"" (soft G) is technically closer to the official studio pronunciation. Nonetheless, ""Ghibli"" with a hard ""G"" remains linguistically accurate in its original Italian context.Ultimately, both pronunciations hold validity: ""Ghibli"" honors the studio's Italian aviation inspiration, while ""Jibli"" respects its Japanese roots. Whether one chooses ""Ghibli"" or ""Jibli"" often depends on cultural context, linguistic preference, or even personal habit. The beauty of language—and indeed the charm of Studio Ghibli itself—is this diversity and fluidity of interpretation.In the end, regardless of pronunciation, the magic and artistry behind Studio Ghibli's creations speak louder than words, captivating audiences worldwide.","Studio Ghibli, the iconic Japanese animation studio founded by legendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, is beloved worldwide for films like ""Spirited Away,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" Despite its global fame, there remains significant confusion about the correct pronunciation of its name.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
