'Very Demure, Very Mindful' trend going viral

The rise of 'demuremaxxing' and 'demuretsey'

In the ever-evolving landscape of TikTok , a new trend has emerged, blending satire with social commentary: the "" Very Demure , Very Mindful"" trend. This phenomenon, also referred to as "" demuremaxxing ,"" has captivated users with its exaggerated portrayal of modesty and traditional femininity. Here’s a deep dive into what this trend is all about and why it has taken the internet by storm.The 'Very Demure, Very Mindful' trend originated from a viral video by TikTok user Jools Lebron.The video, posted on August 2, 2024, featured Lebron demonstrating her beauty routine while emphasising how ""demure"" she was being in her preparations for work. This video quickly gained traction, amassing over 2.7 million views within just ten days.Lebron’s portrayal of demure involved an exaggerated, hyper-feminine display of modesty, from her meticulous makeup application to the careful arrangement of a long, straight wig with a braid. The video was a clear satire, poking fun at the recent rise of trends like the ""tradwife"" movement and the ""clean girl"" aesthetic, both of which advocate for traditional gender roles and appearances.The term 'demure,' according to Merriam-Webster, means ""affectedly modest, reserved, or serious,"" with an added connotation of coyness in certain contexts. In the context of this TikTok trend, 'demure' is used to describe an overly modest and reserved demeanour, exaggerated to the point of absurdity. This deliberate overstatement is what gives the trend its satirical edge, turning the concept of demureness into a meme.The phrase ""Very Demure, Very Mindful"" quickly became a catchphrase on TikTok, as users began to mimic Lebron’s style, incorporating it into various contexts far removed from the original. This led to the creation of content where users acted demure in unlikely situations, such as eating a sandwich or navigating an airport, further amplifying the satirical nature of the trend.The trend’s reach expanded significantly when Bob the Drag Queen, a winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race, joined in. Bob used the sound from Lebron’s video in a TikTok where he applied makeup while lip-syncing the phrase ""very demure, very mindful."" This video alone garnered over 1.2 million views in a single day, bringing even more attention to the trend.As the trend gained popularity, new terms began to emerge. 'Demuremaxxing' refers to taking the demure aesthetic to an extreme, embodying the satirical nature of the trend by amplifying every aspect of traditional femininity and modesty. Another term, 'demuretsey,' combines 'demure' with 'cutesy' to describe a playful, yet equally exaggerated, form of modesty.On August 10, 2024, Lebron released another video explaining the concept of 'demuretsey,' which also went viral, attracting 1.8 million views. These terms have since been adopted by TikTok users who continue to create content that explores and exaggerates these themes.","The 'Very Demure, Very Mindful' trend originated from a viral video by TikTok user Jools Lebron.

'Thank you for ...': What Kamala Harris said about Meghan Markle as rumors swirl of Duchess' possible 2024 endorsement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/us-elections-kamala-harris-said-about-meghan-markle-as-rumors-swirl-of-duchess-possible-2024-endorsement/articleshow/112586327.cms,"Recent revelations about the surprising connection between Vice President Kamala Harris and Meghan Markle has come to light, suggesting that the Duchess of Sussex might soon back Harris in the 2024 race.This speculation comes at a time when Harris is rallying high-profile celebrity support , joining forces with notable figures like George Clooney, Beyoncé, and Kesha.The buzz around Markle’s potential endorsement has heightened interest in the dynamic between these two influential women.Harris has expressed admiration for Markle in the past, though their paths never crossed during her vice presidency.As per Newsweek, two significant interactions were highlighted: In October 2019, Harris retweeted a video of Markle discussing the challenges of media scrutiny during her first pregnancy. Markle had shared, ""Any woman, especially when they're pregnant, you're really vulnerable. Also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm okay."" Harris responded with, ""This is incredibly important. We must remember that it’s a sign of strength to show emotion. Meghan, we are with you.""Further, in June 2020, Harris praised Markle’s virtual commencement address, where Markle tackled the pressing issues of racial injustice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Markle’s assertion, ""I realized the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing,"" struck a chord with Harris. The then-Senator tweeted, ""Thank you, Meghan, for this powerful statement.""Daily Express royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams speculates that Markle’s endorsement could be imminent and might even serve as a launchpad for her ownpolitical ambitions . ""Markle’s support could not only bolster Harris’s campaign but also set the stage for Markle’s future in politics,"" Fitzwilliams was quoted as saying.Since stepping back from her royal duties in January 2020, Markle, alongside Prince Harry, has been increasingly active in US political discourse, advocating for various causes and warning against AI-generated misinformation.With the passing of Senator Dianne Feinstein in September 2023, Markle reportedly has even flirted with the idea of running for Feinstein’s vacant seat, adding another layer to her burgeoning political profile.As Harris’s campaign continues to gain momentum, the potential endorsement from Markle could offer a significant boost. Whether this alliance will transform into tangible political support remains to be seen, but it’s clear that the intersection of Harris and Markle’s paths is generating considerable excitement on both sides of the Atlantic.","Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed admiration for Meghan Markle in the past.

The Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton , reportedly reached out to Meghan Markle , Duchess of Sussex, in an attempt to ease tensions following explosive allegations of racism within the British royal family.The move came after Meghan’s public claims during an interview with Oprah Winfrey, where she mentioned an unnamed royal had expressed “concerns” about the potential skin colour of her unborn child, Prince Archie.This revelation deepened the rift within the royal family, causing significant controversy. The situation escalated further in late 2023 when royal author Omid Scobie , in his book, allegedly implicated King Charles III and the Princess of Wales as part of the ongoing controversy. Although Scobie later clarified that the inclusion of their names was due to an error in an early version of the book, the damage had already been done.In the wake of these events, an insider toldthat Kate Middleton reached out to Meghan Markle to “clear the air.” The phone call, reportedly made at the request of King Charles III, was an attempt to calm the growing tensions within the family. ""Shortly after the book’s allegations came out, Kate reached out to Meghan to clear the air,"" the insider revealed, adding that King Charles was eager to heal the rift to prevent it from overshadowing his reign and the monarchy.The insider also noted that Kate agreed to make the call despite Prince William’s reluctance. ""Charles forced Kate to become his peacemaker after William's refusal,"" the source said, emphasising that Kate has always taken her royal duties seriously and does what is expected of her.The controversy was reignited after Omid Scobie’swas published. Although Scobie later retracted the names from subsequent editions, the initial publication caused a significant uproar.The Dutch publisher, Xander Uitgevers, acknowledged an ""error"" in the text, stating that the names of Charles and Kate were mistakenly included in the early version of the book. However, translator Saskia Peters, who worked on the Dutch edition, toldthat she simply translated the manuscript provided to her and did not add any names herself.The situation remains a delicate issue for the British royal family, with efforts ongoing to resolve the tensions and move forward.","Kate Middleton reportedly reached out to Meghan Markle to “clear the air” The phone call was reportedly made at the request of King Charles III.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

Upgraded cameras with the new 'Add me' AI feature for photos

Google has launched its second-generation Pixel foldable phone, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , which is its first-ever foldable phone in India. The second-gen Pixel Fold upgrades on some salient aspects over the first one. Per Google, the foldable is slim, super durable, and has a brighter screen, both on the outside and inside. And, the phone also packs in Pixel’s “fastest, most powerful” Tensor G4 chip , bringing on-device multimodal capabilities to the phone.On the inside, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold comes equipped with an 8 inches ‘Super Actua Flex display,’ an LTPO panel with a 2922x1344 resolution at 486 PPI. The inner screen has a dynamic refresh rate of 1-120Hz and can go as bright as 3,000 nits, which Google says is 80% brighter than the screen on the first-gen Pixel Fold. To make use of phone’s large inner canvas, there’s a split-screen mode that’ll let you use two apps side-by-side.When unfolded, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can be used a regular phone with a 6.3 inches outer screen, which has the same specs as the inner screen.Google says that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has an “all-new” hinge that is made from stainless steel and has an aerospace grade aluminium alloy cover. The hinge has a polished finish, while the back has the silky matt finish. The phone is rated IPX8 for water resistivity. And there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside.Powering the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s Tensor G4 chip, also found on the other three Pixel 9 phones. The chip comes paired with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB storage. Then, there’s theTitan M2 security coprocessor , which enables multi-layer hardware security.There’s a 5,060mAh battery, which Google promises will last for over 24 hours and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver.

The phone also supports Qi wireless charging and Battery Share, i.e., reverse wireless charging.Out-of-the-box the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will come with Android 14 .

For starters Gemini is there, and it works in split-screen mode, as well. One could ask Gemini to write stuff or even get info about whats’s on the screen or photos. Circle To Search is also there, ohh and this feature can help you check if an image has been created using AI.The new “Pixel-exclusive” AI feature to arrive is Pixel Screenshots. The feature could organise or recall things, like events and location, all you need to is ask the phone.Google is giving one year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free to those who’ll buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. So, that’ll give you access to Gemini Advanced, Gemini in Gmail and Docs, on top of 2TB of cloud storage.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold ditches the camera visor for a squircle module that houses a triple lens setup – a 50MP wide camera, a 48MP ultraide and a 48MP 5x telephoto camera. For selfies, there's a 42 MP front-facing camera on the inner screen and 10MP camera on the outside.The camera hardware has been only a part of Pixel’s camera, but it’s AI that completes it.

Social media outrage on Sarah Sarosh's GRWM video

Sarah Sarosh’s apology

In the age of social media, influencers wield significant power to shape public opinion. And with this power they also have responsibility not only to the brands they promote but also to their followers', many of whom may trust them blindly. It appears that Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, forgot this very responsibility.In what can be called a repulsive post, Sarah Sarosh posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.In one-minute-four-second video, which has now been deleted, she is promoting makeup products that she seemingly is endorsing, while a commentary on the brutal rape and murder case runs in the background. The video, criticised for being insensitive and out-of-touch, sparked widespread outrage across various social media platforms. Despite issuing an apology, the incident has ignited a broader conversation about the appropriateness of using certain social media formats to discuss such grave issues.The video in question was part of a ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) series, a popular format where influencers apply makeup while engaging in conversation. In this particular video , Sarah Sarosh appeared cheerful and upbeat as she applied serums, face creams, and makeup, all while a voiceover narrated the harrowing details of a recent crime in Kolkata. The stark contrast between the lighthearted makeup tutorial and the grave subject matter led to an immediate backlash.The video has left users across platforms like Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram shocked at her insensitivity. One Reddit user commented, “This is so distasteful and insensitive. She will do anything for views,” reflecting a common sentiment that the video was made purely for attention, without regard for the gravity of the topic.Another user questioned the decision to pair such serious content with a GRWM format, saying, “At this point, these people’s accounts should be banned. If she really had to talk about this topic, she could’ve sat down rather than doing a GRWM. How are the audio and video related?”On X, one of the users labelled the video “Absolutely disgusting,” while another user lamented the lengths some influencers will go for likes, stating, “Looks like there’s no end to how low they can go for likes. Nothing is off limits. No basic human decency is required.”In response to the backlash, Sarah Sarosh took to Instagram Stories to issue a public apology. She explained that her intent had been to raise awareness about the crime while also addressing her beauty content, which she had already filmed months earlier. “I posted a GRWM reel yesterday which was shot 2 months ago with a voiceover on the current affairs of the rape & murder incident,” she wrote. Sarosh admitted that she did not realise how “tone deaf” the video would appear, acknowledging that the mismatch between the content of the video and the subject of the voiceover was a grave error.Sarosh also shared her immediate reaction upon receiving negative comments, revealing that she deleted the video within five minutes of posting it. “The comments made me realise instantly that the messaging is distasteful from my end,” she said. “I deeply apologise for my actions to all those who have come across the content through screen recordings of my deleted content being circulated on other platforms.”","Sarah Sarosh, a fashion influencer with over 200K followers, posted a video on the heinous Kolkata murder-rape case where she can be seen smiling and applying make-up.

California man credits Apple Watch for saving his life: ‘I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/california-man-credits-apple-watch-for-saving-his-life-i-wouldnt-be-here-if-it-wasnt-for-this-little-device/articleshow/112306053.cms,"Apple Watch detects user’s low heart rate



What doctor said

An Apple Watch user is crediting the smartwatch for saving his life after the wearable alerted him about a life-threatening condition. Peter Moore , a resident of Montecito, California shared his experience with a local news publisher KTLA. Narrating the incident, he said “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this little device”.Moore, who is a former tech executive, said that he was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint”.“Like a typical male, I thought, ‘I’ll go to Starbucks. That’ll fix it,'” Moore explained before he received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing.“My phone started to ping and said ‘low heart rate,’ which I’d never seen before. And so I looked at it… my heart rate had dropped to 32. And it was insistent in its notifications that something wasn’t right,” said Moore. He then contacted his wife who took him to hospital.“The doctor kind of theatrically ran in and said, ‘This is not good. This is not good. You need a pacemaker right now,'” Moore said.Omid Yousefian, the cardiac electrophysiologist at Sansum Clinic Cardiology who treated Moore said “Yes, his watch had a big role in saving his life”.“These days, 25% of the population over the age of 40 … have a high chance of experiencing atrial fibrillation,” Yousefian explained.“For us physicians, symptoms are the most important thing. [Moore] was notified by his watch that his heart rate is slow and he correlated that with the symptoms that he had. So he didn’t wait. He didn’t sit. He came to the hospital directly. So he made a very smart move,” Yousefian told the publication.","Peter Moore, a former tech executive, was on his way to the airport when he began to feel “a little lightheaded and a little faint” He received a notification from the Apple Watch he was wearing that his heart rate had dropped to 32.

"iPhone 15 exchange scam on Amazon: Supreme Court lawyer shares how he was 'duped', and what buyers should not do",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-15-exchange-scam-on-amazon-supreme-court-lawyer-shares-how-he-was-duped-and-what-buyers-should-not-do/articleshow/112307116.cms,"

What exactly happened

Read the complete post here

In a shocking incident, a Supreme Court lawyer, Mukul P Unny , was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon .in. The lawyer detailed his ordeal on social media, highlighting the fraudulent tactics employed by the delivery executive.Unny took X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the new kind of smartphone exchange scam.The incident occurred on July 21, 2024, when Unny placed an order for the iPhone 15 on Amazon. The following day, a delivery executive arrived at his residence and handed over the new phone after receiving the necessary OTP. However, the executive then requested another OTP, claiming it was required to complete the exchange.Despite Unny's hesitation, he was convinced to return the new iPhone to the delivery executive after speaking to the latter's supervisor.Unny contacted Amazon customer care the following day to report the incident. Initially, Amazon assured him of a refund if the product was not delivered. However, subsequent inquiries revealed the case was under investigation with a resolution deadline of July 31.On July 31st, Amazon concluded its investigation and informed Unny that a refund was impossible. The company's explanation lacked substance, as they had not thoroughly verified the scam details. The fact that Unny still possessed his old iPhone directly contradicted Amazon's claim that the exchange was complete.While Amazon has eventually issued a refund to Unny, his ordeal underscores the considerable risks inherent in online transactions, even when dealing with reputable platforms like Amazon.Always verify the identity of a delivery executive before sharing your Amazon OTP. This crucial step can protect you from falling victim to scams.“This is the story of my worst experience with @amazonIN On 21.07.2024, I ordered iPhone 15 from Amazon in exchange for my iPhone 13. On 22.07.2024, the delivery executive came at around 930 PM. I gave the OTP and took the product, and gave my phone to the executive.He said I have give another OTP. I had already given the OTP and was wondering what other OTP is to be given for exchange. I said I dont have any other OTP than the one I have given. He stayed there for few minutes & then called his supervisor.After speaking with the supervisor, the delivery exec asked for return of the product since the ""exchange is not final"".I insisted that I speak with the supervisor. The supervisor tells me that the exchange is done by a different team & requests for the product to be returned. I said I cannot give away the product especially since the OTP is given and the app was showing that the product is delivered. But this supervisor Ashok (8076650306) requested me to return, lest his team will have to make for the loss.Upon his request and assurance that the product will be ""reattempted"" the next day, I gave the product to the delivery exec (Vishal 8826421956) after taking the supervisor's and the delivery exec's number. On 23.07.2024, I spoke with the Amazon Customer Care and raised a complaint to which I assured that refund will be initiated if the product is not delivered. Call centre asked me to follow up on 25.07.2024.On 26.07.2024,when I called them, the customer case asked me to wait till 31.05.2024 as ""it has to be investigated"". Today, when I call Amazon, they said ""investigation"" is complete and that refund cannot be initiated. No fact-finding was done by Amazon in this. Now, we are staring at a loss of Rs. 38000 and a possible scam done by supervisor, delivery exec and others at Amazon. If they say that the exchange is done, then they can very well see the old phone that I still use with me.This could happen to any one of you and please be aware while dealing with @amazonIN.”","Supreme Court lawyer Mukul P Unny was scammed out of Rs 38,000 while attempting to exchange his iPhone 13 for an iPhone 15 on Amazon.in.

Even though the WWE is home to a truckload of drama and bone-breaking rivalries, many of the stars are actually closer than you might imagine outside of the ring.

Over the years, their friendship has only grown stronger as both men frequently compliment one another in interviews and offer support during significant life events.Although they have one of the fiercest rivalries in recent WWE history, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair are good friends off-screen.

The American Nightmare’s Return to Wrestling

Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes have an intense moment #summerslam

""Everyone keeps asking me how I feel about coming back to WWE, if I'm really excited. The response I keep giving is that it’s just a really heavy feeling. I grew up in the WWE system with the dream of reaching the top. But as Garth Brooks sings, 'dreams are like rivers,' and mine took a different path. Now, to have the opportunity to revisit that original goal when I thought it was out of reach is just a profound, heavy experience.""

Throughout his career,has been known for adopting various nicknames, especially during his two different tenures in WWE. Early on, Rhodes was recognized as ""Dashing"" Cody Rhodes, a persona that highlighted his good looks and confidence. But after getting a facial injury that necessitated the use of a mask, he changed his identity to become ""Undashing"" Cody Rhodes, adopting a more sinister and troubled persona.The most notable and influential moniker Rhodes has worn, though, especially throughout his prosperous tenures in AEW and WWE, where he now holds the title of Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, is ""."" This is a witty reinterpretation of his father Dusty Rhodes ' well-known namesake, ""The American Dream.""Rhodes discussed the history of the moniker """" in an interview with GQ Sports, providing insight into how it came to be. The moniker, according to Rhodes, was given to him when he was a member of the notorious Bullet Club while he was still with New Japan Pro Wrestling.Rhodes said.Interestingly, Rhodes didn't mention that the ""American Nightmare"" persona wasn’t entirely original within his family. Before Cody, his older brother Dustin Rhodes had already used the moniker. Dustin adopted the ""American Nightmare"" name upon his return to WCW in 1999, after initially coming back under the gimmick ""Seven,"" which he quickly dropped. As ""The American Nightmare,"" Dustin feuded with notable wrestlers like Jeff Jarrett and Terry Funk before eventually disappearing from television. When he returned in 2001, Dustin decided to leave the ""American Nightmare"" nickname behind. Cody Rhodes has since taken the nickname to new heights, making it his own and solidifying it as an integral part of his wrestling identity.With a lot of buzz surrounding his next move, professional wrestler Cody Rhodes emerged as the most sought-after free agent in 2022. Even with all of the talk about where he would end up, a lot of indications suggested he will return to WWE, the organisation where he initially gained notoriety.In April, Rhodes made his eagerly awaited comeback at WrestleMania 38, entering the arena as Seth Rollins ' unexpected rival. The stadium erupted in cheers as Rhodes prevailed in a match that would live in memory. Reflecting on his return, Rhodes shared with Variety,","Cody Rhodes has been known for adopting various nicknames, especially during his two different tenures in WWE.
