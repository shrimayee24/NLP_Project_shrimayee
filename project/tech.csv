One more thing?

Apple’s next big event of the year, “It’s Glowtime” is scheduled for September 9, and if the tradition is kept alive, it’s where the company will announce the newest batch of iPhones – four of them, at least this year and a lot more. The invite has a glowing Apple, which seems to be a nudge to the new Siri coming to iPhones, and obviously AI, aka Apple Intelligence.It’s going to be a packed event. So, here’s everything we expect Apple to reveal on September 9 at “It’s Glowtime” event.Apple's "" It's Glowtime "" event is set for today, i.e., Monday, September 9, at 10:30 PM IST (10:00 AM PDT). The event will be live streamed on Apple.com, Apple TV app, and company YouTube channel.You can also tune in at www. timesofindia.com/technology for live updates throughout the event.Like the last few years, the iPhone 16 series is expected to have a total of four models - iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max.The vanilla models – iPhone 16 and 16 Plus – are expected to be minor upgrades, featuring a new pill-shaped camera island and an Action Button replacing the Silent Switch. They'll likely retain the same screen sizes and 60Hz refresh rate. The A18 Bionic chip will enable AI capabilities, and RAM might increase to 8GB. Camera specs are expected to remain unchanged, with pricing starting at $799 for the iPhone 16 and $899 for the 16 Plus.iPhone 16 Pro models are rumoured to have larger screens: 6.3 inches for the Pro and 6.9 inches for the Pro Max. They'll feature a new Capture Button for camera functions and retain the titanium body, possibly introducing new pink and brown colour options. The Pro models will house the A18 Pro chip and may be manufactured in India for the first time.While the vanilla models are expected to have the same set of cameras – 48MP + 12MP – as the previous generation, the Pro models are in for an upgrade. The iPhone 16 Pro could get the same 5x tetraprism telephoto lens as the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Rumours are also rife that the iPhone 16 Pro models would upgrade to a 48MP ultrawide sensor, up from 12MP. The main 48MP sensor is expected to remain unchanged. Pricing for the Pro models is anticipated to start at $1,099 for the 16 Pro and $1,199 for the 16 Pro Max.Overall, the vanilla iPhone 16 models offer modest improvements, while the Pro versions bring more substantial upgrades in screen size, camera capabilities, and possibly colour options. Both lines will feature new chips enabling AI functionalities, with pricing expected to remain similar to the previous generation.The new Apple Watch Series X – or possibly Series 10 – could shape up to be the biggest update in recent years. It’s rumoured to come in larger sizes – a 45mm one (this will probably replace the 41mm model) and a second 49mm like the Ultra model. The second change would be a thinner overall design. While earlier rumours had been describing the new design as flat, similar to that of Apple Watch Ultra, recent rumours suggest otherwise.Furthermore, the Watch Series X might come with a redesigned band attachment system, which, according to sources, should make attaching and detaching the bands much easier. But this would also make existing bands incompatible.The Series X is said to have a larger battery to complement the increased size. There's also speculation about improved water resistance ratings, though this might be reserved for an updated Ultra model.The Series X is likely to pack a new, more powerful S10 SiP, and will run watchOS 11.Rumours are that the Watch Series X could come improved new health sensors. The most significant functional addition is expected to be sleep apnea detection, building on existing sleep tracking features to identify potential breathing issues during rest. However, don't expect to see the long-rumoured blood pressure or glucose monitoring just yet, as those technologies are reportedly still in development.While the exterior changes might grab headlines, the Series X could also bring some less visible but impactful upgrades.As with recent iPhone releases, the Series X will likely focus on refining the Apple Watch experience rather than introducing revolutionary new features.The Apple Watch Ultra 3 isn't expected to be a radical departure from its rugged predecessor. It'll likely maintain the same titanium case and expansive display, with improvements focused on internal upgrades. The most significant change could be a new, more efficient chip, potentially offering extended battery life beyond the current 36-hour rating. Rumours also suggest enhanced GPS accuracy and possibly new sensors tailored for extreme sports enthusiasts, though details remain scarce.As for the Apple Watch SE 3, the budget-friendly model might see its most significant overhaul yet. The most notable rumoured change is a shift from an aluminium case to a rigid plastic shell, potentially bringing the price point even lower to compete with entry-level offerings from rivals. While it's likely to retain the essential health and fitness tracking features of its predecessor, don't expect additions like ECG or blood oxygen monitoring.There could be not one but two AirPods this year. No, we are not talking about the AirPods and AirPods Pro. But two models of the AirPods 4 – potentially a ‘SE’ model.The AirPods 4 would largely maintain the familiar stem design, but these could have a slightly tweaked earbud shape for improved comfort. Then, the AirPods 4 are said to switch to USB-C charging cases across the board. One variant is expected to gain a speaker in its charging case, enhancing its compatibility with Apple's Find My network for easier location when misplaced.While audio quality improvements are anticipated, don't expect a massive leap, although the pricier model might come with active noise cancellation. Although the AirPods 4 are expected to gain some new features, like ANC and Find My, they still might not get the audio capabilities of the Pro mode.Apple might finally give the AirPods Max their due update, but it won’t be a major one. The second generation of AirPods Max is rumoured to be an iterative one. The most significant and only change is rumoured to be the long-awaited switch to USB-C charging. The upcoming iteration of AirPods Max could come with a newer H2 chip, but rumours have not said so. Rumours point towards a possible expansion of the colour palette.Apple is expected to give out the dates for rollout of the next-generation of software updates. If rumours are to be believed, the iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 10, and tvOS 17 all slated to later this month.Alongside all the rumoured unveilings, the September 9 event might have an unexpected ""one more thing"" moment, though it's not typical for this showcase.Rumours are swirling about a dramatically redesigned Mac Mini, potentially Apple's smallest desktop computer yet. It's said to be roughly the size of an Apple TV box, ditching USB-A ports for a sleeker profile. Two versions are reportedly in the works – one with the standard M4 chip and another sporting the beefier M4 Pro. While the base model is rumoured to be shipping from suppliers this month, its appearance at the iPhone event isn't guaranteed.Apple could easily save this compact powerhouse for a dedicated Mac event later in the year, similar to last fall's colourful iMac M3 reveal. Don't hold your breath for an iPad Mini refresh either – despite being due for an update, Apple typically reserves iPad announcements for separate occasions.","Apple's next big event of the year, “It’s Glowtime” is scheduled for September 9.

Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla Motors and visionary entrepreneur, has once again made headlines by launching the beta version of X TV , a new feature within the X app (formerly known as Twitter). This innovative addition is set to transform the way users consume films, live content, and recorded shows, all within the X ecosystem. By reducing reliance on external media platforms, Musk aims to consolidate entertainment and social interaction into a single space, enhancing user experience and keeping them engaged for longer periods.The beta release of X TV, unveiled on September 3, 2024, is currently available to a select group of users, whose feedback will be critical in shaping the platform’s future updates.On September 3, 2024, Musk took to his X account to announce the beta release of X TV:Although not yet available to the general public, the beta version is being tested by early adopters who are actively exploring its functionalities. The app is currently optimised for Android TVs but will soon be integrated with LG, Amazon Fire TV, and Google TV. Musk’s team has hinted at more platform expansions in the future, allowing a wider range of users to experience X TV.The beta phase is essential for collecting user feedback and making improvements before a full-scale launch. Musk has a history of leveraging user insights to fine-tune new features, and X TV is expected to follow this same iterative development model.X TV boasts several innovative features that set it apart from traditional streaming platforms. These features are designed to provide flexibility, control, and an enhanced user experience.One of the standout features is Replay TV, which allows users to store up to 72 hours of shows in the cloud. This feature ensures that users never miss a favourite program, even if they are unable to watch it live. Replay TV provides the freedom to catch up on missed content at any time within the 72-hour window, making it perfect for today’s on-the-go lifestyle.For those who tune in late to a live broadcast, Startover TV offers a game-changing solution. This feature enables viewers to restart any live show from the very beginning, ensuring they don’t miss crucial moments. Whether it's a live sporting event, a news broadcast, or a favourite TV show, Startover TV ensures that viewers can enjoy the full experience, regardless of when they begin watching.One of the most user-friendly features is Free Cloud DVR, which allows users to record up to 100 hours of content at no extra cost. This feature is particularly appealing to those who wish to store a wide range of content, from movies to series, without worrying about additional fees. By offering this feature for free, X TV positions itself as a cost-effective alternative to other streaming services that charge for cloud storage.The launch of X TV represents a significant step in Musk’s vision to turn X from a simple microblogging platform into a comprehensive multimedia hub. While the X app has long been known for its ability to disseminate real-time information and updates, the addition of X TV seeks to broaden its appeal by incorporating a variety of media experiences within the same platform.This integration is not just about expanding content options; it’s about increasing user engagement. By offering movies, live broadcasts, and recorded content, X TV gives users more reasons to stay on the platform, thus reducing the need to switch between multiple apps or services.X TV is also expected to encourage content creators, influencers, and media companies to engage with the X app more fully. The potential for live-streamed events, interactive programming, and user-generated content creates new avenues for growth and user interaction.As the X TV beta continues to roll out, additional features and platform integrations are expected in the near future. These updates may include broader compatibility with Apple TV, Roku, and other streaming devices, further increasing the app’s reach. Musk has also hinted at potential partnerships with media companies, which could lead to exclusive content being available on X TV.Furthermore, there is speculation about possible AI-driven content recommendations that would help personalise the user experience. Given Musk’s interest in AI and its integration across his companies, such a feature could be a logical next step for X TV.Another area to watch is social viewing, where users could watch content together with friends, share reactions in real-time, and discuss events as they unfold. Such features would help X TV maintain its social roots while expanding its media capabilities.","X TV is a new feature within the X app (formerly known as Twitter) It is set to transform the way users consume films, live content, and recorded shows.

New Gen-Z trend? The viral 'airport tray aesthetic' is turning heads. What is it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-gen-z-trend-the-viral-airport-tray-aesthetic-is-turning-heads-what-is-it/articleshow/113172250.cms,"What is it about?

How did it start?

A new trend is sweeping through social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram , where Gen Z travelers arrange personal items in airport security trays for perfectly staged photos. Dubbed the "" airport tray aesthetic ,"" this viral phenomenon sees passengers transforming an everyday airport routine into a creative visual showcase. While some enjoy the artistry, others worry about the potential delays it could cause at security checkpoints.The trend, which involves carefully organizing sunglasses, shoes, books, and other personal items, has sparked a mix of admiration and frustration.Some travelers are all for the aesthetic appeal, while others question whether it’s worth the hassle, especially in busy airports.The ""airport tray aesthetic"" involves travelers using their time at airport security to arrange belongings in an appealing way and then snapping photos to share online. Commonly featured are neatly positioned designer shoes, vintage sunglasses, and even film cameras, turning a typically mundane part of travel into an 'Instagrammable' moment.According to CNN, brands like Anthropologie and storage solutions company Stackers have tapped into this trend, using it to promote travel-friendly products. Stackers noted that the trend “aligned perfectly” with their aesthetic focus on curated travel accessories.The trend gained significant attention after New York-based influencer Chelsea Henriquez shared a video on TikTok, advising followers to wait until after security to arrange their trays to avoid holding up the line. Henriquez told the New York Post that this approach allows her to set up her tray near the benches without rushing or inconveniencing other travelers. Her video, which has since accumulated over 377,000 views, helped propel the trend into the spotlight.Not all participants are actually in airports, though. Influencers like Alyssa Lenore have admitted to purchasing TSA-style bins to recreate the setup at home, where they stage and photograph their belongings without the pressure of an actual security line. Lenore told NYP, “I don’t want to be in a position with people — especially on a line [where] intensities are already high” .While some travelers appreciate the creativity, others see it as a potential time-waster. The New York Post described the trend as “time-consuming” and a possible source of delays in already long TSA lines. Many worry that the extra minutes influencers spend setting up trays could slow down security lines, especially at busy airports like JFK, where travelers can already face delays of 25 minutes or more.Commenters on TikTok echoed these frustrations, with one person writing, ""No, I’d be so mad if I was stuck behind you"" .However, the TSA has addressed these concerns, stating that as long as the staged photos don’t disrupt security operations or other travelers, they aren’t an issue. Travelers are reminded to keep important documents like passports and IDs secure.Despite the criticisms, many participants argue that the trend is more about creative expression than causing delays. Influencer Piper Taich explained, “It’s a really fun way to express my love of fashion and artistic direction,” in one of her TikTok videos.","The ""airport tray aesthetic"" involves travelers arranging belongings in an appealing way and then snapping photos to share online.

iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus: A familiar but different design, upgraded chip, and more to expect

iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max: Bigger screens, upgraded cameras, and one more button expected

Image credit: Sonny Dickson on X (formerly Twitter)

Apple's big reveal of the year – the new iPhones – is on September 9. The Cupertino giant is highly expected to unveil the new iPhone 16 series at the “It’s Glowtime” event. The iPhone 16 series, having vanilla and Pro variants, will have a total of four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max . Here’s all we know and you need to know about the upcoming iPhone 16 series.The new vanilla iPhones – the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus – aren’t expected to be a major upgrade over last year’s model. They’ll largely look the same, except for two differences – the first and most noticeable would be the new rumoured camera island, which is said to be pill-shaped like the one we saw on iPhone X, and the other change would be the Action Button replacing Silent Switch. Rumours also point towards a new Capture Button on the vanilla models, but some claim that it’ll be reserved for Pro models.The sizes are expected to remain the same – iPhone 16 having a 6.1-inch screen and iPhone 16 Plus measuring in at 6.8 inches. And this year, also iPhone 16 models are expected to have a 60Hz refresh rate.Rumours say that the vanilla iPhone 16 models would come in a more saturated colourway compared to the iPhone 15 models.Inside, the vanilla iPhone 16 models are said to come with an upgraded chip, likely to be named A18 Bionic. The chip will enable the AI capabilities on the iPhone 16 models, so we expect it to be of a similar level to last year’s iPhone 15 Pro A17 Pro chip. Rumours suggests that Apple might also bump up the RAM on vanilla models from 6GB to 8GB. Storage options are expected to remain the same as iPhone 15 models – 128GB, 256GB and 512GB.While the camera module would have a new design, the camera sensors are expected to remain the same – a 48MP main and a 12MP ultrawide unit. On the front, the iPhone 16 might come with the same 12MP sensor as the last year’s iPhone 15 models.That’s it for the vanilla iPhone models. Pricing is expected to remain the same, at least in the US. With iPhone 16 rumoured to start at $799 (Rs 79,990 in India), and iPhone 16 Plus is rumoured to have starting price of $899 (Rs 89,990 in India), same as the iPhone 15 models.While the Pro models this year are not expected to go through a major overhaul, they still might come with some considerable changes. First up is the size. The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to have bigger screens than before. Rumours are rife that the iPhone 16 Pro will have a 6.3-inch screen, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max might come with a 6.9-inch screen, up from 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively.However, they might feel much bigger than last year’s models since the size increase is said to be because of the border reduction structure, rather than Apple physically using larger screens. These will still be 120Hz ProMotion screens, although the new models might have some more brightness.Another change to expect is a new Capture Button, which as the name implies would basically be for capturing pictures, and even videos. It could open camera, zoom in or zoom out and do even more tasks in the camera app. It’ll open the camera, zoom in or out, or even do some more inside the app.Like the iPhone 15 Pro models, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to have a titanium body. This year, the Pro models could get a new colour. Rumours point towards a new pink and brown shade of titanium. As of now, multiple iterations of the said brown model have been leaked online – some paint it dark brown while some show it in a light brown shade. So, we might have to wait until September 9 to see what shade of brown Apple eventually went with.The new Pro models will come with a new Pro chip, which if we were to guess could be dubbed A18 Pro .As for the cameras, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are said to match up their setups. The iPhone 16 Pro could get an upgrade, having the 5x tetraprism telephoto lens, same as the iPhone 16 Pro Max. While main camera will remain the same 48MP sensor, the ultrawide could get upgraded from a 12MP sensor to a larger 48MP sensor, promising significant quality improvement.Reports say that the iPhone 16 Pro models will be manufactured locally in India, a first for Apple. So, we could expect the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max to be priced same as the iPhone 15 Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro could start at $1,099 (Rs 1,29,900 in India), and iPhone 15 Pro Max might have starting price of $1,199 (Rs 1,39,900 in India).","Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone 16 series on September 9. vanilla and Pro variants will have a total of four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16 Pro.

Nile crocodiles: A fearsome species

Cassius: The largest crocodile

A massive 16-foot, 700 kg Nile crocodile named Henry , has been officially recognised as the world's oldest crocodile at 123 years old. The crocodile has fathered over 10,000 offspring with his six mates, according to the zoo where he inhabits.Henry, known for his big size and fearsome fangs, is nearly equivalent to that of a minibus. He was born on December 16, 1900, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana , a Unesco World Heritage Site .In the early 1900s, Henry was believed to have preyed on children from a local Botswana tribe. Frustrated with his deadly behavior, the tribe sought the help of renowned hunter Sir Henry Neumann in 1903. Instead of killing Henry, Neumann opted to capture him, sentencing the crocodile to a lifetime in captivity.Henry has spent the last thirty years at the Crocworld Conservation Centre in Scottburgh, South Africa. He is admired from a safe distance at the conservation centre, far removed from his violent past.Nile crocodiles, found across 26 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are known for their aggressive nature. These apex predators inhabit various aquatic environments, including lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshes. Known for their brutality, Nile crocodiles often prey on animals such as zebras and porcupines.

Muted microphones to ensure civility

Speaking format and debate structure

Strict rules on props and interaction

High stakes in a close race

In what is shaping up to be a historic and highly anticipated showdown, US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night. The event marks the first time the two will directly face off as they vie for the presidency in what has become a closely contested race.The debate, which will be hosted by ABC, follows weeks of heated negotiations between the two campaigns regarding the format, rules , and logistics.As the campaigns sharpen their strategies, voters are eager to witness the direct exchange of ideas and positions between two of the country’s most prominent political figures.The debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a fitting location given its historical significance in American democracy. The 90-minute event is scheduled to start at 9:00 pm local time on Tuesday (6.30 IST Wednesday), and it will be aired live across major networks. Unlike previous debates, this one will take place without an audience in the room, an effort to minimize distractions and ensure the focus remains solely on the candidates.Moderating the debate will be ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, both seasoned journalists known for their sharp questioning and ability to handle tense moments. The debate will feature two commercial breaks, offering brief pauses during what promises to be a charged exchange.One of the most hotly debated topics leading up to the event was whether microphones would be muted, a feature used in the past to prevent interruptions. This issue reignited tensions between the campaigns, with each side accusing the other of dodging tough questions. Trump’s team argued against mic muting, claiming it stifles free speech, while Harris’s camp pointed to past debates where constant interruptions derailed meaningful discussion.ABC ultimately decided that each candidate’s microphone would be live only during their allotted speaking time. When one candidate is speaking, the other’s mic will be muted, ensuring a smoother exchange. Only the moderators will have the authority to ask questions, and no topics or questions have been shared with the candidates beforehand, further adding to the anticipation surrounding the event.There will be no opening statements from the candidates, a departure from typical debate formats. Instead, the candidates will dive directly into answering questions, with each given two minutes per question to state their position. Following this, their opponent will have two minutes to rebut, creating an opportunity for direct engagement on each topic. An additional minute will be provided for follow-ups, clarifications, or further responses, allowing both Trump and Harris to refine their arguments or counter the other’s claims.At the end of the debate, both candidates will have the chance to deliver two-minute closing statements, with Trump going last due to the result of a virtual coin toss. This structure ensures that each candidate will have ample time to make their case while maintaining the debate’s brisk pace.To maintain a level playing field and avoid theatrics, the debate will follow strict rules regarding props and materials. Both candidates will stand behind podiums for the entire duration of the event, and neither will be allowed to bring props or pre-written notes to the stage. They will be equipped with only a pen, a pad of paper, and a bottle of water. This eliminates any opportunity for one candidate to gain an advantage through visual aids or pre-prepared statements.Additionally, campaign staff will not be permitted to communicate or interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks, reinforcing the expectation that Harris and Trump must rely solely on their own preparation and quick thinking.This debate comes at a critical juncture in the election, as polls show a dead heat between the two candidates. For Trump, the event represents an opportunity to demonstrate his continued appeal to voters and defend his record in office. For Harris, the debate is a chance to solidify her position as a presidential contender and challenge Trump’s policies head-on.With the nation watching, both candidates are expected to come prepared for a fiery exchange. The outcome of the debate could shape the direction of the race in its final weeks, making it a must-watch event for voters on all sides of the political spectrum.","US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will meet in a head-to-head debate on Tuesday night.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn’t see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry’s memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry’s depiction of Kate Middleton’s supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

Cosplay: Fantasy meets reality: Why Chinese women are hiring female cosplayers to play dream men,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/fantasy-meets-reality-why-chinese-women-are-hiring-female-cosplayers-to-play-dream-men/articleshow/113095221.cms,"Bringing dream man to reality



Day out in the city



A new kind of relationship



Raising the bar



Emotional satisfaction in a new era



In the final years of high school, Xu Yunting, a Chinese teenager, stumbled upon an unusual side gig—transforming herself into male video game characters and taking their female fans on dates. What started as a way to make pocket money became part of a burgeoning trend in China, known as "" cos commissioning "".This unique job has taken off in China, with many young women using their purchasing power to transform digital fantasies into real-world experiences.The trend has sparked massive interest online, where social media platforms are buzzing with posts about cos commissioning.The concept? Fans of romance games hire female cosplayers to become their favorite male characters and accompany them on dates, creating a fusion of virtual fantasy and reality.Xu Yunting has perfected the art of embodying male characters from popular romance games. One of her most-requested roles is ""Jesse,"" a sensitive musician from ' Light and Night ,' a mobile game produced by tech giant Tencent that allows players to fall in love with various fictional men.Feng Xinyu, a lively 19-year-old, is one of Xu’s regular clients. For Feng, real-life men—whom she refers to as ""3D men""—don’t hold the same appeal as the perfect, fictional characters she encounters in games.“I’m just not interested in dating real guys,” Feng explains. “Game characters are more idealised and fulfilling to me.”'Light and Night' has become a favorite for young women like Feng. It promises a deeply immersive love experience, allowing players to develop emotional connections with their virtual suitors. Players like Feng, who identify as ""dream girls,"" often form intense emotional attachments to the game’s characters. Cos commissioning takes this to another level, bringing these 2D beaus into the real world.Feng has hired Xu three times now to play Jesse, each time paying roughly $70. However, Feng recently splurged on a much more expensive trip with another Jesse cosplayer, spending $2,800 for a multi-day experience. In the end, though, she decided that Xu captured the essence of Jesse better and returned to her for another date.“She’s just like the character,” Feng said to the AFP team. ""It feels like we were meant to be together.""Feng greeted Xu with delight when they met at the metro station. The two held hands and chatted happily as they embarked on their date, which Feng had meticulously planned and paid for.Starting with a relaxing tea break to an indulging hotpot dinner. Their date also included a doll-painting workshop and a cake-decorating class—activities where they were just one of many cos commission pairs.Businesses have taken notice of the trend. Employees at the cake-decorating class shared that they now regularly see cos commission couples. What began as a niche phenomenon is rapidly becoming mainstream.Experts suggest that cos commissioning isn’t just about fantasy—it’s about control and empowerment. The women paying for these experiences get to design their ideal relationship, free from the uncertainties and frustrations of dating real men. They also feel safer and more understood in these interactions, especially since many of the cosplayers, like Xu, are women themselves.“In these interactions, it doesn’t matter what gender the cosplayer is,” says Tian Qian, a professor at Fudan University. “What matters is that the cosplayer becomes a vessel for the client’s emotions, bringing their fantasy to life.”For many young women, the appeal of these interactions lies in their ability to construct an idealized, heteronormative relationship. Conservative social norms around gender roles still dominate Chinese society, often reinforced by state media and popular culture.Zhou Zixing, another academic, has observed that cos commissioning gives women an opportunity to experience relationships on their own terms, where their desires are prioritized.Xu, who enjoys bringing fictional characters to life, believes the experience of dating game characters can positively influence her clients’ expectations of real-life partners.""The men in these games are high-quality,"" Xu explained. ""By experiencing this kind of relationship, I think women can raise their standards in real life and avoid settling for less.""Xu’s mother, Fang Xiuqing, initially struggled to understand her daughter’s work. ""At first, I couldn’t believe this was something my daughter would do,"" Fang admitted. But over time, she has come to see cos commissioning as a harmless and enjoyable activity that brings joy to others.“It’s a hobby more than a job,” Fang said. “She’s happy doing it, and she makes other people happy too.”As the cos commissioning trend grows, it offers more than just a paid service—it provides emotional satisfaction for those who engage in it. Fudan University’s Tian Qian describes it as “emotional sustenance,” saying that even though the interaction is transactional, it still gives clients a sense of being cared for and seen.In a society where traditional dating norms can feel limiting, cos commissioning offers a creative and controlled way for women to engage in romance. For many, it’s not just about meeting their dream game character—it’s about constructing a relationship that caters to their needs, desires, and fantasies in ways real-world relationships often can’t.As this phenomenon continues to expand, it challenges conventional ideas of love and companionship, offering a glimpse into the evolving ways in which people form connections in the digital age.","'Cos commissioning' is a growing trend in China.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram , has recently become the subject of widespread speculation after older photos of him resurfaced online. These images have led many to wonder whether the billionaire entrepreneur underwent plastic surgery to enhance his appearance. Adding to the intrigue, Durov was recently arrested in France, raising further questions about the man behind the popular messaging app.Pavel Durov, a 39-year-old entrepreneur originally from Russia, is best known as the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.Telegram quickly gained popularity for its strong emphasis on user privacy, offering end-to-end encryption and other security features that set it apart from competitors. As of now, Forbes estimates Durov's net worth to be around $15.5 billion. Despite his success in the tech industry, Durov has managed to maintain a relatively low profile—until now.Durov's recent arrest in Paris has added a new layer of complexity to his public image. He was detained in France on charges of suspected complicity in running an online platform involved in illicit activities, including child exploitation, drug trafficking, and fraud. While these allegations are serious, it is the sudden focus on Durov's physical transformation that has captured the internet's attention.Pavel Durov has been active on social media platforms like Instagram since 2011, regularly sharing photos from his travels around the world. In his recent posts, Durov appears with a full head of hair and a toned physique, often posing shirtless in various locations. However, these recent images stand in stark contrast to older photos where Durov was seen with a noticeably receding hairline.The drastic change in his appearance has fueled rumours that Durov may have undergone plastic surgery, including a possible hair transplant. A popular post on X (formerly Twitter) by a well-known account shared a side-by-side comparison of Durov's old and new photos, sparking a flurry of online discussions. The post reads, ""Pavel Durov (Telegram CEO) before his hair transplant and plastic surgery,"" and has since gone viral.The speculation around Durov's transformation has been met with a variety of opinions online. On Reddit, users have debated whether the changes in Durov's appearance are the result of surgical procedures or simply better grooming and styling.One Reddit user commented, ""This isn't a hair transplant. His hair is too thick and full to have this kind of drastic change from a HT. Most likely he's wearing a hair system (wig).""Another user added, ""There's speculation that it's not a transplant, but rather a hair system because his hair loss was much more advanced in the first picture, so when the operation happens, the resulting hairdo never looks as full as his.""Some users believe the changes are the result of plastic surgery, with one theorising, ""This is well-done surgery.""However, not everyone is convinced that surgery is involved. One Reddit user opined, ""Honestly, I think a lot of the facial 'changes' are simply due to the much better angle and lighting in the second photo.""As the speculation continues, it's clear that Durov's transformation—whether natural or assisted—has caught the public's eye. The intense scrutiny of his appearance highlights the challenges that come with being in the spotlight, especially for someone as private as Durov. Whether or not he has undergone any procedures, the discussions around his looks reflect a broader societal fascination with image and success.","Pavel Durov, 39, is the founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging app launched in 2013.

NEW DELHI: Football stars are known not only for their extraordinary talent on the pitch but also for the lavish lifestyles that come with their success.Among the most luxurious possessions of these athletes are their private jets . These jets are more than just a means of transportation; they are symbols of their wealth, style, and personal preferences.Without any further ado, we take a closer look at the top five footballers who own some of the most expensive private jets in 2024.Valued at an eye-watering $65 million, Cristiano Ronaldo's Gulfstream G650 is the pinnacle of luxury aviation. Known for its sleek design, high speed, and extended range, this jet allows Ronaldo to jet-set between continents with ease.The G650 offers advanced technology and a spacious, well-appointed cabin, which Ronaldo has personalized to reflect his taste for opulence. It can accommodate up to 18 passengers, making it perfect for the footballer’s business trips and vacations with family.Notably, the Gulfstream G650 is one of the fastest business jets in the world, with a range of 7,000 nautical miles, allowing Ronaldo to fly non-stop from Europe to the Americas. This aircraft is a reflection of Ronaldo’s larger-than-life persona and his penchant for the finest things in life.Zlatan Ibrahimović’s choice of the Cessna Citation Longitude, valued at $27 million, is fitting for a player known for his powerful presence.This aircraft is the epitome of luxury and efficiency, offering a range of 3,500 nautical miles and a cruising speed of 880 km/h. The Cessna Citation Longitude is renowned for its spacious and quiet cabin, allowing Zlatan to relax in utmost comfort during his transcontinental journeys.The jet’s sleek and modern design, along with advanced cockpit technology, aligns with Ibrahimović’s dynamic and forward-thinking approach both on and off the pitch. His Cessna is perfect for long-distance travel, providing him with the flexibility to fly directly to major cities around the world.A true icon both on and off the field, David Beckham’s Bombardier Challenger 350 is valued at $26.6 million.

Notably, it includes features like a full kitchen and Wi-Fi, allowing Messi to stay connected wherever he goes. The personal touches on the jet, such as the names of his wife and children engraved on the steps, highlight his focus on family.Neymar, the Brazilian football sensation known for his style both on and off the field, travels in nothing less than absolute luxury. His private jet, the Embraer Legacy 450, valued at an impressive $25.9 million, is a true reflection of his dynamic personality and extravagant lifestyle.Just like Neymar’s performances on the pitch, the jet combines high performance with sophistication, offering the perfect blend of speed, agility, and comfort.The Embraer Legacy 450 is celebrated for its impressive range of 2,900 nautical miles, making it ideal for Neymar's frequent travels between continents.Whether he’s heading back to Brazil from Europe or jetting off on a holiday, this mid-size business jet ensures he does so in style and comfort. With a cruising speed of Mach 0.83, the Legacy 450 offers Neymar the ability to travel quickly while enjoying the utmost luxury.These footballers have not only made their mark on the field but have also set the bar high when it comes to living the life of luxury.Whether it’s Cristiano Ronaldo’s Gulfstream G650 or David Beckham’s Bombardier Challenger 350, these jets reflect the personalized tastes and desires of each player while offering a glimpse into the elite world of professional football.","Cristiano Ronaldo's Gulfstream G650 is the pinnacle of luxury aviation.
