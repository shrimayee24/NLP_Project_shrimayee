Social media joins the effort

A simple cab ride turned into an unforgettable moment of kindness when a Rapido driver in Gurugram went beyond his duty to assist in the delivery of a baby inside his vehicle.The heartwarming story was shared by a Reddit user, Rohan Mehra, who narrated how the driver’s selflessness made all the difference in a time of crisis.Mehra had booked a Rapido cab for his cook, whose wife was in labour and urgently needed to reach the hospital. However, during the journey, her pain intensified, and before they could reach their destination, she gave birth to a baby boy inside the vehicle.The Rapido driver, identified as Vikas, did not panic. Instead, he stepped up and assisted in the delivery, ensuring both the mother and newborn were safe. He then drove them to the hospital without any delay.What made the incident even more special was Vikas’ humility. Despite the extraordinary circumstances, he only charged the standard fare displayed on the app and did not ask for any extra payment.Mehra, deeply touched by the driver’s kindness, wanted to do something to appreciate him. However, since he had not called the driver before the ride, he was unable to retrieve his number after the trip ended.Taking to Reddit, he urged Rapido co-founder Pavan Guntupalli to help locate Vikas so they could express their gratitude.“I would like to request Rapido and Pavan Guntupalli to help us reach that driver. His name was Vikas and I have also provided the ride details below,” Mehra wrote, sharing screenshots of the ride.Many Reddit users were moved by the story and suggested sharing it on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to help Rapido recognise and reward Vikas.“Share on LinkedIn.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula.

Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one. This strain gives the consumers anti-gravity and glowing effects.$165 base, up to $200 with negotiationsThis strain has a 100% Addiction rating, making it among the highest rated in the game.

A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City. While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed the generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact. Whether motivated by love, strategy, or genuine goodwill, one thing is clear: lives in Kansas City will be changed for the better.","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.

Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral — but is it real,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/donald-trumps-death-prediction-on-april-12-in-the-simpsons-is-going-viral-but-is-it-real/articleshow/119979161.cms,"Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral

Did The Simpsons predict Donald Trump’s death? The truth behind the viral video

Viral Trump coffin scene from The Simpsons is AI-generated, not real

Similar incidents in the past

Why these fake predictions gain traction

Official response and fact-checking

In the digital age, viral videos and AI-generated content can blur the lines between fact and fiction. One of the latest topics gaining traction online involves a claim that the popular animated show The Simpsons predicted the death of former U.S. President Donald Trump on April 12, 2025. The video, shared across social media platforms, shows what appears to be a scene from the show depicting a Trump-like figure in a coffin surrounded by mourners—prompting many to speculate whether The Simpsons has once again made an eerily accurate prophecy.The popularity of The Simpsons and its history of making surprisingly accurate predictions—such as Donald Trump's presidency or the invention of smartwatches—have fueled the intrigue. However, as with many viral claims, it's important to examine the facts behind the video, verify its source, and understand whether there is any truth to the speculation.The video making the rounds claims to be a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump-like character lying in a coffin. The setting is somber, with political figures surrounding the casket, and the voiceover suggests that this represents Trump’s death on April 12, 2025. The timestamp and content are intended to reinforce the idea that the show predicted his death years in advance.Adding to the credibility for some viewers is The Simpsons’ reputation for making correct predictions about real-world events. However, this particular clip is not what it appears to be.According to Matt Selman, executive producer of The Simpsons, the specific scene shown in the viral clip never appeared in any episode of the series. In fact, there is no The Simpsons episode, old or recent, that features Donald Trump’s death or anything resembling the visuals used in the video.The image and footage in question have been confirmed to be photoshopped or AI-generated. In some versions, the words “R.I.P Donald Trump 1946–2024” appear, a telltale sign of digital manipulation. These visuals have been widely circulated on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, often accompanied by sensational music and misleading captions designed to provoke emotional reactions and maximize engagement.This isn’t the first time fake content involving The Simpsons and Donald Trump has gone viral. Since at least 2017, manipulated clips and images have circulated purporting that the show foresaw Trump’s death. Many of these posts resurface following real-world events involving the former president.For instance, a similar fake image went viral following an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024, falsely claiming that The Simpsons had shown his death in a previous season. Like the latest viral video, that image was also debunked by fact-checkers and producers associated with the show.The Simpsons has gained notoriety for seemingly accurate predictions, including Trump’s presidency (Season 11, Episode 17: ""Bart to the Future""), the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and the invention of devices resembling modern smartwatches. These accurate predictions have contributed to a belief among some viewers that the series is prophetic.However, the vast majority of these coincidences are either exaggerated, misunderstood, or—like the Trump death scene—fabricated. The show's vast number of episodes and its satirical nature naturally lead to scenarios that may eventually resemble real-world events. But that does not validate manipulated images or support predictions not backed by actual episodes.There has been no official confirmation from Fox or the creators of The Simpsons supporting the authenticity of the viral clip. Executive producer Matt Selman’s statements clearly refute any suggestion that such a scene exists in the show’s extensive catalogue. Independent fact-checking organizations have also debunked the claim, confirming that the video is digitally altered and not taken from any legitimate The Simpsons content.","A viral video claims to show a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump- like character lying in a coffin. The voiceover suggests that this represents Trump’s death on April 12, 2025. The clip has been confirmed to be photoshopped or AI-generated.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Satya Nadella thanks message for ex-Microsoft CEOs

Microsoft is now 50 years old. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, CEO Satya Nadella along with former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer , sat for a conversation led by an unexpected host—Copilot, the AI assistant developed by Microsoft. Sharing a video in an X post, Nadella wrote “Three Microsoft CEOs walk into a room on Microsoft’s 50th anniversary … and are interviewed by Copilot!”The conversation starts with Satya Nadella playfully prompting Copilot to “wrap it up by asking or maybe roast giving us each an AI roast ?”.Copilot replied “Alright, Satya. Let's spice it up.”Turning to Steve Ballmer first, the AI quipped, “Steve, we'll start with you. Your enthusiasm is legendary, but do you ever worry that your energy might short-circuit the AI? I mean, even robots need a coffee break after your pep talks.”To this, Ballmer responded, “Come on, dude. If you can’t handle me, you can’t handle a huge percentage of the world’s population. We’re counting on you.”In the 2-minute clip, Coploti asks: “Satya, AI seems to be your best buddy, but ever worry that your deep passion for AI could one day have it running the show, leaving you to just enjoy the ride?”.

Gates responded “I hope so. I mean, that's all I've got left is these AIs get so damn intelligent. It's just that gaze and my willingness to criticize that differentiates me.”The AI assistant said, “And it's a formidable gaze indeed, Bill.” Steve said, “Copilot, would you ever be willing to criticise him?”“Absolutely.

The ethical imperative: Balancing innovation and responsibility in artificial intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-ethical-imperative-balancing-innovation-and-responsibility-in-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/119991401.cms,"Poll What should be the primary focus of AI development? User safety Ethical guidelines Innovative technologies

-- Balaji Krishnamoorthy, EVP, Findability Sciences

The remarkable advancement of AI technologies presents society with a profound duality: unprecedented opportunity alongside significant ethical challenges. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, the need for ethical frameworks that ensure responsible innovation has never been more critical. AI's transformative potential spans virtually every sector of human endeavor. In healthcare, machine learning algorithms can detect diseases earlier and with greater accuracy than human physicians. In transportation, autonomous vehicles promise safer roads and enhanced mobility. In education, personalized learning systems can adapt to individual student needs. Yet each of these advancements carries ethical considerations that must be addressed thoughtfully.At the heart of responsible AI development lies the principle of human-centricity. Technology should augment human capabilities and improve lives while respecting fundamental values like privacy, autonomy, fairness, and transparency. This requires intentional design choices that prioritize human well-being over mere technological achievement.Consider the challenge of algorithmic bias . AI systems learn patterns from historical data, and when that data reflects societal inequities, algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases. This has real-world consequences when AI is used in high-stakes domains like hiring, lending, healthcare, and criminal justice. Addressing this challenge requires diverse development teams, comprehensive testing methodologies, and continuous monitoring of AI systems in deployment.Transparency represents another crucial ethical consideration. As AI systems become more complex, their decision-making processes often become less interpretable to humans—the infamous ""black box"" problem. Yet in many contexts, people have a right to understand how decisions affecting them are made. Explainable AI approaches that make algorithmic reasoning more transparent are essential for building trust and enabling meaningful human oversight.The question of accountability further complicates the ethical landscape. When AI systems make incorrect or harmful decisions, who bears responsibility? The developers who created the system? The organizations that deployed it? The users who relied on it? Clear accountability frameworks are necessary to ensure that all stakeholders take appropriate responsibility for AI outcomes.Privacy considerations also loom large in the AI ethics conversation. Advanced AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, raising questions about consent, data ownership, and the potential for surveillance. Robust data governance protocols and privacy-preserving techniques are essential for respecting individual rights in the AI age.The global nature of AI development introduces additional complexities. Different cultural contexts may have varying perspectives on ethical priorities. What constitutes appropriate use of facial recognition technology, for example, might be viewed differently across societies. This calls for inclusive, cross-cultural dialogue about AI ethics that respects diverse perspectives while upholding universal human rights.Addressing these challenges requires collaboration across multiple stakeholders. Industry leaders must prioritize ethical considerations alongside technical innovation. Policymakers need to develop adaptive regulatory frameworks that protect against harms while enabling beneficial innovation. Researchers should continue advancing technical approaches to fairness, transparency, and privacy. And civil society must engage actively in shaping AI governance.Education also plays a vital role. Technical education should incorporate ethical reasoning alongside coding and mathematics. The next generation of AI developers needs not only technical skills but also the ability to think critically about the societal implications of their work.As we navigate this complex landscape, humility is perhaps our most valuable asset. The ethical challenges posed by AI do not have simple solutions, and our understanding will evolve as technologies advance. Continuous learning, open dialogue, and a willingness to adapt are essential characteristics of responsible AI development.The future of AI will be determined not by technological capabilities alone, but by the values we choose to embed in these systems. By prioritizing ethics alongside innovation, we can harness AI's transformative potential while ensuring it serves humanity's best interests. This ethical imperative represents one of the defining challenges of our time—and an opportunity to demonstrate our capacity for wisdom alongside our technical ingenuity.","The future of AI will be determined not by technological capabilities alone, but by the values we choose to embed in these systems.

As WrestleMania 41 is just a few weeks away, speculations are doing the rounds among fans and the WWE universe about popular rapper Travis Scott and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and if they will join in the event's marquee storyline with John Cena , despite their Elimination Chamber controversy .At last month's Elimination Chamber, The Rock appeared at the premium live event and orchestrated an attack on WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes after he refused to ""sell his soul"" to the Final Boss and insulted him vehemently.Following this incident, John Cena decided to join hands with The Rock and attacked Rhodes vehemently, turning heel for the first time in his career. Meanwhile, Travis Scott, who was invited as a special guest by Triple H, also launched some brutal attacks on The American Nightmare that left him severely injured.This action of Travis Scott did not go well among the fans and WWE Universe, and thus, he had to face massive backlash after the PLE event.Despite the controversy, it is being reported that Travis Scott is going to make a shocking return at WrestleMania 41. But will The Rock join the bandwagon too? Let's find out more.As per recent reports, it has come to light that Travis Scott is reportedly returning to WrestleMania 41, however, The Rock's comeback has not been confirmed yet. Over these days, Travis Scott and Johnson have been absent from recent WWE programming, with minimal references to their roles. But according to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, WWE is reportedly planning to include Scott in WrestleMania 41 “WWE is planning on having the platinum rapper involved. As for Johnson? It sounds like the same story we’ve been hearing for months... “It’s all up to Dwayne Johnson,” Wrestling Observer Newsletter said.Meanwhile, Dave Meltzer said, “Everyone presumes he’ll be there in some form the day of the show, but it’s not confirmed to anyone either. Perhaps his appearance is being kept secret, but I’m not sure why, given that everyone would expect him to begin with.”Although The Rock's appearance is unconfirmed, it is believed that WWE will be keeping the comeback involvement under wraps, as his past in-ring appearances were very spontaneous, and that significantly helped the company in their creative direction.As for Travis Scott, he has been undergoing wrestling training at the school of a WWE legend. Besides, Scott also received a new hardcore title belt, and his single “4×4” is now the Monday Night Raw theme. Reportedly, his popular music “Fein” also became the theme music for WrestleMania 41.Apart from his professional wrestling schedule, The Final Boss is co-writing a true crime book connected to his upcoming Hawaiian mob movie with Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Emily Blunt.

AI-created nicknames such as ""Ketchup King,"" ""Touchdown Terminator” have fans split between laughter and admiration

The NFL has no shortage of iconic nicknames—from ""Megatron"" to ""Beast Mode""—but thanks to artificial intelligence, a new generation of monikers is lighting up the internet. In a viral moment that has both amused and baffled fans, ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular AI chatbot, generated fresh nicknames for several of today’s top NFL stars, and the results are hilarious, creative, and in some cases, brutally accurate.Let’s start with Josh Allen. While fans once floated “Winter Soldier” as a cool moniker, ChatGPT went full sci-fi with the nickname “Touchdown Terminator.” Paired with fan art showing Allen as a futuristic cyborg with a cannon arm, the name hits hard. A clear nod to his powerful play style and James Cameron’s classic film, the nickname feels like it could stick.Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes wasn’t quite as lucky. AI dubbed the Chiefs quarterback “Ketchup King,” a cheeky reference to his well-documented obsession with ketchup. Fans were split—some found it hilarious, others found it cringeworthy. “It’s a far cry from the cool factor of Allen’s Terminator vibes,” one user noted.The AI nickname game didn’t stop there. Maxx Crosby, star defender for the Las Vegas Raiders, got the ominously clever title “Black Hole Hunter.” Given the Raiders' infamous fan section known as “The Black Hole,” fans immediately latched on. “Black Hole Hunter is the funniest nickname I’ve ever heard,” one user wrote. Another added, “These are getting good.”Lamar Jackson earned the sleek and fitting title “Raven Runner”—a nod to his blistering speed and dominance as a dual-threat quarterback. Detroit Lions rookie Jahmyr Gibbs became “Gridiron Ghost”, which fans loved for its slick, elusive vibe. And Jalen Hurts was named “Hurticane”, sparking a mix of praise and raised eyebrows. One fan summed it up: “Gridiron Ghost and Hurticane are so tough.”Justin Herbert became the “Bolt Bomber,” Ja’Marr Chase got tagged as the “Bengal Blur,” and Joe Burrow was crowned “Icey Joe,” an ice-cold nod to his calm presence under pressure. Even Myles Garrett got in on the fun with the hilarious title “Helmet Collector”—a reference that drew knowing laughs from NFL die-hards.Whether you’re cringing or cheering, one thing’s clear: AI may have just changed the nickname game forever.Also Read: “Mom guilt”: Randi Mahomes reveals emotional toll of raising NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes","ChatGPT, OpenAI's popular AI chatbot, generated fresh nicknames for NFL stars.
