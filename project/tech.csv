Stefon Diggs hinting at return to Buffalo Bills? #buffalobills #billsmafia #stefondiggs #nflnews

‚ÄúAbsolutely no shot Stefon Diggs goes back to Buffalo lol‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs giving desperateeeeeeü•±‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn't he burn whatever bridges he could find on his way out last time?‚Äù

Stefon Diggs has the internet doing double takes right now. The star wide receiver, who was traded from the Buffalo Bills to the Houston Texans this offseason, just put all his old Bills photoson Instagram. And if you know anything about social media tea, this kind of move isn‚Äôt just casual‚Äîfans are already losing their minds over what it could mean.When the Bills sent Diggs to the Texans in April, it didn‚Äôt seem like the smoothest of exits. The four-time Pro Bowler, who had been vocal about frustrations with the team in the past, wiped his Instagram clean of all things Buffalo. No posts, no memories‚Äîjust gone.Fast forward to now, and every single Bills-related photo has been restored. To make it even spicier, Diggs hasn‚Äôt said a word about it. No caption, no explanation‚Äîjust pure chaos for fans to interpret however they please.Theories are flying everywhere. Some die-hard Bills Mafia members are already manifesting his return, convinced that Diggs wants to undo the trade and come back to Buffalo. Others think it‚Äôs nothing more than a trip down memory lane, a way for him to acknowledge the good times without any actual football implications.Of course, there‚Äôs also the classic case of NFL players using cryptic social media moves to stir the pot. We‚Äôve seen it time and time again‚Äîscrub the team from your bio, post some vague emojis, send fans into a frenzy. Could Diggs be playing the same game?A user commented,Another user hinted at Diggs‚Äô desperation,Some feel that there is absolutely no scope of returning:Right now, he‚Äôs still a Houston Texan. But with social media antics like this, it‚Äôs impossible to ignore the speculation. Maybe he‚Äôs hinting at unfinished business in Buffalo. Maybe he‚Äôs just trolling. Either way, one thing‚Äôs for sure‚Äîthe NFL offseason drama never sleeps, and Stefon Diggs just made things a whole lot more interesting.Also read - The Internet‚Äôs Priceless Reaction to 72-Year-Old Bill Belichick‚Äôs Beach Pics With Jordon Hudson Is Too Good to Miss",Stefon Diggs has the internet doing double takes.

3. Rikishi to come to Jey Uso‚Äôs aid in winning the World Heavyweight Championship

2. The Queen of Stratusfaction might double up Tiffy Time



1. The Texas Rattlesnake to inflict venomous wounds on the Brahma Bull

The Road to WrestleMania has been lit up already and it keeps on getting exciting with every succeeding day. WrestleMania 41 might be big in terms of wrestling icons returning to the ring to craft masterpieces.As WrestleMania 41 has already seen some epic storylines in the mix while speculations soar through the roof about the rest, fans simply cannot wait for the caravan to reach Las Vegas. If John Cena‚Äôs heel turn wasn‚Äôt already a major talking point, now it is about what surprises lie ahead.Until now, four matches have already been booked, even though the stars being a part of the story arc may vary as per late-minute inclusions or detractions. John Cena will be taking on Cody Rhodes for the WWE Undisputed Championship while Tiffany Stratton will be locking horns with Charlotte Flair for the WWE Women‚Äôs Championship.In another couple of match-ups at Las Vegas, Gunther will be defending his title against Jey Uso, and Iyo Sky will be duking it out with Bianca Belair to defend her Women‚Äôs World Championship. With more matches to come and more tales to tell, WWE will also be keen on crafting iconic returns for the Showcase of Immortals. Here are three superstars who can return at WrestleMania 41.Off late, Rikishi has been quite active on social media and has been reacting to the Bloodline posts. With all the speculations garnering momentum, it can well be expected that Jey Uso won‚Äôt be standing alone. Gunther, being the heel, definitely would be doing everything in his arsenal to try to put down Jey. Just when the chips feel down, and Rikishi‚Äôs music could hit, and the fans would be going absolutely bonkers over the father-son duo. Add the Banzai Drop to the mix and the roof‚Äôs coming off in the Allegiant Stadium.Trish Stratus teamed up with Tiffany Stratton at the Elimination Chamber while taking on the duo of Nia Jax and Candice LeRae. Now with Charlotte Flair being the opposition of Tiffany Stratton, there are high chances that another rivalry might take centerstage. Back in 2019, Charlotte went all guns blazing against Trish as a rivalry of generations unfurled. As the duo locked horns at the SummerSlam 2019, it was eventually Flair who won the battle. It is not new for WWE to rekindle the past, and if Trish Stratus costs Charlotte the title, it would be aiding Tiffy and, at the same time, avenging her defeat from six years earlier.Earlier in an interview, Stone Cold Steve Austin used the remark ‚ÄòAnything can happen‚Äô. Since then, it is expected that an age-old rivalry that used to drive the audiences crazy back in the day might be reignited. As The Rock gears up for John Cena‚Äôs challenge against Cody Rhodes, SCSA might come down the pike once again to aid the American Nightmare, thereby sparking a colossal pop that will be one to savor over the years. Whatever the scene is, it won‚Äôt be surprising if the glass breaks all over the titantron once again.Also read: Steve Austin Refuses to Offer John Cena Any Advice After Shocking Heel Turn in WWE","The Road to WrestleMania has been lit up already and it keeps on getting exciting with every succeeding day.

GTA 6 Delayed to 2026? Insider Leak Sparks Panic Among Fans!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/gta-6-delayed-to-2026-insider-leak-sparks-panic-among-fans/articleshow/119119941.cms,"Image via Rockstar

GTA 6 Is Delayed (Kind Of)

Insider Hints at Delay

Development Hurdles = Delays?

Next-level game complexity.

Take-Two Reports: GTA 6 Confirmed for Fall 2025

Rockstar & Take-Two: Still Saying 2025 (But Are They?)

So, Will GTA 6 Be a 2026 Game?

does

Gamers have been counting down to GTA 6 ‚Äôs 2025 release, but with a fresh insider leak, we might be in for some heartbreak. Rockstar‚Äôs been eerily quiet since dropping the first trailer back in December 2023, and now, rumors are swirling that the highly anticipated game might actually be delayed until 2026.A well-connected Rockstar insider, @Mvbrr, recently claimed that a 2025 launch is looking ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù based on recent reports. This tracks with the growing unease in the community‚Äîwhy has there been zero marketing updates since that first trailer?Rockstar‚Äôs past behavior isn‚Äôt exactly reassuring either. Remember how GTA 5: Expanded & Enhanced was originally planned for late 2021 but got pushed to March 2022? Yeah, delays aren‚Äôt new for Rockstar.Jason Schreier, a journalist with a solid track record, has also weighed in. While he hasn‚Äôt confirmed the delay, he did acknowledge that GTA 6 has missed internal deadlines. And let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîRockstar games rarely launch on time. Red Dead Redemption 2? Delayed. GTA 5? Delayed. It‚Äôs basically tradition at this point.The reason?GTA 6 is their biggest, most ambitious project yet, and pushing boundaries means running into roadblocks. On top of that, reports suggest content revisions are happening, particularly around sensitive topics, which could be slowing things down.Officially, Take-Two Interactive insists that GTA 6 is still on track for a Fall 2025 release. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîif a major game is actually hitting in a year, the marketing should be in full swing by now. Instead, we‚Äôve got radio silence.The first trailer broke records, showcasing Vice City and the new Bonnie & Clyde-inspired protagonists, but since then? Crickets. No new trailers, no gameplay reveals, and no official updates. That‚Äôs not a good sign.For now, Take-Two is sticking to its 2025 release promise‚Äîbut history tells us to stay skeptical. Between insider leaks, development struggles, and Rockstar‚Äôs lack of updates, the possibility of a 2026 delay feels very real.The good news? If Rockstarpush the release, it‚Äôs probably to make sure the game meets their ridiculously high standards. The bad news? We might have to wait even longer to step back into Vice City.For now, we‚Äôre all just refreshing Rockstar‚Äôs socials like maniacs and hoping for an update soon. Will GTA 6 really drop in 2025, or is a delay inevitable? Only time will tell.","Rumors are swirling that GTA 6 might actually be delayed until 2026.

Penta‚Äôs brother Rey Fenix could be joining WWE



Rey Fenix in not the only new alleged member to join SmackDown



In a mysterious teaser clip shown to fans on last Friday's episode of WWE SmackDown, on March 14, we got to see a luchador sitting on top of the corner turnbuckles. The identity of the masked man is yet to be revealed, but fans are speculating that someone very familiar could be joining the WWE squared circle. The latest and newest masked wrestler in WWE was Penta - who became one of the biggest names in the promotion soon after he joined. And now, it looks like his brother, Rey Fenix might be making an entrance into the stage as well. But the Lucha Bros are still a far off dream.The former AEW star Rey Fenix might soon join his brother Penta on the WWE roster . The speculations started soon after his contract with the AEW officially and finally came to an end, despite some hiccups. But now that all is done and dusted, it looks like Rey is ready to join his brother in WWE. But as of now, it seems he could be joining WWE under the SmackDown brand instead of RAW, unlike his brother.Many fans were hoping for a Tag-Team duo with the brothers now that Rey Fenix is alleged to be joining WWE. But those aspirations will have to take a back seat for now, unless Triple H and the people working backstage think that bringing back the Lucha Bros to the ring is something they really want. Considered one of AEW‚Äôs best tag teams, the Lucha Bros were once a thing of beauty. But with the rumors currently afloat, chances are Fenix will be making his WWE entry as a standalone star like his brother.The last episode of SmackDown showed not one but two mysterious teaser clips. While one of them is speculated to be of Rey Fenix because of the silhouette shown on the clip and Rey‚Äôs recent update about contract expiration, the other clip did not give us a glimpse into the upcoming star. But what caught everyone‚Äôs eyes was the number 4 that popped up on our screens in the clip.But that was enough for some fans to speculate that Aleister Black could be making his comeback to WWE, after a few okayish years in the AEW. Black was one NXT‚Äôs biggest standout stars before he left WWE to join AEW and run the House of Black as Malakai. But now, with recent updates of his contract having expired with AEW, Black could be making his comeback to WWE alongside Rey Fenix, this time under the SmackDown brand.

Cincinnati Bengals prioritize star players in extension frenzy



Trey Hendrickson Addresses His Upcoming Contract Situation With Bengals On The Pat McAfee Show

The Trey Hendrickson Dilemma: Extension or Trade?



The Cincinnati Bengals are locking in their core with major extensions, securing Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase and Tee Higgins after recently signing Mike Gesicki. Joe Burrow ‚Äôs top targets are set, but star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson ‚Äôs future remains uncertain. With trade rumors swirling and negotiations ongoing, will Cincinnati finalize his deal before the season starts? The clock is ticking on their Super Bowl aspirations.The Bengals entered the offseason with a clear mission: retain their top talent and solidify their core for a championship run. Sunday night saw two major pieces fall into place, as Cincinnati reportedly reached agreements with both Chase and Higgins.Chase, the team‚Äôs electrifying No. 1 receiver, landed a four-year, $161 million extension, with a jaw-dropping $112 million guaranteed. Higgins, the complementary playmaker who has proven invaluable alongside Chase, secured a four-year, $115 million deal. These signings solidify one of the most dangerous receiving duos in the NFL , ensuring Burrow has his go-to targets locked in for years to come.With three of the four targeted players now secured, the spotlight shifts to Hendrickson. The dominant edge rusher has been at the center of trade rumors, but Cincinnati isn‚Äôt letting him go without a fight.Despite granting Hendrickson permission to explore trade opportunities, the Bengals appear committed to keeping him in the fold. According to multiple reports, including those from NFL insiders Tom Pelissero and Jordan Schultz, discussions between the two sides have resumed. While negotiations won‚Äôt be easy, Cincinnati isn‚Äôt backing down from its efforts to extend the four-time Pro Bowler.The Bengals have set a steep asking price for Hendrickson, with one rival GM describing it as ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù This signals Cincinnati‚Äôs reluctance to part ways with their defensive star, especially as they gear up for a Super Bowl push. Given Hendrickson ‚Äôs impact on the pass rush, many argue he should have been prioritized over Higgins. However, if the Bengals can secure his extension, the debate will quickly fade.Also Read: Seahawks add strategic escape clause in Sam Darnold‚Äôs contract for unexpected scenarios With training camp on the horizon and Super Bowl aspirations in sight, Cincinnati‚Äôs front office has one final move to make. Will they lock in Hendrickson and complete their offseason masterclass?

iPhone 17 Air: Apple reportedly considered making iPhone 17 Air portless and slimmer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-reportedly-considered-making-iphone-17-air-portless-and-slimmer/articleshow/119107753.cms,"(Image source: MacRumors)

Apple iPhone 17 Air will be a port-free iPhone

What to expect from the iPhone 17 Air

A single rear camera instead of the dual-camera setup found in the iPhone 17 Pro models.

A lighter chassis made from new materials, possibly titanium or a thinner aluminum frame.

Enhanced MagSafe charging with faster wireless charging speeds.

An improved display with thinner bezels.

Apple iPhone 17 Air could mark the end of charging ports

Improve the durability of iPhones by eliminating entry points for dust and water.

Enhance device aesthetics and allow for an even sleeker design.

Push forward its wireless charging and accessory ecosystem.

Regulatory and consumer challenges

What‚Äôs next for Apple

Apple‚Äôs upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to mark a significant shift in the company's smartphone design philosophy. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple considered launching the device without a USB-C charging port but ultimately decided against it for this model. However, the company is reportedly still working towards a future where iPhones will be completely port-free. The iPhone 17 Air will serve as a precursor to this vision, featuring a significantly slimmer design. While Apple has been transitioning its iPhones from the proprietary Lightning port to USB-C, speculation continues regarding the timeline for a fully wireless iPhone.The concept of a portless iPhone has been discussed within Apple for years. Reports suggest that the company has been gradually moving towards a wireless ecosystem, with advancements in MagSafe charging and improved wireless data transfer speeds. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman, Apple executives believe that if the iPhone 17 Air is successful, it will pave the way for completely port-free models in the near future.Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted that a portless iPhone would arrive as early as 2021, but technological and regulatory hurdles may have delayed its introduction. With USB-C now mandatory in the European Union, Apple may need to balance innovation with compliance before fully eliminating physical charging ports.While details about the iPhone 17 Air remain scarce, leaks suggest that it will feature an ultra-thin and lightweight design. Apple is expected to achieve this reduction in size by optimizing internal components, including a more compact battery and a redesigned logic board.Key rumored features of the iPhone 17 Air include:Apple has historically been a leader in eliminating hardware features before the industry catches up. The company previously removed the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, introduced Face ID in place of Touch ID on flagship models, and transitioned MacBooks to USB-C long before it became a global standard.By removing charging ports, Apple aims to:However, this transition may pose challenges for users who rely on wired charging and data transfer. Professional users who shoot high-resolution videos may find it difficult to transfer large files wirelessly without a fast alternative.A completely portless iPhone would need to comply with regional regulations, particularly in the European Union, where the Common Charger Directive mandates that all mobile phones support USB-C for wired charging. Apple could potentially circumvent this requirement if the device exclusively supports wireless charging.Additionally, consumer acceptance will play a key role in determining whether Apple moves forward with this change. Users who prefer the convenience of wired charging may be hesitant to switch to a wireless-only model, especially if charging speeds and accessory availability do not match current standards.The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be a stepping stone toward Apple‚Äôs long-term goal of a port-free iPhone lineup. If the model performs well in terms of sales and user adoption, future iPhones could follow suit, with Apple refining wireless technologies to fully replace wired alternatives.With MagSafe improvements and advancements in data transfer speeds, Apple is gradually laying the foundation for this shift. While the transition to a completely portless iPhone may not happen immediately, the iPhone 17 Air is a clear indicator of the company‚Äôs direction.Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup in September 2025, where more details about the iPhone 17 Air and its potential impact on future iPhones will be revealed.","The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be a stepping stone toward Apple‚Äôs long-term goal of a port-free iPhone lineup.

New NPS rule from April 1 : The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has enhanced National Pension System (NPS) security by adding a new layer called two-factor Aadhaar authentication . Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing. Following the circular, Aadhaar-based authentication will now be combined with the current user ID and password login system.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

TikTok ban on April 5? Here's why app's future is still unclear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-ban-on-april-5-heres-why-apps-future-is-still-unclear/articleshow/119125973.cms,"Will TikTok be banned on April 5

Why is TikTok facing a ban in the US

Who wants to buy TikTok

Frank McCourt & Alexis Ohanian‚Äôs ""The People‚Äôs Bid for TikTok""

Billionaire Frank McCourt, along with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, has led a consortium to acquire TikTok. They propose integrating blockchain technology into the platform to give users more control over their data.

Investor Kevin O‚ÄôLeary (""Mr. Wonderful"" from Shark Tank)

O‚ÄôLeary joined the McCourt-led consortium in January 2025, advocating for an American-led takeover.

YouTube star MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson)

In January, popular content creator MrBeast expressed interest in buying TikTok, stating on social media that he wanted to acquire the platform to prevent it from being banned. His lawyer later confirmed that he was serious about pursuing the deal.

What happens if TikTok is banned

Removal from US app stores

Google and Apple could be required to remove TikTok from their app stores, preventing new downloads and updates.

Blocking TikTok on US networks

Internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile networks might be directed to block access to TikTok‚Äôs servers, making it difficult for users to access the app.

Legal challenges from TikTok and users

TikTok has already sued the US government over the ban, arguing that it violates First Amendment rights. If the ban is enforced, further legal battles are expected.

A potential workaround

Some users may attempt to bypass restrictions using VPN services, although it is unclear whether the government would take measures to block such efforts.

How long will TikTok be available

Whether ByteDance agrees to sell TikTok to a US-based entity.

If the US government extends the deadline beyond April 5.

Potential legal battles that could delay or overturn the ban.

The future of TikTok in the United States remains uncertain as the April 5 deadline for a potential ban approaches. The short-video app, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, has been at the center of national security concerns for years. Initially targeted for a ban by former President Donald Trump in 2020, the app has faced increasing scrutiny from lawmakers, citing worries over potential data privacy risks and alleged ties to the Chinese government.In April 2024, the US Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US-based entity or face a nationwide ban. The Supreme Court later upheld this law, setting the stage for an April 5, 2025, deadline for ByteDance to comply. However, the situation remains fluid, with ongoing negotiations, legal challenges, and speculation about a possible extension.As the deadline approaches, TikTok users and content creators are left wondering what will happen next. Will the app be banned, or will ByteDance strike a deal to sell the platform? Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the latest developments and what they mean for TikTok‚Äôs future in the US.Whether TikTok will remain available to US users after April 5 depends on ByteDance‚Äôs ability to find a suitable American buyer for the platform. The law mandates that ByteDance either divests from TikTok or face a ban. However, there is still uncertainty regarding enforcement and the possibility of extensions.On March 6, 2025, President Donald Trump indicated that he was open to extending the deadline beyond April 5. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of interest in TikTok,‚Äù Trump told reporters. ‚ÄúHopefully, China will approve of the deal.‚Äù According to reports, Trump can extend the deadline by up to 90 days if ByteDance is actively working toward selling the platform.While the Attorney General‚Äôs Office, led by Pam Bondi, is responsible for enforcing the ban, it remains unclear whether immediate action will be taken if the sale deadline passes without resolution.The push to ban TikTok stems from concerns over national security, data privacy, and foreign influence. The US government fears that TikTok‚Äôs Chinese ownership allows the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to access sensitive user data.In 2022, reports surfaced that ByteDance employees had improperly accessed US user data, including the locations of journalists, raising alarms in Washington. While ByteDance has denied any connection to the Chinese government and implemented security measures to protect US user data, skepticism remains.The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in April 2024, aims to address these concerns by requiring TikTok to be transferred to a US-based entity. The Supreme Court later upheld the law, affirming the government‚Äôs authority to force a sale or impose a ban.Several high-profile figures and companies have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok. President Trump previously mentioned that four different groups were negotiating to buy the platform, although no formal deal has been announced.Among the potential buyers are:Despite these bids, ByteDance has not publicly announced its willingness to sell TikTok, adding further uncertainty to the situation.If TikTok is officially banned on April 5 (or at a later date if the deadline is extended), several scenarios could unfold:As of now, TikTok remains fully operational in the US, with no immediate restrictions. However, its fate depends on:If ByteDance does not comply with the sale requirement, the US government could begin enforcing restrictions on TikTok in the weeks or months following the deadline. However, President Trump‚Äôs recent comments suggest that an extension is likely, giving ByteDance more time to negotiate a deal.","The future of TikTok in the United States remains uncertain as the April 5 deadline for a potential ban approaches.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on 'AI for Robots'

Google‚Äôs Gemini AI model is reportedly removing watermarks from images, including those from Getty Images and other stock media providers, according to a TechCrunch report. Many users on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit have reported that the model can remove watermarks from images and reconstruct the underlying content. This comes days after Google expanded access to its Gemini 2.0 Flash model‚Äôs image generation feature, which allows the model to generate and edit images.Gemini 2.0 Flash is currently labeled as ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù and ‚Äúnot for production use.‚Äù It is available through Google‚Äôs developer tools, including AI Studio. The model does not always successfully remove watermarks, particularly those that are semi-transparent or cover large portions of an image.Other AI models, such as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o, include restrictions on watermark removal from images and videos. These models explicitly refuse to perform such actions, with Claude describing watermark removal as ‚Äúunethical and potentially illegal.‚ÄùUnder US copyright law, removing a watermark without the consent of the original owner is generally considered illegal, except in rare cases.Introducing the AI models last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote on Twitter, ""We‚Äôve always thought of robotics as a helpful testing ground for translating AI advances into the physical world. Today we‚Äôre taking our next step in this journey with our newest Gemini 2.0 robotics models.

From Body Slams to Big Moves: Where are these 3 former WWE female superstars?

1. Sable

2. AJ Lee

3. Amy Weber

For decades, WWE has been the breakthrough for many of the top megastars that we know in the modern day. Not only has the world of pro wrestling witnessed numerous superstars come and go, but it is known for the dramatic comebacks that leave the fans awestruck. While many make a name by being inside the squared circle, many find their destiny outside of it, and the ring only remains as a chapter, not the entire book. Just like many, these 3 former WWE female icons have embraced a life away from the spotlight they once prospered in.Rena Marlette Lesnar, better known by her ring name Sable, was a towering sensational presence in the world of WWE. Sable gained widespread recognition for her involvement in controversial storyline involvements and performing beside the top-tier stars during her tenure, mainly during the late 1990s. The former WWE Diva departed from WWE in 2004 following the beginning of her relationship with former UFC star and WWE icon Brock Lesnar.Despite Sable‚Äôs controversial reputation inside the organization, her departure from the company was on good terms. In the modern-day scenario, the retired model, actress, and professional wrestler enjoys a life away from the limelight and probably has no plans to return. After Sable‚Äôs husband, Lesnar‚Äôs name emerged in the legal battle against Vince McMahon and WWE, the former WWE Diva has stood strong and not budged amid the ongoing speculations around Brock Lesnar‚Äôs name.AJ Lee is one of the most known names of female pro wrestlers, despite stepping down from the ring in 2015. The WWE Diva made her but in the world of pro wrestling with WWE‚Äôs developmental brand NXT and was quick enough to become a part of the main roster by 2011 alongside Kaitlyn as a tag team partner. During her WWE tenure, Lee was widely popular not just for her stunning high-flying moves inside the ring but also for her love-bombing tactics, especially for on-stage romances with megastars like John Cena and Dolph Ziggler.Lee‚Äôs wrestling career came to an unexpected halt after the female superstar suffered neck and cervical injuries during her in-ring bout. Due to the severity of the injuries the star sustained, WWE has to retire the female diva for her health's sake. Before her departure from the ring, Lee tied the knot with Phil Brooks, better known as CM Punk. Even though she left WWE in 2015, her post-wrestling ventures are widely known as well. She serves as a mental health advocate and has been a screenwriter for years. In her memoir, Lee mentioned that her injuries during her wrestling career would keep her off the wrestling magic for as long as she could think of. While numerous speculations swirl around Lee‚Äôs WWE return, it might not be any time soon.Best known for her time in WWE as WWE Diva and JBL‚Äôs Cabinet member, Weber is one of many who thrived outside the squared circle. Despite having a brief stint with WWE, Weber‚Äôs career transitions elevated her life for the better. After being associated with WWE from 2004 to 2005, Weber stepped into the real estate business. Apart from real estate, she has been working in multiple industries like modeling, music, and movies.The former WWE diva‚Äôs music album, Let It Rain, is the official single for which it remained in the U.S Billboard chart for over a month. Even though Weber‚Äôs WWE career was short-lived, she has been a thriving personality in the entertainment and business world.While their time in WWE may have ended, these former WWE female wrestlers did not fade into anonymity; they reinvented themselves. Whether they step inside the ring again or not, their lives changed significantly for their good after exiting the thriving world of WWE.Also Read: Steve Austin Refuses to Offer John Cena Any Advice After Shocking Heel Turn in WWE","Sable, AJ Lee and Amy Weber are three former WWE female superstars.

Vikings Release Garrett Bradbury After Signing Ryan Kelly



Ryan Kelly Signs His Contract with Minnesota Vikings

The Minnesota Vikings have officially parted ways with center Garrett Bradbury after securing the services of veteran Ryan Kelly from the Indianapolis Colts. Bradbury's release marks a significant shift in the Vikings‚Äô offensive line strategy as they aim to strengthen their interior line with experienced talent.Garrett Bradbury, who was selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, had been a consistent presence for the Vikings over the past six seasons. He started all 17 regular-season games last year, including a playoff appearance, and has made 88 starts out of a possible 100 games since joining the team. However, with the Vikings signing Kelly to a two-year deal with $9.235 million guaranteed, Bradbury's departure became inevitable.The Vikings will designate Bradbury's release as a post-June 1 move, which will free up $5.25 million in cap space while leaving $814,000 in dead money for the upcoming season. His current cap figure will remain on the books until June 2, so the additional cap room will only be available after that date. The Vikings‚Äô attempt to trade Bradbury fell through as no team was willing to take on his $4.09 million salary.Following his release, Bradbury has already been linked to the New England Patriots. According to ESPN‚Äôs Mike Reiss, the Patriots, who recently cut veteran center David Andrews, have shown interest in Bradbury. Reiss noted on Sunday that while the Patriots were not interested in trading for Bradbury due to his salary, they could actively pursue him now that he is a free agent.Bradbury, who will turn 30 in June, has had an up-and-down career in terms of performance. He was ranked as the 10th-best center in the league by Pro Football Focus during the 2022 season. However, his overall performance declined over the past two years, ranking 31st and 33rd among centers. Last season, Bradbury earned the 14th-highest run-blocking grade among centers, reflecting his solid contribution in the ground game despite his struggles in pass protection.The release of Bradbury is part of a broader effort by the Vikings to reshape their roster through aggressive moves in free agency. In addition to Ryan Kelly, the Vikings signed guard Will Fries and strengthened their defense by adding Jonathan Allen, Javon Hargrave, and cornerback Isaiah Rodgers. The team also brought in linebacker Eric Wilson and offensive tackle Justin Skule for added depth.The Vikings‚Äô front office remains active in the market, as evidenced by their recent free-agent visit with cornerback Jeff Okudah. The former third overall pick in the 2020 draft has struggled with injuries throughout his career but remains a high-upside talent. After playing for Atlanta in 2023 and Houston in 2024, Okudah is looking for a fresh start, and Minnesota could offer him that opportunity.Also Read: NFL teams make history with unprecedented move ahead of 2025 Draft after 55 years Bradbury's departure signals a new era for the Vikings‚Äô offensive line, with Ryan Kelly expected to bring more stability and leadership to the center position. As for Bradbury, his next chapter may soon unfold in New England, where the Patriots are in need of an experienced anchor for their offensive line.","Minnesota Vikings have released center Garrett Bradbury.
