A Performance That Will Be Analyzed for Years

Super Bowl halftime shows are often grand spectacles, but Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl LIX performance was something entirely different. It wasn’t just a show—it was a statement. With a mix of deep symbolism, cultural nods, and bold artistic choices, Lamar turned the stage into a storytelling platform that left fans talking long after the final note. From hidden messages in his wardrobe to surprise celebrity appearances, here’s everything that made this performance unforgettable.One of the most striking visual elements of the night was Lamar’s jacket, which prominently displayed the word “GLORIA” across the front. At first glance, this seemed like a direct nod to his song “Gloria” from his highly anticipated upcoming album. However, the significance ran much deeper. The word “Gloria”—which translates to “glory” in Spanish—encapsulated Lamar’s unwavering commitment to his craft, his relentless pursuit of artistic excellence, and his place in the pantheon of hip-hop’s greats. More than just a fashion statement, the jacket served as a powerful emblem of his belief in music as a transformative force—one that can elevate, challenge, and ultimately shape culture.In a surprise moment, Hollywood icon Samuel L. Jackson took the stage dressed as Uncle Sam, a well-known symbol of the U.S. government. His presence wasn’t just for show—Jackson's character praised Lamar for “slowing things down” before the rapper launched into his now-infamous performance of, a diss track aimed at Drake. The moment was seen as a critique of the way mainstream institutions attempt to control and censor artists who speak truth to power.Lamar’s dancers were dressed in solid red, white, and blue outfits. Some thought this was a reference to gang culture, but others saw a deeper meaning. At one point, the dancers formed the American flag, with Lamar literally dividing them—possibly making a statement about the divisions in America today. It was a visual representation of the struggles faced by Black artists navigating the complexities of fame, power, and societal expectations.Tennis superstar Serena Williams shocked fans when she took the stage and performed the C-Walk, a dance move deeply rooted in West Coast hip-hop culture. This wasn’t just a fun dance moment—it was a powerful cultural statement. And given Williams' past rumored relationship with Drake, some saw it as an added jab in the ongoing Lamar-Drake feud.Lamar didn’t hold back when it came to his beef with Drake. Midway through his performance, he dropped the line,It was a direct response to Drake’s recent lawsuit and a declaration of Lamar’s dominance in the industry. He wrapped up the set with the phrase, making it clear that, in his mind, the battle was already won.Lamar started the performance in a black Buick GNX, a car with deep personal significance. The Buick GNX is a symbol of classic American muscle, but it’s also a direct reference to his past and his journey from Compton to superstardom. The car, which has been referenced in his music before, represents resilience, struggle, and triumph.One unexpected moment came when a protester pulled out a banner featuring the flags of Palestine and Sudan, along with a heart and a raised fist. The individual was quickly removed from the stage, but the image spread rapidly online. While this wasn’t part of Lamar’s planned performance, it added another layer of political discourse to the night.Kendrick Lamar didn’t just perform at Super Bowl LIX—he made a statement. From his outfit choices to his guest appearances, every aspect of the show carried meaning. Whether you saw it as a lyrical masterpiece, a cultural battle, or a political statement, one thing is certain: Lamar’s halftime show wasn’t just entertainment—it was history in the making.Also read - Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show: Everything that went wrong with the Kendrick Lamar performance","Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl LIX performance was something entirely different.

Some concerned fans called for witchcraft to be outlawed, while others shrugged it off as just a harmless game-day ritual.one person wrote. Another simply laughed it off:Regardless of whether voodoo had anything to do with it, Mahomes did not look like his usual self.

Jets Take Control: No More Unfiltered Rodgers on McAfee’s Show

The Pat McAfee Show

Power Move by the Jets—But Will Aaron Rodgers Accept It?

If Aaron Rodgers wants to remain with the New York Jets next season, he’ll have to make a major sacrifice—his weekly spot on. According to reports, the Jets have drawn a line in the sand, telling Rodgers he can’t appear on the show anymore if he wants to stay on the team in 2025.For the past few seasons, Rodgers’ candid, often controversial interviews onhave been a must-watch. He’s used the platform to talk about football, vaccines, conspiracy theories, team dynamics, and more, often making headlines for his unfiltered takes. But it seems the Jets’ front office has had enough.As reported, the team sat Rodgers down and laid out their expectations: If he stays, the McAfee appearances must stop. This decision appears to be an attempt to regain control over the team’s image and prevent off-field distractions—something that became a recurring theme in Rodgers' first season in New York.When the Jets traded for Rodgers in 2023, expectations were sky-high. Fans believed he could lead them to the playoffs—or even a Super Bowl. But just four snaps into the season, disaster struck. Rodgers tore his Achilles, ending his campaign before it even started.From that point on, Rodgers’ biggest presence in the NFL wasn’t on the field—it was on McAfee’s show. He made headlines for criticizing the media, questioning COVID-related policies, and openly discussing Jets-related drama. His appearances kept the Jets in the news for all the wrong reasons, frustrating fans, media, and—apparently—his own team.This decision signals that the Jets want to regain control of their locker room and media narrative.But there’s one big problem: Aaron Rodgers does not like being told what to do and fans could agree.Rodgers has always done things his way. Whether it’s skipping OTAs, embracing unconventional medical treatments, or taking controversial stances, he’s never been one to follow the rules. Now, the Jets are essentially forcing him to choose—his love for open mic sessions on McAfee’s show or his future in New York.With this ultimatum in place, all eyes are on Rodgers’ next move. Will he accept the Jets' conditions and stay in New York? Or will he see this as an attack on his independence and force his way out?What do you think? Should the Jets be policing Rodgers’ media appearances, or are they making the right call to avoid more distractions?Also read - Viral Video Shows Woman Using ‘Voodoo’ on Patrick Mahomes During Super Bowl LIX",The New York Jets have reportedly told Aaron Rodgers he can't appear on Pat McAfee's show anymore if he wants to stay on the team in 2025.

Harry Bolz Meaning: Elon Musk changes his X (formerly Twitter) profile name to Harry Bolz: What does it mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-changes-ex-name-to-harry-bolz-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/118146142.cms,"What Does Harry Bōlz Mean?

April 2023: The ‘Harry Bōlz’ Incident

December 2024: ‘Kekius Maximus’ and Internet Subcultures

Why Does Musk Change His Name?

Humour and Entertainment – Many of Musk’s social media antics, including his name changes, seem intended to amuse both himself and his audience.

Cultural References – He frequently taps into online trends and memes, demonstrating his awareness of internet subcultures.

Disruptive Marketing – By generating discussions around his name changes, Musk keeps attention on his X profile and maintains engagement with his audience.

Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, marking the second time he has adopted this alias. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023. His latest stunt comes just hours after reports emerged that a Musk-led consortium of investors has placed a bid to take control of OpenAI.The 53-year-old, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is currently making cuts across multiple federal agencies in an effort to reduce government spending.Musk likely used the name as a play on words, referencing the slang term ‘hairy balls’. While the reason behind his latest name change remains unclear, Musk previously explained the joke in a tweet back in 2023.Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), is well known for his unpredictable and often humorous online behaviour. Among his many quirks is a habit of changing his display name on the platform, sometimes as a joke and other times as a cryptic nod to internet culture. While Musk has altered his name multiple times, two notable instances stand out—his brief use of “Harry Bōlz” in April 2023 and “Kekius Maximus” in December 2024.In April 2023, Musk changed his display name on X to ""Harry Bōlz."" At the time, the reasoning behind this move was not immediately clear. However, it was widely interpreted as a joke, playing on the phonetic similarity to “hairy balls,” a slang term often used in internet humour.Musk is no stranger to wordplay and internet memes, frequently engaging in online jokes and trolling. His use of ""Harry Bōlz"" fit well within his typical approach to social media, where he enjoys posting lighthearted, and sometimes controversial, content. This name change also followed a period of heightened attention on Musk’s management of X, as he had taken over the platform in late 2022 and made several sweeping changes, including layoffs and policy updates.While Musk did not provide a detailed explanation for the name change at the time, he later addressed it in a tweet, confirming that it was indeed a joke. The name was short-lived, as Musk quickly reverted to his usual display name.On December 31, 2024, Musk once again changed his display name, this time to ""Kekius Maximus."" Alongside the name change, he updated his profile picture to an image of Pepe the Frog dressed as a Roman gladiator.The term ""Kekius Maximus"" is a reference to ""kek,"" a term popularised in online gaming and internet meme culture. Originating from World of Warcraft, ""kek"" became associated with internet communities, particularly those engaged in political memes and satire. The name ""Maximus"" is a reference to ancient Roman culture, evoking the title of a powerful general or emperor.By adopting ""Kekius Maximus,"" Musk was making a playful nod to these internet subcultures. The move sparked discussion among his followers, as some saw it as a lighthearted joke, while others speculated that Musk was aligning himself with certain meme-driven online movements. His use of Pepe the Frog, a character that has been widely used in memes across different communities, added another layer of interpretation to his display name change.Musk's tendency to change his display name on X aligns with his broader online persona. He has often embraced internet culture, meme humour, and trolling, using X as a platform to engage with his followers in an informal and often unpredictable manner. His name changes appear to serve multiple purposes:",Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023.

Shedeur Sanders Takes First Step Toward NFL, Schedules Draft Visits With Browns, Giants



With the 2024-25 football season officially over, the NFL draft season is in full swing. The highly anticipated event, where top college prospects fulfill lifelong dreams, is now less than 75 days away. Leading up to it, teams will host Pro Days, the NFL Combine, and 30 visits. Among the prospects, Shedeur Sanders has already confirmed visits with the Cleveland Browns (No. 2 pick) and the New York Giants (No. 3 pick), setting the stage for a crucial pre-draft evaluation.As the 2025 NFL Draft draws closer, Shedeur Sanders has started making moves toward his professional football career. The Colorado star quarterback confirmed in a recent video from Well Off Media that he has scheduled pre-draft visits with the Cleveland Browns and New York Giants, marking the beginning of what is expected to be a busy period of team meetings and evaluations.Sanders shared further details in a video posted by ESPN Cleveland, where he revealed that his first official visit is already locked in. ""30 visits start like March 4,"" he stated, before confirming his initial stops. ""Browns. I got the Browns then the Giants.""The Browns, holding the No. 2 overall pick, are in a strong position to draft a high-caliber quarterback like Sanders. Given the struggles of Deshaun Watson, who has failed to meet expectations since his controversial signing, Cleveland may be looking to reset at the position. Whether they opt for Sanders, Miami’s Cam Ward, or another top prospect may depend on the Tennessee Titans, who hold the No. 1 overall selection and could shape the early draft landscape.Meanwhile, the Giants, picking at No. 3, are also in the quarterback market. After parting ways with Daniel Jones, New York is widely expected to pursue a new franchise signal-caller. If Sanders impresses in his meetings, the Giants could be motivated to make a move—either securing him at No. 3 or even trading up if they feel the need to outmaneuver Cleveland.Sanders has established himself as one of college football’s elite quarterbacks over the past two seasons. In 2024, he dominated the Big 12, leading the conference in passing yards (3,926), touchdowns (35), completion percentage (74.2%), and efficiency rating (168.8). His overall stats for the season—4,134 passing yards, 37 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions—helped propel Colorado to a 9-3 record.His journey to the NFL has been closely guided by his father, Deion Sanders, who recently discussed his son’s ambitions on First Take. While reflecting on Shedeur’s draft prospects, Coach Prime shared his son's ultimate goal: to be drafted higher than Deion was, aiming for a top-four selection.Also Read: New York Jets Move On from Aaron Rodgers: What’s Next for the Four-Time MVP?

Al-Nuri Mosque: Iraq’s leaning 'hunchback' minaret rises again after years in ruins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-leaning-hunchback-minaret-rises-again-after-years-in-ruins/articleshow/117977421.cms,"The Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq, has been rebuilt, restoring its historic presence after being destroyed during ISIS rule. Known as the ""hunchback"" minaret, it earned its name due to its leaning shape.Unesco spearheaded the restoration of this architectural marvel, which stands as part of the Al-Nuri Mosque , utilising original brickwork in the reconstruction process.Abdullah Mahmoud from Iraq's antiquities department expressed the significance: ""Al-Hadba is our identity, and restoring it means the city has reclaimed its identity"". The 12th-century structure maintains its distinctive 160-centimetre lean, identical to its tilt in the 1960.The Al-Nuri Mosque, where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his self-styled caliphate in July 2014, was razed in June 2017 during Mosul's liberation battle. Iraqi officials stated that IS forces planted explosives before withdrawing.The five-year Unesco restoration incorporated 26,000 original bricks for the exterior, with 96,000 new bricks added internally for structural support. The foundation received additional reinforcement to stabilise the tilt.The restoration effort extended to the mosque's columns, dome and courtyard. The mihrab was restored using original stonework, whilst the minbar required substantial reconstruction due to missing original components.Former muezzin Imad Zaki observes the restoration daily, stating: ""Every day I stand here for an hour to watch as they are restored to their original state. Today one can feel the spirituality. It's as if our souls have finally found peace.""Unesco's broader restoration initiative includes the Al-Tahira Church from 1862, featuring reconstructed arcades, pillars and stained-glass windows. Archaeological discoveries include an underground cellar and wine vessels, now displayed beneath glass flooring.Unesco Iraq's senior project manager Maria Acetoso noted the transformation: ""When I arrived here in 2019, it looked like a ghost city. In five years plus, there has been a massive change.""Despite progress, Mosul's recovery continues. The clearance of 12,000 tonnes of debris was necessary for landmark restoration, whilst numerous neighbourhoods remain damaged.In the Old City, buildings marked 'safe' in red indicate explosive clearance. Many former inhabitants, particularly Christians, await return.Mohammed Kassem, now residing in a new dwelling, believes the city requires further reconstruction and the return of its original residents, particularly the Christian community.Saad Mohammed, 65, residing opposite Al-Nuri Mosque, recounts the IS period: ""We opened the window once and saw the black IS flag on top of the minaret. Then we opened it again, and the minaret was gone."" Now, with restored landmarks, he remarks, ""Today the minaret has risen again. Now we feel safe.""","Unesco spearheaded the restoration of the Al-Hadba minaret in Mosul, Iraq.

Bill Gates Reveals Steve Jobs' LSD Suggestion to Boost Microsoft: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-recounts-steve-jobs-urging-him-to-take-lsd-to-boost-microsoft-report/articleshow/118133220.cms,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed about his experimentation with drugs like LSD and Cannabis with Apple founder Steve Jobs during his teenage years.In an interview to The Independent, Gates said that he tried a lot of things because his personality is kind of optimistic, and he was willing to take risks.“But another thing about my personality is that I like my mind to work and be very logical. So I stopped doing even marijuana early in my 20s just because it made my mind sloppy, either during or the day afterwards,” Gates said.“I smoked pot in high school, but not because it did anything interesting. I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn't succeed, so I gave it up,” he added.Microsoft co-founder said that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who didn’t know about his past drug use, teased him on the subject.“Steve Jobs once said that he wished I'd take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,” recalled Gates.“My response to that was to say, ‘Look, I got the wrong batch.’ I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him! Because his talents and mine, other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits, they didn't overlap much. He wouldn’t know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that... I envy those skills. I'm not in his league,” he added.Gates added that he was a fan of Michael Pollan’s book about psychedelic drugs , How To Change Your Mind, and is intrigued by the idea that they may have therapeutic uses. “The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating,” said Gates. “Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.”Gates expressed interest in the potential therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs, referencing Michael Pollan's book ""How To Change Your Mind.""""The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating. Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.""In his memoir, Gates describes his first LSD experience, which culminated in an unsettling dental appointment the following day while still under the drug's influence.The book reveals another LSD experience shared with future Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and friends while watching Kung Fu. During this episode, they traced mathematical symbols on a dewy car trunk.""The two backwards Es together, side by side, to him, to us, held some profound meaning. 'Bill, see this. Existence exists,' he said as we stared at the dewy car trunk. It was one of those moments that seem perfectly cosmic at the time and purely silly once the acid wears off.""Gates ultimately stopped taking LSD due to concerns about potential memory loss. He worried about the possibility of accidentally erasing his memories, comparing his brain to a computer's data storage system.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed about his experimentation with drugs like LSD and Cannabis with Apple founder Steve Jobs during his teenage years.

The 47-year-old rapper's recent antics both online and in public have raised concerns about his mental health and behaviour.The controversy began on the Grammys red carpet, where West made headlines by asking his wife, Bianca Censori, to remove her black coat, revealing a provocative see-through dress to photographers. West later boasted that Bianca's Google search numbers had surpassed those related to the Grammy Awards.However, it was West's online behaviour that triggered alarm bells. In a podcast interview, he dismissed claims of bipolar disorder, asserting instead that he is autistic, a statement met with scepticism. His X account soon became a platform for unfiltered and offensive content, including anti-Semitic, misogynistic, and racist remarks. West even went as far as declaring himself a Nazi, promoting Nazi-themed merchandise on his website, criticising overweight women, and sharing porn.Prominent figures like David Schwimmer and Piers Morgan publicly demanded the suspension of West's account. In response to the growing criticism, West posted cryptic messages, hinting at his potential removal, ""Elon stopped following me, so I don't know how much longer I'll be on Twitter / X. If I'm deleted, go to [link to his merchandise site].""In what appeared to be a farewell post, West wrote, ""I'm logging out of Twitter. I appreciate Elon for allowing me to vent. It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board. It was like an Ayahuasca trip. Love all of you who gave me your energy and attention. To we connect again. Good afternoon and good night.""Following an additional tirade about Taylor Swift during the Super Bowl, West's account was officially deactivated. Musk later confirmed that the rapper's account had been flagged as ""NSFW"" (not safe for work) and assured that the public ""won't be seeing"" West's posts due to their nature.",Elon Musk has removed Kanye West's account from the social media platform.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia has found himself at the center of a controversy following his appearance as a judge on comedian Samay Raina 's roast show, India's Got Latent . During the episode, Allahbadia asked a contestant an inappropriate question: “Would you rather watch your parents have sex for the rest of your life or join them once to put a stop to it?” The comment triggered widespread backlash on social media, with users condemning it as offensive and inappropriate.In response to the outrage, Allahbadia issued an apology via a video message. “My comment was not just inappropriate, it was not even funny. Comedy is not my forte. I’m here to say sorry. Many of you asked if this is how I wish to use my platform, and obviously, this is not it. I had a lapse in judgment, and it was not cool on my part,” he said, adding that he wouldn’t offer justifications or excuses.Amid the controversy, Magicpin , a food delivery app, seized the opportunity to poke fun at the situation. In a cheeky post on X, the company shared an image of a billboard ad that read, “INDIA'S LOST TALENT.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.
