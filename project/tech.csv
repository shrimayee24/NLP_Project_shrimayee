Dating today requires more than just texts Charissa Thompson and Erin Andrews say it's time to make real moves

Charissa Thompson’s recent dating advice stands out not just for its honesty but for flipping the script on traditional male dating behavior. Instead of advising men to “play it cool,” she encourages the opposite to be clear and confident.In a recent episode of the Calm Down podcast ,Charissa Thompson and Erin Andrews delved into the nuances of dating, offering candid advice to their listeners.Charissa took a moment to address a relatable question many people have silently pondered: How subtle is too subtle in the early stages of showing interest? The question came from a viewer who wrote, ""Crushing on this girl, I start most chats laying low to see if she will engage me, bad move?""Rather than sugar coating it, Thompson leaned into her signature no-nonsense style. “I like a guy that is going to make it very obvious that he likes me,” she said, emphasizing that there's power in transparency. But she didn’t stop there. The advice came with a crucial caveat, don’t cross the line into clingy territory.“If you’re sending, if there’s a lot of, I always say this, in a text chain, if there’s a lot of blue and there’s not a lot of the gray, we need to ease off the old gas pedal,” Charissa said.“If you’re initiating the chats, that’s fine. That shows that you’re interested. But is she just like sending you one-word responses? Is she sending you, like, you need to do something to keep the conversation and the activities like moving forward.”She voiced what many have felt but hesitated to say out loud: ""Because just like the back and forth after a while, I know the very limited time I was actually dating, I would hate it when it’d just be like pen pal. I’m like, are we doing something? Are we not doing something?""Her point was crystal clear there’s a fine line between building a connection and wasting time. She added, ""Like you’re the guy, you make the plan and if I’m on board, then I’ll just come in and come up with ideas."" It’s a call for initiative something that too often gets lost in today’s drawn-out digital exchanges.Joining the discussion, Erin Andrews chimed in with a grounded take on when it’s time to stop waiting and start walking away.Taking a cue from Charissa’s “love guru hat,” she posed a rhetorical gut-check for anyone stuck in texting limbo, “How long have you been starting up the chats and laying low? Because if it’s been a while, it may be time to either say, hey, what, are we good? Are we moving on? Or maybe time for you to move on.”Also read: No contract, no problem? Erin Andrews drops bombshell on career-defining moment Together, their exchange highlighted a shared frustration with passive dating patterns. Their takeaway?

In a world driven by technological advancements, the smartphone stands out as one of the most transformative inventions of the 21st century. It has revolutionised communication, reshaped business, and brought the vastness of the internet into the palms of billions. However, alongside these undeniable benefits, smartphones have also introduced a host of psychological, physical, and social challenges that threaten human well-being.Decades ago, Baba Vanga , the enigmatic Bulgarian mystic known for her eerily accurate prophecies, reportedly warned about a small, addictive device that would dominate human lives, leading to widespread mental distress and social decay. As smartphones become ever more entrenched in daily life, her chilling prediction appears more relevant than ever. This article delves into the profound impacts of smartphone addiction, highlighting the health risks, psychological consequences, and societal challenges that echo Vanga's grim vision.Baba Vanga, often referred to as the "" Nostradamus of the Balkans ,"" is known for her unsettlingly accurate prophecies. Among her many predictions, one stands out in the context of modern technology – a warning about humanity’s growing dependence on small electronic devices. Although Vanga made this prediction long before the smartphone era, her vision seems to perfectly capture the modern phenomenon of mobile addiction. She foresaw a future where these devices, initially celebrated for their convenience, would disrupt human relationships, undermine mental health, and alter the fabric of society.Her prediction aligns eerily with the reality of today, where smartphones have become indispensable but potentially dangerous tools, contributing to anxiety, social isolation, and physical health problems.Smartphone addiction is not just a problem for one generation – it spans all age groups, affecting children, teenagers, adults, and even the elderly. This widespread impact reflects Vanga’s prophecy of a technology that would infiltrate every aspect of human life.Children are among the most vulnerable to the effects of excessive smartphone use, as their developing brains are particularly sensitive to digital stimuli. According to a report by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in India, nearly 24% of children regularly use smartphones before bed, a habit that disrupts sleep patterns and cognitive development.Adults are not immune to the lure of smartphones. In fact, they often face even more profound consequences due to the high-pressure environments of work and personal life.The physical and psychological effects of smartphone addiction are severe, often leading to long-term health issues that can be difficult to reverse.The impact of smartphone addiction extends beyond individual health, disrupting social dynamics and weakening family relationships.Given the widespread impact of smartphone addiction, it is crucial to adopt strategies to reduce screen time and restore digital balance.","Baba Vanga’s chilling warning about smartphones impacts different age groups.

Apple Pay outage: Widespread user reports highlight major disruption

Impact on users and financial transactions

Apple Pay , one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025, affecting thousands of users across the United States. As per reports, the disruption, which began around 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time left many unable to make transactions, access their digital wallets, or use related services like Apple Cash and Apple Card. While Apple has since restored most of its services, the incident highlights the growing dependency on digital financial systems and the potential challenges they face.The first signs of the outage appeared when thousands of users began reporting issues on the popular outage tracking platform, Down Detector. At its peak, nearly 3,000 reports were logged, indicating a widespread problem affecting Apple Pay, Wallet, Cash, and Card services. Many users also took to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Bluesky to share their frustrations about being unable to complete routine transactions. Apple Pay is not available in India.For nearly two hours, Apple Pay and Wallet remained inaccessible for many, significantly impacting users who rely on the service for daily purchases, transportation, and peer-to-peer payments. This prompted many to seek alternative payment methods, with some noting the inconvenience of being unable to access ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, which often depend on Apple Pay for quick transactions.Apple's official status page, which initially showed all systems as operational, eventually confirmed the widespread disruption. The page listed ongoing issues with Apple Pay, Apple Wallet, Apple Card, and Apple Cash, stating that ""some users may be experiencing issues with this service."" This acknowledgment came roughly an hour after the first reports surfaced, reflecting a delayed response to the problem.By late morning, Apple had updated its status page to indicate that Apple Cash and Apple Card services had returned to normal, while Apple Pay and Wallet continued to experience problems. Despite these updates, some users continued to report lingering issues, suggesting that the recovery process was not uniform across all regions or devices.As of 11:11 a.m. Pacific Time, Apple reported that all affected services, including Apple Pay and Wallet, had been restored. However, the company's status page provided no specific details about the cause of the outage or the steps taken to resolve it. Apple has not yet released an official statement addressing the incident, and requests for comment have so far gone unanswered.While the outage appears to be resolved for most users, some have continued to report sporadic connectivity issues, indicating that the recovery may still be ongoing for a subset of the user base. The incident also sparked renewed discussions online about the importance of having backup payment options, especially as digital payment systems become more deeply integrated into daily life.The timing of the outage, occurring on a Friday morning, likely added to the inconvenience for users attempting to pay bills, transfer funds, or make weekend plans. The incident also highlights the broader implications of relying on digital payment systems, which, while convenient, can leave users vulnerable to sudden disruptions.Given the scale and duration of the outage, Apple Pay's temporary unavailability serves as a reminder of the critical role digital payment platforms now play in global commerce. It also underscores the need for robust backup systems and clear communication from service providers when technical issues arise.","Apple Pay, one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025.

""The issues appear to have been caused by higher traffic than normal on our servers in Virginia, causing temporary service disruptions,"" a TikTok spokesperson said.Users reporting outages were initially concentrated in New York, Washington, D.C., Houston, and Seattle, according to Downdetector data. Some TikTokers reported being able to briefly access the app before it went down again.As of 8 p.m. ET, users were reporting that the app was functioning normally again, though some continued to experience minor issues as services were fully restored.The popular video-sharing platform has an estimated 2 billion users worldwide, with approximately 170 million Americans using the app as of 2024. According to Pew Research, one-third of adults in the U.S. now use TikTok, up from 21 percent in 2021.The outage comes amid ongoing uncertainty about TikTok's future in the United States. In early April, President Donald Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find a U.S. buyer by an additional 75 days to ""ensure all necessary approvals are signed,"" while preventing the app from going dark in America.","TikTok is back online after suffering a major outage on that left thousands of users unable to access the popular video-sharing platform for approximately 4-5 hours.

Obama's daughter accused of copying indie creator's short film: 'I was disappointed and hurt',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/obamas-daughter-accused-of-copying-indie-creators-short-film-i-was-disappointed-and-hurt/articleshow/121241208.cms,"An indie creator accused Malia Obama of stealing her work for a big brand commercial that Malia recently made.

Who is Malia Obama?







Indie filmmaker Natalie Jasmine Harris has accused former president Barack Obama's daughter Malia of copying her short film Grace in her Nike advertisement. Harris said she met Malia at Sundance in 2024 when her 'Grace' and Malia Obama's 'The Heart' were both in competition. Harris made a post on X earlier this month about the shocking similaries and the exact scene which she felt was copied from her film.Harris told Business Insider that two people playing pat-a-cake was the scene that was similar and to this accusation many people told her that she didn't invent pat-a-cake. ""And that's very true. But it's not about the game. It's about the cinematic tools used to depict it,"" Harris said.""Initially, I was disappointed and hurt — not just for myself but for my entire team. I sent the commercial to friends who had the same reaction I did. One put together a shot-by-shot photo comparison,"" she said.""My cinematographer, Tehillah De Castro, noted a lot of similarities from a technical perspective, from the camera angles to the shots to the framing composition and the color palette.""""It speaks to a larger issue of brands not supporting independent artists and opting for folks who already have name recognition, which doesn't breed innovative films or original storytelling. If they wanted these shots that were similar to my shots, why not hire me to direct?""'I was hesitant since it involves former president's daughter'Harris said she would like some acknowledgement from Nike or Malia Obama.""I was initially hesitant to speak out, since it involves a former president's daughter and a beloved brand like Nike...But I've poured too much into my work to just sit by and watch,"" she said.Barack and Michelle's eldest daughter Malia Obama is a writer, director. In 2021, Malia graduated from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. But film was her key interest and she many prestigious internships.

By the time, she ended college, she was fully working in the entertainment industry, In 2023, she doubted as a writer on Donald Glover’s viral Amazon Prime Video limited series “Swarm"".

But his lack of selfcontrol cost him his annual bonus/ NYT (Screengrab)





With a keen sense of smell and legs that seem too short for his body, Fu Zai has won a huge social media audience that has followed him doing official duties since he started as a sniffer dog last fall. He was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.A love of earning treats as rewards has earned Fu Zai strong performance reviews. But it’s also proved a challenge, as his trainer has found that keeping him in line is not easy.Fu Zai was caught on camera recently grabbing a bite of a sausage in a child’s hand during patrol. Officers have since tried to train him to better resist food, but many on social media offered support — and free sausages — for Fu Zai the next time he patrolled the streets. In another video, some of the corgi’s toys and snacks — part of a Lunar New Year “bonus”— were confiscated for sleeping on the job and using his bowl as a urinal. Experts said such behaviour is normal for corgis. “That’s why they’re challenging, too, because they get distracted pretty easily,” said Leonardo Palacio, owner of a training school in Connecticut.Fu Zai is an unusual choice for police work. Traditionally, corgis were bred to work on farms, herding cattle by biting their ankles.In recent times, they have become popular choices for pets, most famously associated with Queen Elizabeth II. But some have retained the propensity to nip. That trait might dissuade trainers when assessing the suitability of a dog for disciplined forces, said a trainer at Hong Kong Canine.Fu Zai’s trainer said he had initially ruled out a corgi as a police dog because of the breed’s reputation. Meeting Fu Zai changed his mind. He later invited Fu Zai to train at the police base. Over the next few months, the corgi excelled in detecting explosives. Moreover, he could fit under tight spaces some other dogs couldn’t reach.Fu Zai became a full-fledged member of Weifang police in Oct. He has since been beamed around the internet as a friendly face for the force, making frequent appearances on its official account on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok. A separate account, named “Fu Zai and his comrades,” has more than 400,000 followers. But the drive for food that helped him land the job also gotten him into some of his troubles. Whether as temptation he can’t resist or a treat used in training, there will probably be more sausage in Fu Zai’s future.","Fu Zai was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Starting April 1, all users logging into the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) system with passwords must use this feature, as per the PFRDA circular dated March 15, 2024.According to ET, using two-factor authentication greatly lowers the risk of unauthorised access to the CRA system . This added layer ensures the safety of NPS transactions and protects the interests of subscribers and stakeholders.The login process for NPS CRAs is changing.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

All about the Tokyo Street Circuit

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend.

Here's everything you need to know about the circuit set in the heart of Japan’s bustling capital.Formula E’s official X account recently shared a graphic video representation of the Tokyo Street Circuit , offering fans a clear glimpse of the track layout to be used for the upcoming races. The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences. The strategically placed Attack Mode activation zone, located just outside Turn 4, adds a critical tactical element to the race.Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix double header: Race favourites, circuit challenges and what to expect Meanwhile, the tight Turns 1 and 2, along with the demanding Turns 10 and 11, are expected to become prime overtaking opportunities.

O.J. Simpson’s mistress took explosive secrets to the grave that could have changed the murder trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/o-j-simpsons-mistress-took-explosive-secrets-to-the-grave-that-could-have-changed-the-murder-trial/articleshow/121234906.cms,"Hidden truths O.J. Simpson's mistress took to the grave could have changed the trial (Getty Images)

The late Tawny Kitaen may have held key information in O.J. Simpson’s murder trial

Missed testimony that might have altered history

Nearly three decades after O.J. Simpson’s high-profile murder trial, new revelations are reigniting debate about the case that captivated the world. Tawny Kitaen, the late actress and 1980s icon, reportedly took to her grave powerful secrets about Simpson’s abusive behavior toward his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson—secrets that some now believe could have significantly impacted the trial’s outcome.Tawny Kitaen passed away in 2021 at the age of 59, never having publicly spoken about her years-long affair with Simpson. Sources now claim she was well aware of the violent abuse Nicole endured during her marriage but chose not to testify or come forward with what she knew.According to an insider, “Tawny knew about the abuse Nicole endured but chose to ignore it and stayed with O.J.” This disturbing claim is made even more unsettling by the fact that Kitaen’s relationship with Simpson overlapped with the period Nicole suffered repeated domestic violence.Nicole’s friend, Faye Resnick, had previously revealed that Nicole once wrote a letter directly to Kitaen, begging her to leave Simpson and warning of his violent tendencies. The letter was a chilling plea from a woman who feared for her life. Nicole allegedly wrote about the physical abuse she had endured and her belief that Simpson would eventually kill her.Yet, despite receiving such a harrowing warning, Kitaen continued her relationship with Simpson. Adding to the complexity, Simpson was also involved with Paula Barbieri during this time, further fueling tensions in Nicole’s life.When Simpson was tried for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in 1995, he denied ever physically abusing his wife. While the prosecution had Nicole’s letter as evidence, it lacked the corroborating testimony that Kitaen could have provided—testimony that might have lent powerful support to Nicole’s claims and offered jurors a fuller picture of Simpson’s violent behavior.Instead, Kitaen remained silent, and Simpson was ultimately acquitted in the criminal trial, though he was later found liable in a civil case.Following the trial, Kitaen’s life spiraled downward, marked by addiction and legal troubles, including a 2002 domestic violence case involving her ex-husband, Chuck Finley. Though the charges were later dropped, sources say she carried deep guilt.“She carried a heavy burden and went to her grave haunted by the choice not to expose O.J.,” one insider shared. Kitaen’s silence now stands as a haunting reminder of how withheld truths can shape justice—or deny it.Also Read: “Bad b***hes every where”: 50 Cent stirs controversy at SI launch with bold comment about Rob Gronkowski and Braxton Berrios’ girlfriends","Tawny Kitaen, the late actress and 1980s icon, may have held key information in O.J.

Gilbert Arenas and his wife Melli Monaco discussed their marriage in a recent conversation

In a refreshingly real conversation, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas and his wife, model and YouTuber Melli Monaco , opened up about their early experiences with marriage. Monaco, who confirmed her surname change to Arenas in the same video on her channel, answered fans’ queries on the insights into their marriage and their honest thoughts on their romantic relationship.Melli Monaco and her husband, an NBA legend, Gilbert Arenas, shared thoughts on their marriage in her recent vlog.For Melli Monaco (Arenas), marriage has been about balance: “I want to say accepting each other for who we are, but also being willing to change and adjust when someone feels uncomfortable,” she said. “It's a little mix, but I really don't think it's hard. I mean, the whole relationship hasn't been hard, so I'm not expecting it to change—hopefully. Fingers crossed.”Gilbert, with a candid smile on his face, admitted he had different expectations going in which were ones shaped by traditional stereotypes. “As a man, I thought I was going to lose my manhood,” he said. “You know, the whole ‘happy wife, happy life’ thing. Like, you're just supposed to do what she says.”But with a laugh, he added, “Nope. I'm not the best, baby,” hinting that their relationship is more collaborative than controlling. When asked if marriage has been better than he expected, Gilbert didn’t hesitate: “So far, yes.”Melli also shared that, for her, the marriage to the three-time NBA All-Star wasn’t shocking. “I felt like what we had before would be the same once we were married. I didn’t expect anything to change,” she said. “We’re just married now. And I told him I changed my name—just not officially yet,” she laughed.Arenas popped the question to Melli Monaco in August 2024. The couple didn’t wait long to make it official, recently tying the knot. Arenas excitedly announced the news on Instagram, sharing several snapshots from their special day.

Carey Price’s wife Angela slams disturbing hate mail sent to their home

Angela Price deals with tick scare after recent trip

In a chilling reminder of the dark side of fame, Carey Price ’s wife, Angela Price , revealed a deeply unsettling experience on Instagram after receiving a four-page hate letter at their family home. The incident has sparked concern not only among fans of the Montreal Canadiens goaltender but also within the broader sports community over the growing invasion of privacy public figures face.Angela took to her Instagram stories to share her shock and frustration, stating that while it’s not unusual for fan mail to reach their house, she usually discards it without reading or showing it to Carey. She emphasized that there are appropriate and respectful avenues to reach out to the former Habs star.“There is an address. You can go to the Montreal Canadiens website and find an address to send fan mail there. And it does get to Carey usually. So you have that,” Angela pointed out.But this recent letter was far from typical fan correspondence. Angela described it as “the first time” they had received targeted hate mail directly at their home. The letter reportedly stemmed from disagreements over political opinions and was deeply personal. Angela was understandably shaken, and didn’t hold back when expressing her disgust.“I mean, send me a nasty message on Instagram. Be a normal person. Go to TikTok and talk crap. But sending something to someone's address where you shouldn't have their home address is wildly inappropriate. F**king creepy. Don't be a creep,” she said.In a separate, unrelated scare, Angela also shared a recent health concern involving a tick bite following a hiking and wine-tasting trip in Tickton. After returning home, she noticed something on her neck during a work meeting. She reached out to her group of friends, and one of them quickly helped her remove the tick.“I emailed the group of girls I was on the trip with and they jumped into action like of course a bunch of moms was gonna handle it,” she said. Fortunately, the tick hadn’t latched on for long and wasn’t engorged.Also Read: “A dirt bag”: Fans call for suspension as Jamie Benn fined for controversial cheap shot on Mark Scheifele in Game 5 While Angela handled both incidents with grace and humor, the hate mail incident underscores a serious issue: public figures, especially their families, deserve boundaries and respect.",Carey Price’s wife Angela recently received a four-page hate letter at their home.
