Matt Stafford and wife Kelly embrace Halloween as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce



Kelly Stafford , the wife of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, recently revealed a surprising admission. She confessed to feeling a tinge of envy over the media frenzy surrounding Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce last fall. On a recent podcast episode, she explained how the NFL's excessive focus on the celebrity couple had overshadowed the dedication and hard work of many NFL players. However, Stafford clarified that her issue wasn't with Swift herself but rather with the NFL's decision to prioritize the couple's relationship over the league's athletes. Despite her initial feelings, the Staffords embraced the Swift-Kelce phenomenon in a hilarious way.Also Read: Travis & Jason Kelce join hands with Boyz II Men for the new holiday single ""Christmas Time (in Cleveland Heights)"" Kelly Stafford candidly acknowledged her growing “tired” of the extensive NFL focus on Swift and Kelce during the football season. Speaking on The Morning After podcast, she admitted a hint of jealousy sparked her recent comment about the NFL’s Swift-Kelce fixation, joking that she didn’t want “another four months” of this media coverage. Stafford noted that while Swift and Kelce make an iconic celebrity couple, the NFL’s concentrated spotlight on them at times seemed to overshadow the hard work and dedication of the players on the field. “It’s not Taylor’s fault,” Stafford clarified, pointing out that it was the league’s choice to shine such an intense light on the couple’s budding romance, rather than on the players’ efforts.In the spirit of Halloween, however, Kelly showed she could also enjoy the Swift-Kelce frenzy. Just a day after her podcast aired, the Staffords fully embraced the theme by dressing up as the famous duo with their kids. Kelly shared a family snapshot on Instagram, captioning it “Six Swifties & a stubborn stache,” a humorous nod to Kelce’s distinctive mustache.Kelly and Matthew recreated Swift and Kelce’s notable U.S. Open appearance, with Kelly channeling the pop star’s signature look. She wore a red-and-white gingham sundress paired with sunglasses and Swift’s iconic red lipstick. To top it off, she even donned a blonde wig with side-swept bangs, going the extra mile by enlisting a friend to help cut her bangs to match Swift’s hairstyle. Meanwhile, Matthew sported Kelce’s cream-colored outfit with a Gucci bucket hat, capturing the football star’s laid-back style.Their four daughters, twins Sawyer and Chandler, Hunter, and Tyler, each wore sparkly “Eras Tour” outfits in a nod to Swift’s music era-inspired wardrobe, making for a playful and memorable family look. The family’s Halloween costumes quickly garnered attention on social media, where fans enjoyed the clever mix of pop culture and NFL themes.Kelly Stafford’s Halloween tribute captured her good-humored approach, bridging her critique with a dose of fun. Her lighthearted take demonstrated that, even amidst the media frenzy, she could still have a little fun with the “Swift-Kelce effect” on the NFL.Also Read: ""We turn the page and get ready for this game"": After heartbreaking Hail Mary loss, Bears committed to finding ways to overcome","Kelly Stafford admitted to feeling a tinge of envy over the media frenzy surrounding Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce last fall.

A strange “alien-like” sea creature washed ashore on Horseshoe Bay in Port Elliott , South Australia, leaving locals astonished and creating widespread curiosity among netizens.Vicki Evans, a beachcomber, encountered the creature while walking along the shore and captured photos that she shared on a community Facebook page.“Over 26 years walking Horseshoe Bay – I’ve never seen anything quite like this before!” Evans wrote, describing her shock at the sight. The photo quickly caught attention, with users expressing amazement at the odd find, calling it the “freakiest thing” they’d ever seen and speculating wildly about its origins.The creature appeared to be around three meters long, featuring translucent stalks covered in vermicelli-like tendrils and bead-like shells that dangled off the ends like seaweed.Many commenters described it as looking almost alien or like something out of science fiction, while some wondered if it was a rare form of jellyfish or an unknown deep-sea species . One Facebook user commented, “Wow, it looks long judging by the scale of the dog,” referencing Evans’s dog, which appeared in the photo for comparison.As per the New York Post, Marine ecologist Dr Zoe Doubleday from the University of South Australiawas soon able to solve the mystery, identifying the “alien” as a large colony of goose barnacles , a species of communal crustacean.Goose barnacles typically attach themselves to floating objects, ship hulls, and wharves.Dr Doubleday speculated that this colony had broken off from its original anchor point, which she called the “mothership,” and drifted to shore in a rare display. She remarked that while goose barnacles are common in Australian waters, it is unusual to see such a large intact cluster.Goose barnacles, scientifically known as ‘ Lepas anatifera ’, are a delicacy in certain parts of Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal, where they are known as ‘Percebes’.They are often served at upscale restaurants and can command prices as high as $125 per pound.","A strange “alien-like” sea creature washed ashore on Horseshoe Bay in Port Elliott, South Australia.

Driverless and flying cars, super-intelligent sentient AI, cyborgs , augmented reality, smart cities : where are they? The Long History of the Future: Why Tomorrow’s Technology Still Isn’t Here by Nicole Kobie tells us why many of these visions have only just shimmered over the horizon.A few more years, the companies and researchers and marketers always say, but things that work in the lab are not easily brought into the real world. The first flying car was approved by regulators in 1956, but here we are, still stuck on the road. Hyperloops require route-length concrete tubes propped up on towers in the sky – as technically infeasible as the hovering trains once imagined too. Impressive as today’s AI applications are, we don’t have artificial general intelligence, the ability to make a machine think.It took a century’s worth of patient effort and computing advances to set off a cascade of inventions: driverless cars depend on satellite navigation, neural networks needed GPUs, wearable computers needed lithium batteries and so on.In 1994, a German student was able to pick up people from the airport in a car that he handed over to a computer to drive, safely changing lanes and overtaking others. And yet, it’s one thing to drive on a highway, another to deal with streets of pedestrians, pets, safety cones and other confusions.Automation in cars has been conceived at several levels – from the basic cruise control of many modern cars to San Francisco’s driverless Waymo or Cruise cars that can manage an entire journey in controlled stretches. But the car that needs no human support remains mythical. And yet, the book shows, some of these discarded dreams like the ‘electronic highway’ with charging cables, could have taken the world in a different direction.Robots, of course, have been around us for decades – assisting surgery, cleaning floors, dominating production lines. They just don’t look the way we imagined. From clunky Eric in the 1930s to Optimus and Walker, humanoid robots are mainly meant for entertainment or research. Retail, logistics and security use automation – it makes sense to combine human decision-making with robot bodies in high-risk operations. Same with cyborgs: while bionic humans don’t exist, and brain-tech melds are still in hype territory, cochlear implants and pacemakers have helped many lives.Meanwhile, smart cities have been planned everywhere from South Korea to Saudi Arabia to Andhra Pradesh but none have materialised, because cities are not made topdown by fantasist master-planners. At the moment, they offer little but efficient surveillance.Who builds the future, and who decides what gets built, the book asks. Many of these dreams emerged out of military investment , directly or indirectly. Corporations in Silicon Valley, driven only by their shareholders, took charge of the tech future, and are now followed closely by Chinese innovation.Obviously, the more diverse the dreamers and doers are, the more likely we are to have tech that solves real-world needs. Today’s billionaires want to colonise space or create fabulous cities on oceans and deserts – to fly over traffic rather than address traffic as a civic challenge. Not every human problem can be engineered out of existence, the book reminds us. But the pursuit is valuable, and it leads to random successes that could not have been imagined at the start.",The Long History of the Future: Why Tomorrow’s Technology Still Isn’t Here by Nicole Kobie tells us why many of these visions have only just shimmered over the horizon.

Northern Ireland is ready to embrace autumn as the clocks will change next weekend, marking the end of British Summer Time . At 02:00 BST on 27 October, clocks will move back one hour, allowing people an extra hour of sleep.The change marks the beginning of shorter days and longer nights , leading up to winter solstice on 21 December, which is the shortest day of the year.This practice of changing clocks has been followed for over a century to make better use of daylight during the winter months. Shifting an hour of sunlight to the morning aims to provide brighter mornings during the darker season. However, even though people gain an extra hour of sleep, this change can disrupt sleep patterns .Autumn weather is already evident across Northern Ireland, with cooler temperatures ranging between 10°C and 14°C and frequent rain showers. October often brings more cloudy skies, frosty mornings, and occasional storms from the Atlantic.The clock change will make mornings slightly brighter, but sunsets will be earlier, making evenings feel longer.This transition period advises people to prepare for the colder months ahead.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","Clocks will move back one hour on 27 October, marking the end of British Summer Time.

JD Vance: Joe Rogan podcast: Why JD Vance loves matar paneer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-rogan-podcast-why-jd-vance-loves-matar-paneer/articleshow/114852081.cms,"JD Vance:

Joe Rogan:

One of the more surreal moments of this election has been JD Vance and Joe Rogan discussing "" matar paneer "". The conversation went:I don't—you know, I still, like, I'm kind of one of these people where if I don't have a piece of meat, it's not a complete meal. But if you're any vegetarian, eat paneer and rice and delicious chickpeas. Do not eat this disgusting fake meat.I'm just very skeptical when someone is promoting things for either global health or for the environment. And then I find out that they have a ton of money invested in companies that could fit those needs. It's a real problem, this philanthro-capitalism thing.Joe Rogan went off on a tangent about the “fake food” industry, particularly plant-based meats. He expressed his distaste, calling it “highly processed garbage” and stating, “If you want to be a vegetarian, eat proper vegetables—have Indian food, for instance, which has fantastic vegetarian dishes .”JD Vance chimed in, pointing out that as he's married to an Indian-American, he’s experienced firsthand the depth of flavour inIndian vegetarian food . Rogan agreed, highlighting how Indian cuisine delivers vegetarian dishes that are genuinely vegetable-based and don’t try to mimic meat.Vance then shared a story from when he first started dating his wife, confessing that he hadn’t known much about vegetarian cooking at the time. “Being a meat-and-potatoes guy from Ohio, I was clueless about what vegetarians ate,” he admitted. He recounted his attempt to impress her by making “vegetarian pizza” using a base of crescent roll dough topped with raw broccoli and a sprinkling of ranch dressing before baking it for an excessive 45 minutes. Vance laughed about the culinary disaster, admitting it was far from his finest creation.Reflecting on his improved appreciation for vegetarian cuisine, Vance noted that, while he still favours meat with meals, he’s come to recognise the quality of authentic vegetarian dishes. “If you’re going vegetarian, have paneer, rice, and chickpeas—not this artificial ‘meat’,” he concluded. Anthony Bourdain , celebrated chef and world traveller, had also sung the praises of Indian vegetarian food. He appreciated it for being vibrant, varied, and deeply flavourful—showing the world that vegetarianism could be a culinary delight, far from bland or boring. Bourdain remarked that Indian food was among the best vegetarian cuisine globally, crafted with fresh, wholesome ingredients that focus on elevating vegetables rather than trying to make them taste like something else.Choosing authentic Indian vegetarian food over processed plant-based meat offers a wealth of benefits.Indian vegetarian dishes are typically based on whole ingredients like lentils, chickpeas, vegetables, and spices. These meals deliver a balanced mix of nutrients naturally, rich in fibre, vitamins, and protein, especially with staples like dal, chole, and paneer. Unlike heavily processed plant-based meats, Indian food’s focus on fresh, real vegetables and pulses means you avoid the artificial additives, preservatives, and processing that often accompany fake meat products. Not only does this make Indian cuisine more nourishing, but it’s also closer to nature and aligns with cultural traditions that have celebrated plant-based diets for centuries, making it both a healthful and satisfying choice.","JD Vance and Joe Rogan were talking about the fake food industry.

Joe Rogan: ""

JD Vance: ""

In a recent episode of "" The Joe Rogan Experience ,"" JD Vance brought both sharp political insight and laugh-out-loud moments, delivering a uniquely humorous take on his experiences as a Republican senator and Vice President candidate. The conversation ranged widely, from the challenges of parenting in the spotlight—like his son's public outbursts of profanity—to an unlikely affinity for Hunter Biden , whom Vance humorously dubbed ""Hunter S. Thompson without the writing talent."" Rogan and Vance’s shared scepticism of mainstream trends, from artificial meat to ""woke"" ideologies, set the stage for Vance's cutting quips about the profit-driven motives behind everything from gender debates to environmental policies.Rogan leaned into his comedic side, riffing on Bill Gates ' health advice, Zuckerberg 's martial arts phase, and even Trump ’s uncanny ability to defy presidential aging. The laughs continued with tales of Vance's disastrous "" vegetarian pizza "" and Rogan's own parenting stumbles, balancing their critique of today’s political scene with a refreshing dose of humour. This episode captured the kind of off-the-cuff irreverence that Rogan fans love, punctuated by Vance’s frank and often unexpected reflections on life in the public eye.JD Vance: ""So Trump’s like, 'J.D., you missed a very important call. I’ll have to pick someone else.' I’m about to sh*t a brick…then he says, 'Nah, kidding, I want you.' Meanwhile, my kid’s still talking Pokémon.""Joe Rogan: ""Funniest thing ever—Elon posted Bill Gates next to the pregnant man emoji, saying, 'If you want to lose a boner real quick…'""JD Vance: ""Elon is funny as sh*t, man.""JD Vance: ""I'd say I wanna go I want one of those guys they're having I wanna hang out with those guys okay by the way this is my you know an act of bipartisanship the one thing that republicans man that were really I think we got really wrong in the last few years is the anti-Hunter Biden stuff I wanna go hang out with Hunter Biden I mean I may be the only republican that dude that dude he was like Hunter S. Thompson without the writing talent that guy went hard you gotta give it to him I would bet a hundred dollars that Hunter Biden is voting for Donald Trump for president well it doesn't seem like he likes.""JD Vance (imitating Kamala): ""We need to build an opportunity economy because if Americans don't have opportunity then they wont have the opportunity to be Americans. Kamala is the Michael Jordan of using as many words as possible to say as little as possible. There's a certain gift she has. Kamala doesn't have an ounce of curiosity about public policy in this country. That's what scares the hell out of me""JD Vance: ""First meal I made for my wife was ‘vegetarian pizza’—crescent rolls, raw broccoli, ranch dressing. She’s a saint for staying with me.""Joe Rogan: ""Who’s telling Bill to eat that fake meat? Look at him!""JD Vance: ""He’s aging harder than Trump. Whatever you’re doing, go see a doctor, Bill.""Joe Rogan: ""My kid, when she was two, just goes, 'Sh*t.' My wife was mortified, but come on—adorable!""JD Vance: ""My kid dropped a Biscoff cookie on a plane and goes, ‘Dad, what the f*ck?’ Suddenly, everyone knew I was Senator Vance.""Joe Rogan: ""Zuckerberg’s into jiu-jitsu now…like, is hard work making people conservative?""JD Vance: ""Maybe the Dems want everyone unhealthy—easier to turn them liberal.""Joe Rogan: ""Presidents age like they’re getting radiation.

Easiest route: declare them non-binary.""JD Vance: ""If you’re going vegetarian, eat Indian food. Don’t eat that sad fake cheeseburger.""Joe Rogan: ""So now not eating chemicals is right-wing. Fitness, too. It’s bananas.""JD Vance: ""Marc Andreessen says woke-ism is a cult.

When I first started dating my wife, I just had no idea, like, what vegetarians ate.I'm like a meat and potatoes guy from Ohio. And I wanted to make her dinner, and I wanted to really impress her because I was, like, madly in love with her.""Did you cook beef?""No. The meal that I made her—I'm not proud of this, but I'll tell you—was, you know what crescent rolls are? Those, like, Pillsbury yeast rolls. So I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes. That was it? And that was disgusting. And that was my vegetarian pizza that I made.""",JD Vance is a Republican senator and Vice President candidate.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel. As to how this Apple planning to buy Intel rumour started? They come from the tech YouTube channel 'Moore's Law is Dead', where Tom S. reported ""whispers"" of a potential purchase of Intel by Apple. He, at the same time, also claimed that Samsung too is interested in acquiring or merging with the chip manufacturer Intel.While this idea may seem utterly absurd to many, it would certainly be a dramatic twist in the long-running saga of the PC industry.Back in 2019, Apple did acquire Intel's modem division, but this new rumour proposes a full-scale takeover of the entire chipmaker. While Samsung is also mentioned as a potential buyer, it's Apple's involvement that piques the most interest, and perhaps a touch of amusement.Once a dominant force in the PC industry, Intel's fortunes have waned in recent years. The company has faced numerous challenges, from manufacturing delays to declining market share. Despite repeated promises of groundbreaking new processors, Intel has struggled to regain its former glory.Meanwhile, Apple has successfully transitioned away from Intel's chips, developing its own powerful Apple Silicon processors. These chips have consistently outperformed Intel's offerings, solidifying Apple's position in the tech industry. If Apple acquires Intel, the iPhone maker could free itself from an overreliance on TSMC for chips.Also, please note that the Youtuber Tom reiterates several times in the video that these are all rumours, and it's not clear if any purchase of Intel is actually in the works.","A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel.

Enhanced exploration and discovery with Gemini

Updates to navigation features

Immersive View expands to more cities

Google Maps has reached a new milestone and is getting three major updates, including the ones powered by its AI model Gemini. According to the company, Maps is now used by over 2 billion people monthly. Google CEO Sundar Pichai shared a post on X sharing the latest information.“Exciting week for @GoogleMaps. Hit the 2B monthly user mark, and now you can ask Maps more complex questions, thanks to Gemini’s creation, reasoning + summarization capabilities, grounded in our knowledge of 250M+ places around the world,” he said in a post on X“By using AI to analyse billions of images, alongside data from local partners and our community, we’re able to make over 100 million updates to the map every single day. So whether you’re travelling the world or across town, you’re seeing the most up-to-date information possible,” Google Maps said.Google has also announced that it is integrating its powerful Gemini AI models into Maps, enabling users to get more personalised recommendations, explore routes in greater detail, and receive answers to complex questions about their surroundings.With Gemini, users can now ask Maps open-ended questions like “things to do with friends at night” and receive curated recommendations tailored to their preferences. The AI can also summarise reviews, providing quick insights into what others like about a place.Additionally, users can ask detailed questions about specific locations, such as whether they offer outdoor seating or have a quiet atmosphere, and receive instant answers. Google says that these capabilities are powered by Gemini's advanced abilities combined with Google's database of over 250 million places and insights from the Maps community.These features start rolling out in the US on Android and iOS this week, and similar experiences are coming in the coming months on Search.Google Maps is also introducing a major update to its navigation features, aimed at making driving easier and more intuitive. Users can now explore points of interest along their route before starting their journey, including landmarks, attractions and dining options.Another feature that aims to enhance navigation is the information about clearer visuals of lanes, crosswalks, and road signs. This will help drivers anticipate upcoming manoeuvres or turns and avoid last-minute lane changes that usually cause jams. The update also includes the ability to see and report weather-related disruptions, such as flooded roads or low visibility conditions.Thirdly, arrival guidance has also been improved, with features like highlighted parking lots, parking reminders and walking directions from the car to the final destination. Users can even access Street View or AR walking navigation to quickly orient themselves upon arrival.These features will start rolling out globally on Android and iOS this week. Enhanced navigation starts rolling out next month on Android and iOS in over 30 metro areas.Immersive View, which provides AI-powered 3D visualisations of places and routes, is expanding to 150 cities globally. New categories of places, such as college campuses, are also being added, offering users a unique way to explore and experience locations virtually.","Google says Maps is now used by over 2 billion people monthly.

Apple promises $1.1 billion to expand this iPhone emergency feature,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-promises-1-1-billion-to-expand-this-iphone-emergency-feature/articleshow/114852347.cms,"Apple’s Emergency SOS via Satellite on iPhones: What we know so far



Satellite services provider, GlobalStar has announced that iPhone maker Apple has promised to invest an additional $1.1 billion in upfront infrastructure prepayments to expand its satellite capabilities. In a filing, (seen by StreetInsider.com) the company also noted that Apple will also acquire a 20% ownership stake in Globalstar for nearly $400 million. This news has sent Globalstar's stock price soaring and suggests that Apple has ambitious plans for its iPhone satellite features. Currently, iPhone users can send text messages over satellite when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi range, a feature introduced with iOS 18 .While Apple currently offers this feature for free, the company has indicated that it may eventually charge users for satellite services. The emergency feature is currently available in the US as well as a few other markets and is excepted to debut soon in India and more countries . This investment in Globalstar's infrastructure underscores Apple's commitment to expanding this feature to other countries as well as enhancing its satellite offerings for iPhone users.This feature allows users to contact emergency services and share their location via satellite when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi range. Initially launched with the iPhone 14 in 2022, the Emergency SOS feature was supposed to become a paid service in late 2024. However, Apple has extended its free satellite connectivity service for iPhones until 2025.While Apple has not yet revealed how much it will charge for satellite services, there is speculation that it may continue to offer Emergency SOS for free while charging for other features, such as location sharing in Find My or recreational texting. Other possibilities include bundling satellite service with Apple One or offering it as a mobile carrier add-on .Despite the uncertainty surrounding the feature’s pricing, users with an iPhone 14 or later can currently try out the satellite feature in demo mode by navigating to Settings -> Emergency SOS -> Emergency SOS via Satellite -> Try Demo.","Satellite services provider, GlobalStar has announced that iPhone maker Apple has promised to invest an additional $1.1 billion in upfront infrastructure prepayments to expand its satellite capabilities.

Microsoft delays Windows’ controversial 'Recall' feature for third time this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-delays-windows-controversial-recall-feature-for-third-time-this-year/articleshow/114845243.cms,"Microsoft has once again postponed the rollout of its AI-powered Recall feature for Copilot Plus PCs, pushing the launch from October to December, the company announced Tuesday.According to The Verge, Microsoft senior product manager Brandon LeBlanc said the delay would allow the company to ""deliver a secure and trusted experience"" and refine the feature before previewing it with Windows Insiders .This marks the third delay for Recall, which was originally scheduled to debut in June. The feature is designed to automatically capture screenshots of users' PC activities and allow them to search through their computer history using natural language queries.The repeated delays stem from significant privacy and security concerns raised when Microsoft first unveiled Recall in May. The feature initially stored user data in an unencrypted database and activated automatically without user consent .In response to the backlash, Microsoft has implemented several changes. The Verge reports that Recall will now be completely optional, requiring users to explicitly opt in. The company has also added encryption to the screenshot database and mandated Windows Hello authentication for accessing stored data.Users will have the ability to fully uninstall the feature and exclude specific applications, websites, and private browsing sessions from being captured. Microsoft is also implementing anti-malware protections, including rate-limiting measures to prevent abuse.Despite these modifications, questions remain about user interest in the feature when it eventually launches. The multiple delays and initial privacy concerns have dampened enthusiasm for what Microsoft had intended to be a flagship AI capability for its Copilot Plus PCs.Microsoft has committed to launching Recall for Windows Insiders by December, though given the feature's troubled history, further delays remain possible.","Microsoft has pushed back the launch of its Recall feature for Copilot Plus PCs.
