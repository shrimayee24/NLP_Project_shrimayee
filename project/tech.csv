Investigators: 80 CCTV dashboards compromised

AHMEDABAD: A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare. What began at Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot as a case of careless digital housekeeping spiralled into one of India's most disturbing cyber scandals. Hackers breached the hospital's CCTV system through its default admin login, stole hours of intimate footage of women being examined in the gynaecology ward, and fed it into an international porn fetish network for profit.The access logs spanned nearly a year, from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024, until the perpetrators were arrested this Feb. The hackers were able to steal at least 50,000 clips over nine months from across the country.The scam came to light after teaser clips from the Rajkot facility were posted online on YouTube channels like ""Megha Mbbs"" and ""cp monda"". Customers were led to Telegram groups to buy the footage, for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000. Investigators found about ""80 CCTV dashboards compromised nationwide, including in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, and Delhi"". The victims ranged across 20 states, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate houses, cinema halls, factories, and even private residences.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ""admin123"".An Ahmedabad cybercrime branch officer told TOI: ""The primary method used was a 'brute force attack' (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).""Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this. With stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya - who was later arrested in Delhi and used a diploma in medical laboratory technology as a cover - used a tool meant for legitimate remote viewing to input stolen login details and gain unauthorised access to the hospital's cameras.","A single default password - ""admin123"" - was all it took to unlock a national nightmare.

If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it’s totally the wrong question.”

“The Coming Wave”

“We must build AI for people, not to be a person.”

What Mustafa Suleyman said about AI having emotions





“Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn’t feel sad when it experiences ‘pain.’ It’s a very, very important distinction. It’s really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it’s actually experiencing.”

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

“The reason we give people rights today is because we don’t want to harm them, because they suffer.

They have a pain network, and they have preferences which involve avoiding pain. These models don’t have that. It’s just a simulation.”

“They’re not conscious. So it would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they’re not and they can’t be,”

""not a super useful term""

""for more and more things.""





Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness. He said this, asserting that only biological beings possess this trait and noted that the pursuit is misplaced. In a recent interview with CNBC at the AfroTech Conference, Suleyman said,Suleyman has been a vocal opponent of the prospect of conscious AI, or AI services that could convince humans they are capable of suffering.In 2023, Suleyman co-authored the bookand penned an essay titled,His comments come as the generative AI market, led by companies like OpenAI, pushes toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, the AI companion market is growing with products from companies including Meta and Elon Musk’s xAI.Highlighting the difference between AI becoming more capable and the idea of it having emotions, Suleyman said:Referring to the theory of biological naturalism, which suggests that consciousness depends on the processes of a living brain, Suleyman explained:Suleyman also highlighted that the science of detecting consciousness is still in its early stages. While he acknowledged that different organisations may have their own research goals, he strongly opposed studying AI consciousness.he added.In August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that AGI isand that what's actually happening is models are advancing quickly and that we'll rely on themMeanwhile, for Suleyman, it's particularly important to draw a clear contrast between AI getting smarter and more capable versus its ability to ever have human emotions.","Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness.

The announcement and immediate action

Your responsibility

The takeaway





The days of waking up and frantically checking local news for a last-minute school cancellation are officially over. The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year, establishing clear, scientific benchmarks for when in-person studies must be suspended. This decisive policy removes all guesswork, ensuring that the health and safety of every student and teacher are prioritized the moment weather conditions become dangerous. Crucially, the order confirms that suspension (تعليق الدراسة) does not mean a holiday; it means an immediate, seamless pivot to remote learning, guaranteeing the educational process remains continuous.The Ministry of Education (and regional education directorates) set clear, limited situations when in-person schooling may be suspended. These decisions are not ad-hoc: they follow coordination with the National Meteorological Authority (or regional weather services) and Civil Defence, and they focus on actual risks to students’ and staff’s safety for example heavy rain/flooding, severe sandstorms, major infectious outbreaks, or national events that disrupt normal travel. Announcements are only official when released by the Ministry or the local education office.In a significant upgrade from previous policies, the Ministry now relies on specific, quantifiable metrics before authorizing a change in attendance. Regional education departments are expected to coordinate with weather services, automatically triggering a switch to remote learning when any of these nine conditions are met:While the new policy addresses unexpected weather disruptions, the Ministry has also confirmed the foundational academic schedule for the current year. Students should keep these dates locked in as they prepare for the first semester's official examinations:The seamless shift to remote learning, enabled by this new ministerial order, means that even severe weather events will not compromise the integrity or timing of these critical academic milestones.The notification process is designed to be fast and authoritative: The official announcement will come directly from the regional directorates of the Ministry of Education, often in coordination with the local Civil Defense authorities who monitor the weather. News is typically shared via official social media channels (like X/Twitter) and through local news outlets. Parents and students should also rely on official announcements from their individual schools. Once the suspension is announced, the school day is not cancelled; it is immediately converted into a remote learning day.Students are expected to be ready to transition instantly to digital learning to prevent any interruption in their studies. Students must immediately log onto their designated online learning platforms, such as Madrasati (مدرستي) or other approved digital tools used by their school. Just like in-person attendance, logging into the remote classes is mandatory. Teachers will take attendance, and students must follow the regular class schedule from home. The goal is to keep education flowing while ensuring safety. Students should treat the remote day with the same seriousness as a physical school day.This official ministerial order guarantees two things for the 1447 school year: students' safety is now backed by clear scientific data, and their education will never be truly interrupted. By standardizing these rules, Saudi Arabia has built a more stable and responsive system, ensuring that learning continues, rain or shine.","The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year.

Deshae Frost fights back with explosive rant following Asmongold’s photoshopping accusations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/deshae-frost-fights-back-with-explosive-rant-following-asmongolds-photoshopping-accusations/articleshow/125090959.cms,"Asmongold and Deshae Frost (Image via Asmongold TV| YouTube & Getty Images)





Did Deshae Frost Photoshop his revenue? His unexpected response to Asmongold sparks debate





In a dramatic turn for the streaming community, popular creator Deshae Frost has finally responded after fellow streamer Asmongold accused him of photoshopping his revenue figures. Frost had publicly claimed to have earned roughly $300,000 in one month on Twitch, streaming for over 235 hours during the period. Asmongold called his screenshot into question, highlighting odd font‑consistencies and pointing out possible edits.Denying this, Frost now insists the numbers are real, backing them with context on his subscriber and view surge, inviting any platform or third‑party audit to verify legitimacy. His response shifts the focus from mere accusation to transparency in creator earnings, raising broader questions about how streamers disclose revenue and how their evidence is presented and verified in the digital age.Deshae Frost’s comeback emphasizes several key points: firstly, that his reported revenue covers a specific timeframe (October 1 to November 2, 2025) and is backed by analytics showing a peak concurrency of 17,853 viewers and 54,203 new followers.He acknowledges the unusual ratio of 8,250 subscriptions yet maintains that high ad revenue and tipping played a major role, rather than just subscription numbers, to reach the $300K figure.Frost further challenged critics to examine raw dashboards, encouraged independent verification, and reiterated his intention to be “fully transparent.”This back‑and‑forth brings to light key issues for the streaming ecosystem: how creators present financial claims, the community’s role in questioning legitimacy, and how platforms like Twitch might better support verifiable disclosures.For viewers and sponsors alike, the Frost‑ Asmongold flap serves as a reminder: when a number is put forward, the narrative and the proof matter just as much.Also read: How much money is Asmongold making from Kick?

What does Cloud Miner offer?

Step-by-step: Subscribing to Cloud Miner

Step 1: Get Ready to Bid the initial contracts are made available through an online auction hosted at the designated platform. You must be a UAE resident with a verified ID to participate.

Step 2: Participate in the Auction Bidding for the limited-capacity 24-month contracts runs for a specified period (The initial window was November 3 to 9). You will need to secure a contract through this process to gain access to the service.

Step 3: Account Verification (KYC/AML) To ensure regulatory compliance and security, du requires a strict verification process for all high-value transactions:

UAE Pass: Access to the platform requires verification through your official UAE Pass digital identity. This ensures adherence to local Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Mandatory 2FA is required for all account access, bolstering your security.

Step 4: Commence Mining Once your subscription is secured, your account is verified, and the fixed fees are paid, your cloud mining operation begins immediately from du's secure data centers in the UAE. You receive Bitcoin rewards based on the rented computational power.

What residents should weigh before signing up?

Costs vs rewards: Cloud mining reduces setup costs but fees, uptime, and pool efficiency affect returns read the fee and payout formulas closely.



Payout mechanics: Payouts are reported to be in Bitcoin and routed to users’ wallets ensure you have a compatible wallet and understand tax/reporting requirements in your emirate.

Contract terms & refunds: Check contract length, maintenance fees, and what happens if network difficulty rises or BTC price changes.

Security & trust: Using a large incumbent (du) gives more operational transparency than anonymous cloud-mining sites, but always verify service terms and regulatory disclosures.

Want to mine Bitcoin without the drama of hardware, heat or high bills? UAE residents can now click, subscribe and start earning BTC - no tech skills needed. Du 's new Cloud Miner service, the UAE's first official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a telecom company, has made Bitcoin mining accessible and compliant for residents.This guide breaks down exactly what the service is, how to get started, and the key benefits of this regulated opportunity.MaaS stands for Mining as a Service. It's a business model that dramatically simplifies the process of cryptocurrency mining, particularly for digital assets like Bitcoin.In a MaaS model, a provider (like Du, with its Cloud Miner) owns and operates all the necessary, specialized mining hardware. They maintain the equipment, manage the high electricity consumption, and ensure the entire operation remains compliant and connected to the blockchain. Essentially, Cloud Miner allows UAE residents to participate in Bitcoin mining by simply subscribing to the output of a professional mining operation, making it an easy-to-digest investment product rather than a technical endeavor.The digital finance landscape in the UAE just got a major upgrade.Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner, offering residents a straightforward way to participate in the booming world of Bitcoin mining. Revealed on November 2, 2025, during a high-profile launch event at the Burj Khalifa, this service marks a massive first: it is the initial official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a UAE company.Cloud Miner is a “mining-as-a-service” product under du’s du Tech arm. Each contract sells a fixed amount of hashing power (plans start at 250 terahashes per second (TH/s)), and the mining results are paid out directly in Bitcoin to users’ crypto wallets. du runs the hardware, handles electricity and technical management, and shares the mined Bitcoin with subscribers according to the capacity they hold. This removes the need for users to buy ASIC rigs, arrange power, or manage complex cooling and maintenance.This move is exclusive to UAE residents and instantly expands the digital options available to those looking to grow their investment portfolio within a fully transparent and locally compliant framework. It aligns perfectly with the country’s push to develop robust digital asset and blockchain infrastructure.The initial phase of securing a Cloud Miner contract is done through a specific online process, designed for UAE residents only.A mainstream telecom company offering cloud mining services lowers the entry barrier for ordinary UAE residents and signals the UAE’s continued push to integrate digital-asset services into mainstream infrastructure, while also highlighting the need to strictly follow local rules about where mining can physically operate.","Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner.

Two-Dose Shingrix schedule and coverage

Abu Dhabi Citizens: Eligible citizens holding a Thiqa card can receive the vaccine free of charge at authorized healthcare facilities.

Insured Residents: While not fully subsidized in all emirates, leading health insurers like Daman have recently expanded their coverage to include the Shingrix vaccine under their DHA Compliant Enhanced schemes, making it more accessible to residents with premium policies.





If you’re 50 or older in the UAE, there’s a new health reminder to add to your checklist: the shingles vaccine is now available to help protect you from the painful rash and nerve-related complications caused when the chickenpox virus resurfaces later in life.In a major step to strengthen public health, the UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) officially announced the inclusion of the Herpes Zoster vaccine—known commercially as Shingrix—into the national adult vaccination programme. This initiative ensures protection against the highly painful viral infection known as Shingles. The vaccine is now easily accessible at health facilities across all seven emirates. The primary target group for this vital preventive measure includes all UAE residents aged 50 years and older. However, those aged 18 and above who have a weakened immune system due to medical conditions or therapy are also strongly advised to get vaccinated, reflecting a robust, proactive approach to health.Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the very same virus responsible for chickenpox.After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant within the nerve tissue and can reactivate years later, often as the immune system naturally weakens with age. The condition typically manifests as a painful skin rash and blisters that emerge on one side of the body. The pain is often described as burning or stabbing. Crucially, Shingles can lead to severe, long-lasting complications, most notably Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a form of chronic nerve pain that can persist for months or even years after the rash has cleared, significantly impacting the quality of life. The vaccine is recommended even for individuals who have previously experienced a Shingles outbreak.The Shingrix vaccine is administered as a two-dose series, maximizing its effectiveness. The second dose is typically scheduled to be received two to six months after the first. Health officials are dedicated to raising public awareness about the importance of adhering to this full two-dose schedule for maximum protection.Regarding cost, coverage varies by emirate and policy:The UAE’s nationwide shingles vaccination rollout reinforces the growing importance of adult immunisation as a core pillar of long-term public health. By proactively prioritising prevention for those most at risk, the country aims to significantly reduce severe cases and improve the overall quality of life for older adults. Individuals aged 50 and above are strongly encouraged to consult their healthcare provider and take timely vaccination to ensure complete and sustained protection.","UAE launches national adult vaccination drive for ages 50+.

Strengthening Dubai’s parking infrastructure









As Dubai’s commercial districts continue to expand, its streets are adapting. Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October. Clearly marked T-code areas now provide structured parking for workers, residents, and visitors in two of the city’s busiest business hubs.Parkin confirmed the introduction of two new paid parking zones under the T-code system — Zone Code 675T in Dubai Studio City and Zone Code 812T in Dubai Outsource City. Clear signboards have been installed throughout both locations to identify the designated areas.Paid parking operates daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the following tariff structure:These rates align with Parkin’s broader T-code pricing framework applied in several of Dubai’s newly developed areas.Residents and professionals working in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City can also access Parkin’s subscription plans, designed for regular or long-term parking users. The subscription packages are priced as follows:These options provide cost savings and convenience for individuals who park frequently within these zones, particularly those employed in the area’s media, technology, and outsourcing sectors.The addition of the new T-code zones follows a series of expansions undertaken by Parkin throughout 2024. In August, new paid parking zones were introduced in Al Jaddaf, with Zone 326C (on-street) and Zone 326D (off-street) implementing variable charges that differ between peak and non-peak hours.During the same period, Parkin brought 2,100 parking spaces across 59 mosques in Dubai under its management. Worshippers are entitled to one hour of free parking during prayer times, while standard paid parking applies outside those hours.Earlier in the year, the operator introduced additional zones in Mirdif, which remain free on Sundays and public holidays and feature variable fees based on demand. A new parking zone was also announced in Al Khail Gate in July, further broadening Parkin’s reach across the emirate.Parkin’s latest expansion underscores its central role in shaping Dubai’s public parking infrastructure. By extending managed parking to fast-growing commercial areas such as Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, the company continues to support urban development with organised, technology-driven parking solutions.As Dubai’s population and business activity expand, these additions reflect a consistent strategy: extending accessibility, ensuring clarity through signposted zones, and offering flexible options for both short-term visitors and long-term residents.","Parkin PJSC, the emirate’s largest public parking operator, has added paid parking zones in Dubai Studio City and Dubai Outsource City, effective 31 October. The addition of the new T-code zones follows a series of expansions undertaken by Parkin throughout 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125009773,imgsize-1281284,width-400,resizemode-4/parkin.jpg"

Salik’s role in community mobility









Salik has updated toll charges for participants in the Dubai Ride, coinciding with the city-wide Dubai Fitness Challenge 2025.

The rates have been structured according to peak and low-peak hours:Salik emphasised that this move is part of its continued efforts to maintain smooth traffic flow during major community events.

"UAE: Delivery riders in Dubai and Sharjah face Dh1,500 fines and permit suspensions under new traffic rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-delivery-riders-in-dubai-and-sharjah-face-dh1500-fines-and-permit-suspensions-under-new-traffic-rules/articleshow/124986325.cms,"UAE tightens traffic rules to protect delivery riders / AI-generated illustration

New lane rules for delivery riders in Dubai and Sharjah

What’s changing: Penalties and monitoring

What delivery riders and customer should know

For delivery riders:

From Nov 1, check which lanes you’re allowed to use — it depends on the road width. Be aware of heightened surveillance (cameras, radars) and steeper fines/permit risks. Speed-limit behaviour is under sharper scrutiny.

For delivery companies:

Make sure riders are informed and trained on new rules. Update routing so bikes avoid prohibited lanes — this may affect delivery time slightly. Monitor riders’ permit status and company liability in case of violations.

For customers and general road users:

Expect improvements in lane discipline and perhaps fewer accidents involving delivery bikes. Delivery-times might get affected in the fine-tuning period. Awareness of the rules might help smoother traffic flow.

Conclusion





Food may still come fast, but delivery riders won’t be allowed to race to get it to you anymore. In a joint announcement made in late October 2025, Dubai’s RTA and Sharjah Police unveiled tough new traffic rules for delivery riders, warning that reckless riding could now lead to Dh1,500 fines, suspended permits, and even platform bans. The message from authorities is clear: safety over speed.From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles. In Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in coordination with Dubai Police will ban delivery riders from using the fastest lanes on major roads. On roads with five or more lanes, they cannot ride in the two leftmost (fastest) lanes; on roads with three or four lanes, they cannot use the leftmost lane. This change follows a rise in road accidents involving delivery riders.In Sharjah, authorities are implementing a dedicated lane-management system: heavy-vehicles and buses must keep to the far-right lanes, while motorcycles (including delivery bikes) will be restricted to the middle or right lanes depending on road width (for example: on a four-lane road they can use the two right-most lanes; on a two-lane road only the right lane).Enforcement will rely on smart radars, high-definition cameras and 24-hour monitoring.The new rules aren’t just about new signs, they come with significant consequences. In Dubai, fines start at AED 500 for a first offence, AED 700 for the second offence, and on the third violation the delivery rider’s permit may be suspended. Violations of speed limits (exceeding 100 km/h) by delivery bikes are also targeted: the first time AED 200, rising to AED 300 and AED 400 for repeat offences. In Sharjah, heavy vehicles failing to stay in designated lanes face fines up to AED 1,500 plus 12 traffic-black-points; riders ignoring lane signs may face fines around AED 500.The motive behind the crackdown: a steep rise in accidents involving delivery riders and the growing number of delivery bikes on the road, prompted by booming e-commerce and food-delivery sectors. These measures form part of broader traffic-safety strategies focusing on enforcement, road engineering and awareness campaigns.This latest crackdown clearly signals that Dubai and Sharjah are taking the rapid surge in delivery-motorcycle traffic seriously, and moving decisively from reactive to proactive traffic-safety governance. By strictly restricting faster lanes and consistently enforcing penalties, authorities hope to significantly reduce reckless riding, collisions, and fatalities. For riders, it means gradual adaptation; for everyone else, it means potentially safer roads and clearer separation of different types of vehicles.If you’re involved in the delivery business (rider, fleet manager, platform) or you’re a road user in these emirates, mark the date November 1, 2025, the rules change then. Being aware today means avoiding fines tomorrow.","From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles.

Orionid meteor shower peaks over US tonight: When and where to catch the blazing trails,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/orionid-meteor-shower-peaks-over-us-tonight-when-and-where-to-catch-the-blazing-trails/articleshow/124715574.cms,"The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers / Photo credit: NASA / Twitter [@NASA]

What’s the buzz about the Orionid Meteor shower?

Best time across the US

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country. The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Marc Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The job cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Marc Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch. He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace.

The Twin Shrines & The Hidden Imam: Rauza-e-Samarrah & Maqam-e-Ghaibat















Maqam-e-Ghaibat: Site Commemorating Samarra













For generations, Awadh rulers and nobles built replicas of Shia Islam’s holy shrines, facilitating those who could never make arduous journey to Karbala Kazmain, Kufa, or Samarra to touch the divine right here in Lucknow.Lucknow holds a unique spiritual secret — one of being a city mirroring the sacred geography of the distant country of Iraq . For generations, its rulers and nobles built painstaking replicas of Shia Islam’s holiest shrines, allowing those who could never make the arduous journey to Karbala, Kazmain, Kufa, or Samarra to touch the divine right here in Lucknow.Rising near the riverbank, the Karbala of Dayanat-ud-Daulah stands as a breathtaking testament to devotion.“Built by Wajid Ali Shah’s trusted ‘khwajasara’ (eunuch), Dayanat-ud-Daulah, it is an exact replica of the shrine of Imam Hussain in Karbala, Iraq – down to the very measurements,” claims Ammar Yasir Rizvi, an expert of Awadh’s cultural heritage.While the dome of the original shrine shines with pure gold, Lucknow’s version shimmered under thick sheets of gold-plated silver.Step inside, and intricate wooden pillars, kaleidoscopic stained glass, and dazzling mirror work create a space of hushed reverence, echoing the artistry of its Iraqi counterpart.“This isn’t merely architecture; it’s the soul of Karbala reborn in Lucknow, becoming the focal point for the city’s profound Muharram rituals, forever binding the fates of the two cities,” adds Rizvi.During the reign of King Amjad Ali Shah, a remarkable testament to unity arose. Kazmain, the replica of the Baghdad shrine housing the relics of the 7th Imam, Musa Kazim, was commissioned not by a Muslim noble, but by the Hindu minister in Jagan Nath (Sharaf-ud-Daula).“Its dimensions meticulously matched the original, a symbol of shared reverence transcending faith,” states Mehmood M Abdi, an oral historian and cultural expert. Adjacent to Kazmain lies another echo: Shabih-e-Masjid-e-Kufa. Built by Nawab Rafeeq-ud-Daulah, one of the ministers of King Muhammad Ali Shah, this mosque recreates the place where Hazrat Ali was martyred. “Every detail, from structure to its reddish-brown hue, mirrored the original Kufa mosque as it stood then,” explains Dr Sanobar Haider, a historian. “Adding a touch of practical devotion unique to Lucknow, it even houses a ‘dhoop-ghadi’ (sundial), ensuring prayers are called at the precise moment ordained by the sun,” she adds.Within Lucknow’s sacred complex, a poignant replica honours the young martyrs: Hazrat Muhammad and Hazrat Ibrahim, sons of Hazrat Muslim ibn Aqeel. Built by Munshi Fazal Husain during Wajid Ali Shah’s time, this Rauza mirrors their shrine in Musayyab, Iraq.It provides a place for Lucknow’s faithful to mourn these innocent souls, embodying the city’s tradition of creating Shabi-e-Rauza– local sanctuaries for those unable to pilgrimage to Iraq’s hallowed ground,” says Syed Husain Afsar, a veteran journalist.Deep within the Gharwali Karbala area, Lucknow’s connection to Samarra unfolds. Rauza-e-Samarrah (or Rauza-e-Askarien), commissioned by Malka Afaq Sahiba, wife of King Muhammad Ali Shah, is a replica of the magnificent Iraqi shrine complex housing the 10th and 11th Imams – Imam Ali al-Naqi (al-Hadi) and Imam Hasan al-Askari.“While less ornate than the original’s famed golden dome and minarets, this Lucknow counterpart, encompassing a mausoleum and Imambara, became a vital local centre for mourning and remembrance, especially during the commemorations of Imam Hasan al-Askari’s martyrdom, weathering times of both neglect and renewal,” says SN Lal, veteran journalist and author of the book ‘Azadari aur Awadh’.Beside this sacred echo lies perhaps the most profound symbol: The Maqam-e-Ghaibat. This site commemorates the very spot in Samarra, Iraq, associated with the occultation (Ghaibat) of the 12th Imam, Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi. “In Lucknow, this symbolic Maqam, integrated near the Rauza-e-Samarrah, draws devotees who pray for the Imam’s reappearance,” explains Zulkifl Rizvi, who writes on Lucknow’s cultural heritage. “Marked by Alams and religious symbols, it stands as a powerful testament to Lucknow’s profound tradition – replicating not just buildings, but the very essence of Iraq’s sacred geography, forging an unbreakable spiritual link between the banks of the Tigris and the Gomti,” he adds.","For generations, Awadh rulers and nobles built replicas of Shia Islam’s holy shrines in Iraq, enabling devotees to experience sacred geography locally.

Why it matters





Every four years, New York City chooses a mayor — and every time, the rest of America pays attention.The office controls a $100 billion budget, oversees nearly nine million residents, and serves as a political test case for everything from housing policy to ideological branding.The New York mayor’s race is technically local, but culturally national — a preview of what Americans argue about next.: Tuesday, November 4, 2025.: Ranked-choice voting, where voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference.: Progressive Democrat Zohran Mamdani , independent candidate and former governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.This mix makes it one of the most ideologically diverse races in years — a left-wing socialist, an establishment centrist, and a conservative populist all vying to run the city that calls itself the capital of capitalism.Rent and housing costs are the dominant issues. Mamdani’s promise to “freeze the rent” has struck a chord with younger, working-class, and immigrant voters, but critics call it unrealistic. Cuomo, pitching moderation, talks about balancing affordability with investment.Crime rates have stabilised but perceptions haven’t. How candidates talk about the NYPD — whether to reform it, fund it, or restrain it — remains a litmus test across boroughs.Subway delays, fare hikes, and bus reliability are daily grievances. Expect “fare-free buses” and “green transit” to feature prominently in debates.Mamdani’s candidacy — as a Ugandan-Indian Muslim socialist — represents the most unapologetically left-wing platform in modern city politics. Cuomo, meanwhile, represents the Democratic establishment’s survival instinct.The clash isn’t just about policies, but about what kind of politics the city wants to embody.Even though this is a city race, it’s being read as a referendum on America’s ideological direction after Trump’s 2024 re-election.If Mamdani wins, it signals a revived progressive movement.If Cuomo or Sliwa win, it confirms that even deep-blue cities are swinging towards pragmatism or populism.: New Yorkers have embraced early and mail-in ballots; expect long voting periods and delayed results.: Expect heated televised debates — on rent, policing, Palestine, and taxes — with moments that go viral nationally: Candidates will campaign across boroughs, often in multiple languages, targeting immigrant-heavy districts in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.: Ranked-choice voting and mail ballots mean final results might take days, not hours.: The winner won’t just be who gets the most votes — but who manages to build the broadest second-choice coalition.The New York mayoralty has historically been a launchpad for national figures — from Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg to Bill de Blasio.But this year’s race reflects a deeper question: can progressive politics scale beyond activism and actually govern a city that embodies both Wall Street and wage struggle?The world’s cameras will once again point to the city aliens always attack first — not because it’s symbolic of destruction, but because it’s still the testing ground for human chaos and political reinvention.","The New York mayor’s race is technically local, but culturally national.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
