Ahaus: Visiting Germany's 'smartest' town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ahaus-visiting-germanys-smartest-town/articleshow/117388160.cms,"(AP photo)

QR-Codes galore in the 'smartest town'

Digitization to halt urban decline in Germany

Cashless and free of conflict

Local currency to keep money in town

On a typical day in December, visitors arrive at Smartel, one of the bigger hotels in Ahaus , a town of 40,000 inhabitants in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.Pulling their rolling suitcases and with mobile phones in hand, guests are ready to scan a QR code on a terminal screen at the entrance.Rather than being greeted by a receptionist, arriving guests must use their smartphones to navigate the hotel. These devices not only open doors but also control room heating and lighting as there are no switches.In the hallway and lobby, cleaning robots are quietly humming. The only humans you may occasionally encounter are the kitchen staff replenishing the breakfast buffet.Peter Sommer explains that the Smartel was formerly named the Ratshotel Residenz, which used to be the largest hotel in town. Sommer, a travel guide from Smart City Ahaus, says the building's glorious past came to an end in the early 2000s.After struggling to find a new owner, Ahaus-based digitization company Tobit decided in 2017 to turn the hotel's fortunes around by modernizing the building and equipping its 44 rooms with the latest smart-home technology that one of its subsidiaries, Chayns, develops.What's striking in this medium-sized German town is the huge number of blue-and-white circular stickers with QR codes attached to virtually everything. Bearing the Chayns logo, they can be found on restaurant tables, hotel doors and riverboats, as well as rent-out bicycles, supermarket shelves, and even on the games cabinet in the town park. They provide an easy way to digitally book, pay for and unlock many amenities.At the end of 2024, Ahaus was crowned the smartest rural municipality in Germany following the nationwide ""Digital Places 2024"" contest organized by the Deutschland ‚Äî Land der Ideen (Germany ‚Äî Land of Ideas) initiative.The government-sponsored campaign is intended to enhance Germany's international visibility as a hub of ideas and innovation and is supported by business and civil society.Prize-winning Ahaus was commended for integrating multiple applications into a single platform that is easy to access with an app that requires one-time registration with contact and banking data.For Margarete, a caregiver from nearby Velen, the Ahaus experience provides a glimpse of what the future in her hometown could look like. She has joined us on the guided tour and laments that in Velen you will no longer even find a local supermarket. If she wants to go out for dinner, she has to make a reservation days in advance.So-called urban decline is a problem for many smaller towns in Germany due to population loss, economic stagnation and lack of investment. Small shops and cinemas are disappearing, while hospitality businesses are struggling to find staff and customers. Could massive investment in digitization stem the silent death of these communities?In Ahaus, finding enough people to work at tourist attractions, for instance, is no longer an issue. Humans are no longer required at the boat rental service situated near the town's baroque water castle.Bikes and umbrellas can also be rented digitally, just like meals at the local TKWY diner. There, a video screen shows who's next to pick up their food after being ordered on the Chayns app.Margarete finds this ""a bit impersonal,"" and says she would miss the casual chatting with the waiters. ""But efficient,"" counters our tour guide, Peter, arguing that staff can now focus on the cooking. Knowledge of the German language also ""doesn't matter,"" he contends, because the food can be ordered in different languages.In the bars and pubs of Ahaus, staffing needs are also minimal as bartenders and waiters only serve what guests have prepaid online, eliminating disputes over bills and age verification. Users' data is stored in their Chayns account.According to Tobit, almost 80% of all hospitality businesses in Ahaus use the Chayns app, whose service has grown to include farmers, sports clubs, and other service providers. They use Tobit's digital network to sell products or grant cashless access to facilities around the clock.At a pub named The Unbrexit, waiter Sven Klawikowski still brings drinks and meals to the tables. But he no longer needs to take orders, process payments, or check in with customers to see what else they need. With ten tables to look after, this saves enough time to equal the workload of an entire shift, he says. Moreover, he can afford to work just four days a week, while still receiving a full week's wage.The Wallstreet Bar , close by, is one of the formerly empty properties in Ahaus that were purchased by Tobit to test out its technology. Inside the bar, a stock market ticker continuously scrolls across a huge screen.While having a drink, customers can invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, or commodities. But this offer is just for fun as it's only a virtual reality game without real money.""We can test new technologies and make them accessible to other cities,"" says Sommer.Benedikt Homm√∂le, head of Ahaus Marketing & Tourism, thinks tech companies like Tobit find it easier to pilot their beta-phase projects in the town because the municipality and its residents are on board. ""We embrace the living lab concept. We're the guinea pigs, but in return, we have things here that others don't,"" he told DW.One frequently replicated digital concept is the so-called city voucher, a local digital currency that, according to Tobit, has been emulated by more than 70 municipalities.In Ahaus, the vouchers are used as welcome gifts to new residents and the winners of the weekly online quiz. Employers also use city vouchers to distribute monthly subsidies to workers. They are also popular as presents or pocket money.However, the money can only be spent in the town and must be used within a limited timeframe. ""You can use it to buy dog food, bread rolls, or new tires,"" says Homm√∂le, adding that vouchers worth close to ‚Ç¨800,000 ($816,000) are now circulating each year.As Ahaus is situated close to Germany's border with the Netherlands, the town is popular with Dutch tourists. At the end of our tour, Peter Sommer recalls a recent visit by mayors of 10 Dutch towns and cities, which are known for being more open to all things digital than Germany.Sommer says that for Germans, Ahaus feels like pure science fiction. The Dutch visitors merely stated, ""Not bad for Germany.""","Ahaus, a town of 40,000 inhabitants in the western German state of North Rhine- Westphalia, was crowned the smartest rural municipality in Germany.

With Love, Meghan

The Duchess of Sussex , Meghan Markle has announced the passing of her beloved dog, Guy, in a heartfelt Instagram tribute, in a post on Tuesday. She shared a touching video montage of her 'sweet' companion, who was scheduled to appear in her upcoming Netflix programme.The Duchess expressed her profound grief, acknowledging countless tears shed whilst thanking her faithful pet for years of unwavering devotion. She titled the tribute ""advocating for pet adoption with a compilation of photographs and videos.""In 2015, I adopted a beagle from a dog rescue in Canada. He had been at a kill shelter in Kentucky and given a few days to live. I swooped him up‚Ä¶.and fell in love. They referred to him as ‚Äòthe little guy‚Äô because he was so small and frail, so I named him ‚ÄòGuy‚Äô. And he was the best guy any girl could have asked for,"" the mother-of-two said in her post.Meghan continued, ""He endured a terrible accident shortly before I moved to the UK which had him undergoing surgeries for several months and unable to leave the clinic. Doctors said he would never walk again, but Dr Noel Fitzpatrick said he could do it. He and I would drive late at night, after hours, to see Guy as he recovered in Surrey for months on end.""This marks her third Instagram post since launching her Netflix series on her new account,""If you followed me on Instagram back in the day, you saw a lot of him - and on The Tig too. He was with me at Suits, when I got engaged, (and then married), when I became a mom‚Ä¶.he was with me for everything: the quiet, the chaos, the calm, the comfort,"" she said.""Thank you for loving him so much,"" she wrote, conveying her appreciation to Dr Noel and the team at Queen West Animal Hospital .""As many of you will see Guy in this new series, I hope you‚Äôll understand why his loss has devastated me. I think you might fall a little in love with him too,"" she further emphasised.""I have cried too many tears to count - the type of tears that make you get in the shower with the absurd hope that the running water on your face will somehow make you not feel them, or pretend they‚Äôre not there. But they are. And that‚Äôs okay too. Thank you for so many years of unconditional love, my sweet Guy.

Did UK media downplay pakistani grooming gangs scandal? Here's the truth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/did-uk-media-downplay-pakistani-grooming-gangs-scandal-heres-the-truth/articleshow/116995456.cms,"File photo

Using data to examine the issue

Stark media gap before 2011

The numbers don't lie: Grooming gangs vs other scandals

Relative neglect in the media

Cultural and political taboo

A national scandal that can't be ignored

A call for accountability

Matthew James Goodwin , a prominent British political scientist, recently questioned the media's handling of the UK's grooming gangs scandal, suggesting that it has not received sufficient coverage. His remarks sparked criticism from some journalists, but Goodwin is undeterred. He decided to take a closer look at the data to assess the media‚Äôs treatment of the issue.Goodwin used Lexis, a database employed by researchers to track content across UK newspapers, to analyze media coverage from 2011 to 2025. He made sure to account for criticisms, specifically addressing how the term ""grooming gangs"" is used in the media. His findings, he insists, will shed light on how the scandal has been covered‚Äîor neglected.One of Goodwin‚Äôs main points is that until 2011, the media largely ignored the grooming gangs crisis, despite widespread rumors and groups like the BNP and EDL pushing it into public discourse. He credited Andrew Norfolk of The Times for starting early coverage, despite facing abuse and harassment. It wasn't until 2011 that any major media outlet seriously began to report on the issue.From 2011 to 2025, Goodwin found a total of 4,659 articles about grooming gangs. On the surface, this may seem like a substantial number, but when compared to coverage of other topics, it appears minimal. For example, the term ""white privilege"" appeared in 6,146 articles, ""anti-Muslim"" in 17,152, and ""Islamophobia"" in 23,461.Goodwin points out that while there were certainly outlets that covered the grooming gangs issue, like The Times, the coverage still pales in comparison to other race-related stories. In fact, newspapers like The Guardian had only 113 articles about grooming gangs during the same period, compared to over 3,000 articles on ""Islamophobia.""The BBC‚Äôs coverage is similarly skewed. Goodwin found 357 specific mentions of grooming gangs in BBC News and Radio 4 transcripts, while George Floyd's case generated over 7,500 mentions, and ""Islamophobia"" garnered over 2,000.The political scientist believes that the relative media silence on grooming gangs can be attributed to the media‚Äôs reluctance to challenge narratives surrounding immigration, multiculturalism, and ""diversity."" He argues that these topics are too politically sensitive for much of the media to address openly, especially when they might contradict the prevailing liberal views held by the educated elites who control much of the UK‚Äôs media.In a passionate appeal, Goodwin credits Elon Musk for forcing the UK to reckon with this national scandal. Thanks to Musk‚Äôs influence, millions are now learning about the horrors of the grooming gangs for the first time or discovering new, shocking details. Goodwin believes this newfound awareness will lead the public to ask critical questions: Why was this ignored? Who is accountable? What‚Äôs being done to stop it?Goodwin concludes by urging the UK media to confront the scandal head-on. He believes the media must push the issue to the forefront, give it the attention it deserves, and avoid focusing on distractions like the death of a single American man. The British public, he argues, is paying attention, and it‚Äôs time for the media to do the same.As Goodwin puts it, ‚ÄúFind the truth and tell us the truth.

What Happens if Jus Soli Is Cancelled?

The Terminal

Donald Trump‚Äôs back at it, tossing political grenades like it‚Äôs a reality TV show. His latest plot twist? Taking aim at birthright citizenship‚Äîthe rule that says if you‚Äôre born on American soil, you‚Äôre in the club. This age-old ‚Äújus soli‚Äù (fancy Latin for ‚Äúright of the soil‚Äù) might be on its way out, and if it happens, the citizenship game is about to get trickier. But don‚Äôt pack up your American dream just yet‚Äîthere‚Äôs still a way to claim your piece of the stars and stripes pie.Here‚Äôs your ultimate guide to navigating the new rules of the game.Think of this as the citizenship triathlon. You start with a green card, which you can score through family ties, an employer, or sheer perseverance. Hold onto it for 5 years (or 3 if you‚Äôve snagged yourself a US citizen spouse), pass a civics quiz that‚Äôs more history than TikTok trivia, and‚Äîbam!‚Äîyou‚Äôre officially American. It‚Äôs a grind, but hey, what‚Äôs the American dream without a little hustle?If your parents are US citizens, congratulations‚Äîyou‚Äôve got the ultimate cheat code. Born abroad but under 18? Move to the US with your folks and let them flash their citizenship papers. You‚Äôll be claiming your citizenship faster than you can say ‚Äúmom‚Äôs the best.‚ÄùNothing screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all in for America‚Äù like signing up for the military. Serve with honour, and the US might just fast-track your citizenship. Bonus: You‚Äôll get to rock a uniform and collect stories that would make even Captain America proud.Love doesn‚Äôt just conquer all; it also opens doors. Marry a US citizen, survive three years of shared Netflix accounts and Sunday brunches with the in-laws, and you‚Äôre well on your way to a US passport. Extra points if your spouse bakes apple pie and owns a dog named Freedom.If you‚Äôre a rocket scientist, tech prodigy, or award-winning artist, America might just roll out the red carpet. Exceptional talent can land you a green card, and from there, it‚Äôs just a quick civics test before you‚Äôre living the American dream. The bar‚Äôs high, but if anyone can do it, it‚Äôs you.Feeling lucky? Enter the Diversity Visa Lottery , where the prize isn‚Äôt money but something far more valuable‚Äîa green card. It‚Äôs like winning a golden ticket to the Willy Wonka factory, except this factory comes with cheeseburgers and baseball.If your home country is unsafe or unstable‚Äîwhether due to war, persecution, or unbearable conditions‚Äîyou may qualify for asylum or refugee status in the US. These programs offer a lifeline to those in need of protection, allowing you to start anew in a country that values freedom and opportunity. Once settled, you can apply for citizenship and begin building a future that feels secure and full of possibility. It‚Äôs not an easy journey, but for many, it‚Äôs a path to safety, stability, and the chance to thrive.If birthright citizenship gets the axe, the US could adopt a more European approach, where citizenship is based on your parents‚Äô status, not where you‚Äôre born. That could leave some children stateless, like Tom Hanks in, but without the Hollywood ending. The good news? Birthright citizenship is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, so Trump‚Äôs executive order faces an uphill battle in court. Until the legal dust settles, keep your eye on the prize: US citizenship is still achievable, even if the road gets a little bumpier. The American Dream isn‚Äôt dead‚Äîit‚Äôs just getting a new season. Grab your popcorn, stay determined, and you‚Äôll be singing the Star-Spangled Banner before you know it.","If birthright citizenship gets the axe, the US could adopt a more European approach, where citizenship is based on your parents‚Äô status, not where you‚Äôre born.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Elon Musk Dances Up A Storm At Trump‚Äôs Big Event; Salute Gesture Causes A Storm | 'Nazi' Salute?

Donald Trump returned as the 47th President of the United States of America on Monday, January 20. Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration ‚Äúour sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced."" ‚ÄúFrom this moment on,‚Äù he added, ""America‚Äôs decline is over.‚ÄùTrump started the day with a prayer service at St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Church. The Church service at St. John‚Äôs in Washington is a tradition for presidential inaugurations. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception.The biggest American tech leaders Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and Starlink CEO Elon Musk too were seen at the Church services. Interestingly, the CEOs of America's biggest technology companies sat together, almost next to the Trump family.In one of the pictures Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO are spotted looking at their smartphones.Little surprising for Google CEO to be using Pixel 9 series smartphone; but it seems Elon Musk has made peace with Apple teaming up with ChatGPT maker. The Tesla CEO was quite upset with the partnership between Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. In a post to X, formerly Twitter, the Tesla CEO said he would ban Apple (AAPL) devices at his companies ‚Äî which include SpaceX and X, among others ‚Äî if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans.If Apple ‚Äúintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,‚Äù Musk said that would constitute ‚Äúan unacceptable security violation.‚Äù He added that visitors ‚Äúwill have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage‚Äù. ‚ÄúApple has no clue what‚Äôs actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,‚Äù Musk said in a separate post. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre selling you down the river.‚Äù","Donald Trump returned as the 47th President of the United States of America on Monday, January 20.

Apple is reportedly gearing up to unveil its next-generation iPad Air lineup, featuring the powerful M3 chip . According to a leak by well-known leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming iPad Air models will include both the familiar 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes, powered by the M3 chipset.The M3 chip, while not Apple's top-of-the-line chipset (reserved for the iPad Pro's M4), represents a significant upgrade from the previous M2 chip used in the last iPad Air models. This update promises to boost performance by up to 15%, making it a solid choice for users seeking a more powerful tablet for everyday tasks, multitasking, video editing, and gaming.Despite the internal upgrade, the new iPad Air models are expected to maintain the same sleek and thin profile that has become synonymous with the iPad Air line.

The executive order, signed on January 21, 2025, delays the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which took effect on January 19.The law, passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden, aimed to prohibit the distribution and updating of TikTok due to concerns that the Chinese government could exploit the app to spy on Americans or covertly influence US public opinion through data collection and content manipulation. TikTok had shut down in the United States late Saturday as the deadline passed, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.Trump, who had promised to move quickly to save TikTok from the ban, stated, ""I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn't have originally, but I went on TikTok and I won young people,"" crediting the app for delivering him the youth vote in his election.Under the executive order, the attorney general must issue guidance implementing the pause and send letters to service providers confirming they won't face liability for continuing to host or update TikTok during this period. This clarification is crucial for companies like Apple and Google, which would otherwise be required to remove TikTok from their app stores and block updates, facing penalties of up to $5,000 per user if the app is accessed.The 75-day pause is intended to give the new administration time to ""pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans,"" according to the order.","Donald Trump has ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the United States.

Jade Cargill Seems to be Close to a WWE Return

Jade Cargill has been missing from WWE TV for a little over two months now. Cargill was ambushed and injured in a backstage segment on SmackDown which aired right before Survivor Series 2024.

She has the appearance and the ring presence needed to be an absolute star in the WWE. However, her wrestling skills often leave a lot to be desired. But, it seems like Cargill is about to shut down all of her critics. As per various reports, Cargill has been hard at work inside the WWE Performance Center.PWInsider noted that Cargill will return to the Performance Center for the third straight week and she might not even stop there. From the looks of it, Cargill seems to be raring to go. It must be hard for her to be sidelined especially since Naomi came in and replaced her as the Women‚Äôs Tag Team Champion alongside Bianca Belair .The fact that Bianca Belair has allowed this to happen also seems a little off. With all of this going on, Cargill will have a lot to do when she makes her eventual return to the ring. However, where and when that will be is yet to be decided. Hopefully, all this time away from WWE TV will help Cargill work on her shortcomings as a wrestler and bring a new version of herself into the ring.ALSO READ: Jade Cargill Breaks Silence With Cryptic Message After SmackDown Attack If she can improve her wrestling skills, the sky is the limit for Jade Cargill.

What WWE Fans Didn‚Äôt See: The Undertaker‚Äôs Netflix Raw Debut That Never Was

WWE, Netflix, & John Cena's Farewell: Undertaker Talks Wrestling's Future | Six Feet Under #49

The WWE Universe witnessed a truly iconic moment on the historic Raw debut on Netflix . After Rhea Ripley successfully reclaimed the Women's World Championship, the lights dimmed, and a chilling presence descended upon the arena. The Undertaker , the legendary Phenom, emerged, riding his iconic motorcycle, to bestow his seal of approval upon the new champion. It was a scene that sent shivers down the spines of fans worldwide. However, the Deadman revealed the original plan for his appearance was far more understated.During his appearance on the Six Feet Under podcast, Undertaker talked about his experiences with the show. He said that initially, he was not excited about the prospect of appearing for an interview segment, but plans changed to feature The Deadman interacting with Ripley:‚ÄúOriginally, I was going to do an entrance and an interview, which would have been fine. I think they had somebody that was going to interview me. And then they just thought (Taker appearing after Ripley vs. Morgan) would make that whole thing even bigger for (Ripley). When they told me, at first, I was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äô And I was like, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs her moment. I don‚Äôt want to step on any part of that. This is the payoff to a very long storyline and I sure don‚Äôt want to come out and step on her moment.‚Äô‚ÄùFurthermore, Undertaker was more receptive to the concept after it was clarified that his appearance would not detract from Ripley in any way:‚ÄúThey basically explained that she‚Äôs going to have a moment in the ring, she‚Äôs going to have this moment where you two will cross paths. And I was like, ‚ÄòOkay, well now if it‚Äôs like that then it‚Äôs pretty cool. Not that our characters are similar, but they are a little bit. It was just me dabbing her up there a little bit.‚ÄùThere were issues earlier in the day, but The Deadman's appearance on the show went off without a hitch. The Undertaker also discussed on his podcast why he came dangerously close to disaster several times.Nonetheless, thankfully, someone at WWE had a better idea. The result? A spine-tingling, unforgettable moment that perfectly encapsulated the magic of The Undertaker and the grandeur of the Raw on Netflix premiere.","The WWE Universe witnessed a truly iconic moment on the historic Raw debut on Netflix.
