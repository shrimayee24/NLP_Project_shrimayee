The first public godchild and Taylor Swift’s bond with Jaime King

Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the godchildren who inspired Taylor Swift’s songs

Pop icon Taylor Swift may dominate the music charts and headlines for her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , but there’s another side to her that doesn’t often make the spotlight: her role as a godmother. Beyond the stadium appearances and sold-out tours, Swift plays a personal role in the lives of several celebrity children, showcasing the depth of her friendships and her influence beyond music.Taylor Swift’s first widely known godchild is Leo Thames King, son of actress Jaime King. Born in 2015, Leo quickly became a part of Swift’s inner circle, with the singer even penning emotional words inspired by the moment.When she first met him, Swift posted a touching photo with the caption, “Meeting my boy.” Jaime King, once a core member of Swift’s famous “squad,” has often spoken highly of her friend, calling her a “beautiful human being.” For King, naming Swift as godmother was “a really sacred thing,” signaling not just a celebrity connection but a genuine trust in the singer’s character.The most notable godparent role Swift holds is with the children of Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.She is godmother to James, Inez, Betty, and Olin — a fact Swift humorously acknowledged while promoting Deadpool & Wolverine, writing, “Shout out to Wade Wilson, aka my godkids’ sperm donor.” Ryan Reynolds later clarified, “Swift is the godparent to my daughters.”Interestingly, the names James, Inez, and Betty are immortalized in Swift’s Folklore album, making her godmother role not just private but also creatively celebrated.Also Read: “She doesn’t include Blake”: Taylor Swift leans on Travis Kelce’s support and no longer values Blake Lively’s advice With five godchildren, Swift’s personal influence in Hollywood runs as deep as her professional success. And as her relationship with Travis Kelce continues to capture public imagination, her nurturing, family-centered side only reinforces why she remains one of the most admired figures in entertainment — both on and off the stage.Months after wrapping up her high-grossing Era Tour, Taylor Swift announced her twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl. Instead of announcing the album at an award show like she did with Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department, Swift decided to announce it on her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother Jason Kelce’s New Heights podcast on August 12, 2025.The Life of a Showgirl looks like it’s going to have nine lives and then some, when it comes to variant editions with different album cover images and vinyl color schemes.","Taylor Swift's first widely known godchild is Leo Thames King, son of actress Jaime King.

Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s steakhouse gets family-approved ahead of launch



The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is set to open 1587 Prime, his new steakhouse with teammate Travis Kelce , on Sept. 17. That also marks his 30th birthday. The restaurant, a joint venture with hospitality group Noble 33, will occupy 10,000 square feet over two floors inside the Loews Kansas City Hotel.In an exclusive interview with People during the red carpet premiere of ESPN’s Chiefs docuseries The Kingdom, Randi revealed she’s proud of how invested Mahomes has been in the project, especially the food.“I’m really proud,” she said. “I didn’t know he would be that excited about a restaurant, but he really, really is.”The Mahomes family plans to visit 1587 Prime on a private date, but the public opening is officially locked for Sept. 17. Reservations began on Aug. 20 at 12 p.m. CST, and the opening night was fully booked within hours.Mahomes’ mom didn’t hold back when teasing the upcoming menu. According to her, it features favorite dishes inspired by both Mahomes and his wife Brittany Mahomes, who also commented “Let’s goooooo” on the restaurant’s Instagram announcement. Randi laughed about her own omission, saying: “I’m like, ‘What about mom here?’ But I love everything.I’ve tasted a lot of it, and so, it’s been fun.”The steakhouse name combines Mahomes’ and Kelce’s jersey numbers, 15 and 87. According to The Independent and The New York Post, the venue will feature “hyper-subtle nods” to their NFL careers, including a meat display and private dining spaces.Kelce himself praised the food during the first menu tasting, which included wagyu beef, steak flights, and a Japanese A5 wagyu smash burger. He said: “What’s better than to break food with people over good food, good drinks and a cool vibe?”Mahomes added: “Kansas City loves food. The city’s gonna love it.”The restaurant is also expected to offer a “multi-sensory dining experience,” though no official breakdown of that concept has been shared. Donna Kelce, Travis’ mother, showed her support on Facebook, writing: “Can’t wait for Patrick’s & Travis’ steakhouse to open on the first floor of Loew’s hotel in Kansas City!!!”","Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s steakhouse gets family-approved ahead of launch.

"Nikki Bhati death case: Aspiring influencer, Vipin posted on cars and bikes, but never his wife",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/aspiring-influencer-vipin-bhati-posted-on-cars-bars-on-instagram-account-never-his-wife-nikki/articleshow/123511805.cms,"NOIDA: Vipin Bhati's Instagram feed tells a story he carefully scripted — one of fast cars, flashy rings, and a circle of friends, but not a hint of his domestic life.His posts are a parade of SUVs, bikes, and designer shirts, set to the beats of Punjabi heartbreak songs and Gurjar community anthems. This digital veil has been lifted now — Vipin is accused of killing his wife Nikki, allegedly for her presence on the very platform where he built his own identity.A closer look at his social media presence reveals a man obsessed with image. Even his handle, gurjar.6668, is a nod to his prized white Scorpio — its registration number woven into his online identity. His display name, written in Hindi, is Chaudhary Vipu Gurjar.Pinned at the top of his profile are two telling posts. In one, Vipin poses for a mirror selfie at a clothing store, the triple camera of his iPhone Pro Max catching the light. In the other, he appears in a floral blue shirt and chunky gold chain, syncing his moves to a Punjabi song with the refrain, ""she was never mine"".A few posts down the scroll, the pattern is clearer. Vipin's grid is dominated by stylised shots of SUVs and motorbikes, often with him at the wheel, gold rings flashing.Reels show him striding through malls or along highways, sometimes against the backdrop of hills, always in slow motion. Gurjar community songs play over some videos, their lyrics celebrating reputation and fearlessness. Lines like ""this guy is a gangster, be aware"" are often pinned to videos.In one of the posts, Vipin lights a firecracker atop a car and hurls it towards the person panning the camera on him, wishing his followers a ‘Happy Diwali'.But his posts are a spectacle of deception too. One of them, titled ""advocate"", features Vipin dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, posing with others in similar attire. He shares a story from inside the Noida district court and another of himself at a table stacked with case files.Yet, when reporters spoke to relatives in his Sirsa village and to his father-in-law, none could confirm that Vipin ever worked as a lawyer.Despite the occasional family photo — his mother appears a few times, his father and brother just once — there is a conspicuous absence. Neither his wife nor his five-year-old son appear anywhere on his public feed. Instead, the account projects the image of a bachelor with pool parties, club nights, ""boys' trips"" to the hills, and hookah sessions.He also hints at influence beyond his social circle. Some posts show him alongside Loni MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar at political rallies. In others, he poses with local police officers.Ironically, ties between Vipin and Nikki turned all the more testy because of their respective social media profiles. ""Vipin asked her to stop making videos, but Nikki continued,"" Dharmendra Shukla, the SHO of Kasna police station, had said.A couple of hours before being attacked, Nikki and Kanchan were involved in an argument with their mother-in-law after she objected to a Reel they were recording in a ""studio"" set up in the house.","Vipin Bhati is accused of killing his wife Nikki, allegedly for her presence on the very platform where he built his own identity.

Health meets audio



AirPods Pro 3: What to expect



Apple is reportedly preparing for the launch of its third generation Apple AirPods Pro this fall. Now a new online report suggests that the company may include in-ear heart rate monitoring in the device. This important health-focused update can definitely elevate the TWS from a simple audio accessory to an important part of Apple’s Health ecosystem. As reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple AirPods Pro 3 may include hearing health monitoring. The earbuds are said to come with built-in heart rate monitor .In his Power On newsletter, Gurman revealed that Apple may be working on AirPods Pro with sensors capable of tracking heart rate via blood flow. The similar technology is already being used in Powerbeats Pro 2. The model comes with LED optical sensors that pulse over 100 times per second to measure the heart rate.The inclusion of heart rate monitoring in AirPods Pro 3 will make a significant step for Apple and it will also make the device health-centric. If users are wearing both the new AirPods and an Apple Watch, apps are expected to default to the Watch’s data, but the earbuds will serve as a powerful standalone option for fitness tracking .Apart from the health features, the AiPods Pro 3 are also said to come with improved sound quality and enhanced active noise cancellation. The company is also said to make some design refinements to the earbuds.

A new sovereign could:

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused the company of racism.

Partial Lunar Eclipse: July 6, 2028 — a portion of the Moon will pass through Earth’s shadow

Next Total Lunar Eclipse visible from UAE: December 31, 2028 — coinciding with New Year’s Eve, offering another spectacular display

A dramatic and unusually long total lunar eclipse will light up the skies above the UAE on the night of September 7, 2025, turning the Moon a deep red during an 82-minute totality — one of the longest such events in recent years. The eclipse, visible across much of the globe, will offer residents and global viewers a rare chance to witness a breathtaking astronomical display, with public events and global livestreams planned.On September 7, 2025, the UAE will experience a total lunar eclipse, an event in which the Earth positions itself precisely between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow fully across the lunar surface. This alignment causes the Moon to turn a red, copper, or orange hue — a phenomenon popularly known as the Blood Moon.This reddish color results from sunlight being refracted through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out shorter blue wavelengths and allows the longer red tones to reach the Moon’s surface.What makes this eclipse especially notable is the length of totality, lasting a full 82 minutes, and the overall eclipse duration of nearly five and a half hours, one of the longest in recent memory. According to the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), the event is not only rare for its duration but also for its global visibility, potentially viewable by 87% of the world’s population.The lunar eclipse will unfold gradually through several distinct phases. Each stage offers a different visual experience, and residents in the UAE will be able to observe the entire sequence clearly:The most visually dramatic moment, totality, will occur between 9:30 PM and 10:53 PM, when the Moon is fully engulfed in Earth’s umbra and glows with intense red shades depending on atmospheric conditions.For the public, the Dubai Astronomy Group will organize a special viewing event in Dubai, allowing residents and tourists to gather and witness the phenomenon together. Details about the event venue and activities are expected to be announced soon. A standout moment will be a carefully planned photo opportunity: a Blood Moon rising behind the Burj Khalifa, captured in collaboration with renowned photographer Rami Dibo.To ensure global accessibility, DAG will also host a livestream of the full eclipse. The broadcast will feature:This global streaming effort aims to bring together astronomy enthusiasts worldwide for a shared celestial experience.Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye — no protective glasses or filters are needed. However, for those wanting an enhanced viewing experience, DAG recommends the following:If you miss this eclipse, there are a few more chances in the coming years:","On September 7, 2025, the UAE will witness an 82-minute total lunar eclipse, turning the Moon a vivid red.

Unlike cars or buses, being on foot allows you to slow down, take in the atmosphere, and interact with the culture at street level. While many global cities are working towards becoming more pedestrian-friendly, Morocco’s Medina of Fes has already perfected it. Recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, this medieval walled city holds the title of the largest car-free urban area in the world, where over 156,000 people live without cars, surrounded by centuries of history.The Medina of Fes dates back to the 13th century and has long been considered Morocco’s cultural and spiritual heart.With its maze-like alleys, bustling souks, and exquisite architecture, the medina offers an unmatched pedestrian-friendly environment. The only “traffic” you will encounter here are donkeys, handcarts, and streams of people wandering through colourful markets. This unique design not only preserves the old-world charm of the city but also creates a healthier, quieter, and more sustainable way of life. Visitors can explore historic monuments, enjoy local cuisine, and experience traditional crafts without the stress of vehicles, making walking through Fes an immersive and leisurely cultural adventure.The pedestrian-friendly nature of Fes has helped protect its cultural significance and community spirit. Walking through the medina is like stepping back in time, narrow streets are lined with stalls selling spices, textiles, ceramics, and handcrafted copperware. Local artisans, from weavers to potters, continue traditions that have been passed down for generations. It is no surprise that UNESCO has listed the Medina of Fes as a World Heritage Site, recognising its importance to global cultural heritage.The city is not just about shopping and sightseeing. Each year, Fes hosts cultural celebrations such as the Festival of World Sacred Music, filling the squares and courtyards with performances from international artists. Cafés and rooftop restaurants like Mom’s Touch and Ruined Garden offer spaces to relax while enjoying authentic Moroccan cuisine, considered among the finest in the world.

What is U-visa?







Indian-origin New York man Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to. His prison sentence is followed by two years of supervised release and forfeiture of $850,000. After that, Patel is subject to deportation.Beginning in March 2023, Patel and his co-conspirator Balwinder Singh set up and carried out staged armed robberies of at least 18 convenience or liquor stores and fast-food restaurants across the United States, including at least five in Massachusetts. The purpose of the staged robberies was to allow the store clerks to claim that they were victims of a violent crime on an application for U nonimmigrant status (U visa). A U visa is available to victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and who have been helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.During the staged robberies, the “robber” would threaten store clerks and/or owners with an apparent firearm before taking cash from the register and fleeing, while the interaction was captured on store surveillance video.The clerks and/or owners would then wait five or more minutes until the “robber” had escaped before calling police to report the “crime.” The “victims” paid Patel to participate in the scheme. One purported victim paid $20,000 to participate as a victim in one of the staged armed robberies. In turn, Patel paid the store owners for the use of their stores for the staged robbery. Patel earned approximately $850,000 in the scheme, all of which he is required to forfeit as part of his sentence.At least two purported victim co-conspirators submitted U Visa applications based on being victims of the staged armed robberies.The U visa is a type of non-immigrant visa in the United States created to protect victims of certain serious crimes who have suffered significant physical or mental abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. It was designed to encourage undocumented victims to come forward without fear of deportation, thereby strengthening public safety. To qualify, the crime must fall under specific categories such as domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, kidnapping, or similar offenses, and the victim must provide helpful information to authorities. The U visa grants legal status in the US for up to four years, along with work authorization, and after three years, holders may apply for a green card. Family members, including spouses, children, and in some cases parents or siblings, may also benefit through derivative visas, making the program a vital form of protection and relief for vulnerable victims of crime.","Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to.

Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart. With this move, Dubai further strengthens its status as a global leader in AI-driven governance, offering residents and visitors 24/7 access to fully automated, human-free policing services—now across 27 locations.Smart Police Stations (SPS) are a first-of-their-kind innovation in the Middle East. These self-service, unmanned stations operate entirely without physical police personnel. Accessible 24/7, they provide a fast, contactless, and secure alternative to traditional policing setups.Each SPS enables users to complete essential police services digitally—via a simple, secure process that begins with ID verification using either an Emirates ID (for residents) or a passport (for visitors), followed by mobile number authentication via SMS. For services requiring interaction, users are connected through a video interface to an on-duty officer, with on-site access to facilities like scanners and printers to complete paperwork.Once a transaction is completed, users receive a reference number via SMS and receipt, allowing for easy tracking as requests are routed to the appropriate police departments for further action.Services are accessible in seven languages—Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, and Chinese—reflecting Dubai’s multicultural population and making processes user-friendly for both locals and international visitors.Dubai’s SPSs offer a broad suite of 45 fully digital services, organised under four main categories:Since launching the world’s first SPS in City Walk in 2017, Dubai has continuously expanded its smart policing infrastructure. The network now includes 27 fully operational SPS locations—ranging from central commercial areas to suburban and residential districts.In 2018, a walk-in model of SPS was introduced at Arabian Ranches to expand accessibility. By 2023, plans were set in motion for a floating SPS at the World Islands, showcasing the innovative trajectory of Dubai’s policing model.Dubai’s SPS framework has drawn global attention, with police commanders from several countries studying its implementation as a future model for digitised public security services.The SPS initiative directly supports the UAE’s national artificial intelligence strategy, which aims to future-proof government systems, increase digital readiness, and enhance public service efficiency.Under the directives of Lieutenant General Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, Commander-in-Chief of Dubai Police, the rollout of smart police stations is being actively expanded to cover commercial and residential zones across the emirate.Major General Khalid Nasser Al Razooqi, Director of the General Department of Artificial Intelligence at Dubai Police, emphasised that these smart centres are a critical part of Dubai’s vision to become the world’s smartest city. He noted that digital transactions now account for 89.6% of all police service interactions—a testament to public adoption and operational efficiency.","Dubai Police has taken a significant leap in modernising public services by opening a new Smart Police Station (SPS) in Dragon Mart.

In a defining moment at Expo 2025 Osaka, the UAE Pavilion has recorded over three million visitors since opening in April, solidifying its status as one of the most admired and frequently visited national pavilions at the global event.The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three-million visitor threshold — a milestone that reflects its broad international appeal, immersive experiences, and the compelling narrative it offers under the theme “Earth to Ether.”Opening its doors in mid-April 2025, the Pavilion has since established itself as a hub of dialogue, innovation, and cultural exchange. Visitors from around the world have been drawn to its engaging displays, sustainable architecture, and human-centric programming — all designed to reflect the UAE’s deep-rooted heritage and its ambitions for a globally inclusive and technologically progressive future.This landmark was marked on August 21st by a celebration on-site. The Pavilion team — including its Youth Ambassadors — welcomed guests with their hallmark hospitality, creating a moment of shared reflection and connection. These Youth Ambassadors have played an integral role in shaping the Pavilion experience, facilitating storytelling, encouraging cultural conversations, and leaving a meaningful impression on the millions of visitors who’ve walked through the Pavilion’s doors.Behind the Pavilion’s unique identity is its design, crafted by the Earth to Ether Design Collective — a collaboration of architects and creatives from the UAE, Japan, and other global partners. The structure is built with 90 architectural columns, inspired by the form and resilience of the date palm, and constructed using agricultural palm waste. This design not only pays homage to the UAE’s natural heritage but also embodies sustainable principles and an ethos of shared global progress.Inside, the Pavilion invites visitors on a journey across five thematic zones. Each space is thoughtfully curated to highlight key areas where the UAE is making bold strides, including:Interactive installations, sensory-driven storytelling, and a clear narrative flow allow visitors to explore these themes in a deeply engaging, memorable way.Beyond its architectural and thematic appeal, the UAE Pavilion has grown into a daily cultural destination within Expo 2025. Its dynamic programming includes:These daily activities draw both casual visitors and dedicated Expo participants, many of whom return for second or even third visits — a strong indicator of the Pavilion’s emotional and cultural impact.A notable highlight is the Pavilion’s food program. At the heart of it is Japan’s first-ever Emirati restaurant, located within the Pavilion, which has already attracted over 100,000 visitors. Traditional dishes such as lamb ouzi, loqaimat (sweet dumplings), and a signature drink made from camel milk, rehash, and toasted pistachio have offered Japanese and international guests a taste of Emirati hospitality and culinary tradition.In addition, summer culinary workshops for children and families have proven especially popular, with young Japanese participants learning the art of pastry-making under the guidance of Emirati chefs. These sessions not only share flavours but stories — offering a chance for participants to connect with Emirati culture through personal and sensory experiences.Commenting on the milestone, Shihab Alfaheem, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the UAE to Japan and Commissioner General of the UAE Pavilion, reflected on the significance of the Pavilion’s impact:“Reaching the three million mark is a huge milestone for the UAE Pavilion. It is a cherished achievement, and speaks to the global resonance of the UAE’s story and our shared aspirations for the future. Every visitor who walks through the Pavilion brings their own voice to our collective journey. Together, we are shaping a narrative that crosses borders, embraces diversity, and accelerates progress. With two months remaining, we want more guests to experience our pavilion. ”With Expo 2025 running until October 13, the Pavilion remains open and active — continuing to welcome visitors with the same warmth, curiosity, and openness that has defined its success so far.","The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three- million visitor threshold.

In a significant anti-narcotics operation, Abu Dhabi Police, in collaboration with the National Drug Control Service, have seized 377 kilograms of crystal meth and arrested three individuals. The suspects, Asian nationals, had attempted to conceal the drugs inside oil cans intended for sewing machines, deploying what authorities described as a ""sophisticated"" smuggling method. The bust not only highlights the vigilance of local law enforcement but also underscores the role of public reporting tools like the Aman Service in combating crime.Abu Dhabi Police announced the successful dismantling of a drug smuggling operation involving three Asian nationals who were found in possession of a large quantity of crystal methamphetamine, weighing a total of 377 kilograms. The operation was executed in coordination with the National Drug Control Service, reflecting a joint effort to target and eliminate narcotics trafficking in the region.According to Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Criminal Security Sector, the gang employed an unconventional concealment method by hiding the crystal meth inside oil cans manufactured for sewing machines.Authorities noted that this attempt to bypass detection systems demonstrated a high level of planning and ingenuity.However, the operation was foiled thanks to what Brig. Al Dhaheri described as the ""expertise and vigilance"" of the anti-narcotics teams. He emphasized that their ability to detect and intercept such a well-disguised cargo speaks to the strength of the emirate’s ongoing counter-narcotics strategy, which is supported by Abu Dhabi’s leadership and aligned with the national drug control agenda.After their arrest, the suspects were referred to the competent authority for legal proceedings.Alongside details of the bust, Abu Dhabi Police issued a strong public advisory warning residents not to fall prey to the common misconception that drug use leads to happiness or comfort. Brig. Al Dhaheri highlighted the serious negative effects of drug abuse, particularly its toll on personal health and public safety.Police reiterated that drugs, regardless of how they are presented or marketed by traffickers, carry grave health risks and contribute to broader social harm. They urged all community members to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity involving narcotics or related crimes.To support these efforts, the police pointed to the Aman Service, Abu Dhabi’s official platform for reporting cybercrimes and other serious offenses. Established in 2009, the Aman Service allows the public to confidentially share information related to security, cybercrimes, traffic incidents, and community threats.The service operates 24/7, year-round, and is not intended for filing police reports but specifically for providing intelligence or information that may help authorities prevent or investigate crimes.The Aman call centre supports Arabic, English, and Urdu, ensuring access for a wide range of residents. Authorities guarantee complete confidentiality for all individuals using the service to report criminal or suspicious activities.Residents are encouraged to use Aman to report incidents such as unauthorized access to personal accounts, blackmail, privacy violations, or the distribution of malicious content.","Gang hid 377kg of crystal meth inside oil cans made specifically for sewing machines, using them to bypass security detectors.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities.

Walls Closing In? Meghan Markle Faces Royal Cold Shoulder Amid New Fears: Reports

Different networks, same idea

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard









Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani ’s attempt to flex his muscles at a Men’s Day event in Brooklyn ended in an online pile-on, after the 33-year-old Democratic Socialist politician failed to complete unassisted bench press rep.At the annual open streets celebration on Saturday, Mamdani tried to hoist a 135-pound barbell in front of a cheering crowd. But videos doing rounds online showed his spotter never let go of the bar, guiding the weight through two assisted reps before the Democratic nominee stood up, thanked the helper and exited the bench.The botched show of strength gained eyeballs on social media, giving his political opponents a chance to take on a mocking jab.Mayor Eric Adams took to X to release his own older video from the same spot, effortlessly pressing the bar under the supervision of the same spotter.“64 vs 33. A lifetime of hard work vs. a silver spoon. The results speak for themselves,” Adams wrote on X. In another jab, he added, “The weight of the job is too heavy for ‘Mamscrawny.’ The only thing he can lift is your taxes.”Former governor Andrew Cuomo also took aim, posting: “It’s easy to talk, it’s hard to carry the burden.”“This guy can’t bench his own body weight, let alone carry the weight of leading the most important city in the world,” Cuomo quipped.While critics had a field day, Mamdani’s supporters called the episode as a distraction.“Public service should be about policy and integrity, not proving strength in a gym setting,” one user wrote, urging voters to judge candidates by ideas, not biceps.","Zohran Mamdani failed to bench 135-pound barbell at Brooklyn Men's Day event.
