Have RTI query? Take a scooter instead. Why answer seekers in Kashmir are hitting a wall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-rti-query-take-a-scooter-instead-why-answer-seekers-in-kashmir-are-hitting-a-wall/articleshow/124915998.cms,"Representative AI image

SRINAGAR: For the law students gathered last week at Tagore Hall — a modest state-run auditorium tucked behind Iqbal Park in Srinagar’s Gogji Bagh — filing RTI applications began as an exercise for their coursework. Soon, though, it became an early education in how power responds to questions. Some received partial replies. Others got silence. One was even offered a scooter. Yet others were contacted by people who suggested it would be better to let things go.Sabika Rasool had filed an RTI request about development meetings in her village in Pulwama. The reply didn’t come at first. A phone call to her father did. “They told him it doesn’t look good that I was filing such applications,” she said. Then came an unexpected offer — a scooter — if she withdrew it.A student at the University of Kashmir, Sabika had filed her request on Aug 1 to the rural development department. She wanted to know how often gram sabha meetings were held and what development works had followed. Her seemingly simple query triggered a quiet but unmistakable response from the local administration.When she visited the office in person, she was directed from one desk to another, only to be told ""the designated officer had been transferred"".A few days later, her father received a call. The caller said it would be better if his daughter didn’t pursue the matter. She received a 32-page reply in Urdu on Oct 15, listing 11 meetings and referencing projects under schemes like Har Ghar Jal. Sabika is not convinced that the data is accurate. But one thing changed: meetings are now announced in mosques. “At least people know when they’re happening,” she said.Dr Peerzada Farhat, the then assistant commissioner (development) at Pulwama, described the scooter claim as a “white lie”. “All data of the rural development department is online and accessible, and in public domain.”Like Sabika, these students had not set out to confront the state. Many had filed their RTIs as part of legal coursework. Yet in department after department, they found that even routine queries were met with delay, redirection, or informal pressure — delivered not through written denials, but through relatives, neighbours, or local influencers.When Idrees Farooq asked about the renovation of a stadium in Ganderbal — seeking costs, contractor names, floodlight installations and revenue from night matches — the response he received cited just Rs 31,500, without any details. Soon after, some of his relatives were contacted by officials. “I had to explain it wasn’t a complaint, just an RTI,” Farooq said.An official from the sports council department said they had responded properly to the RTI and encouraged the applicant to appeal, if unsatisfied. “There is a lot of politics involved in this matter, but despite that, we have provided our response. We do not look at it through a political lens,” she said.Some applicants didn’t receive a reply at all — but their questions still appeared to make something shift. Junaid Budoo, a student from Uri, had asked why a public library appeared on govt rolls but did not function. He heard nothing from the department of libraries. But within weeks, the library opened and staff began reporting for duty. “They didn’t send me a reply,” Budoo said, “but the library started functioning again. ”In Kargil, Ghulam Abbas filed an RTI with the irrigation and flood control department in Ladakh, seeking information about a long-stalled canal project in his village. Weeks later, it wasn’t an official who contacted him but his father — who’d been approached informally. “They told my father that the department had no old records, and my father then advised me to withdraw it,” Abbas said.In March this year, the J&K information technology department issued a press statement asserting that the Union Territory’s RTI portal — launched on Jan 10 — was “fully functional” and operating in compliance with the RTI Act, 2005. According to the department, over 15,800 applications had been filed, with 11,631 disposed and 4,260 in process.The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative reported in 2024 that RTI filings in J&K had fallen by 31% since 2022. The group attributed the decline to lack of oversight, extended delays, limited digital access in rural areas and what it called a “culture of discouragement.”","Law students in J&K filed RTIs as part of their coursework.

Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld left out of ‘Sinners’ Oscar song submissions as studio focuses on top contenders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allens-wife-hailee-steinfeld-left-out-of-sinners-oscar-song-submissions-as-studio-focuses-on-top-contenders/articleshow/124898400.cms,"Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners' is a strong awards contender, but Warner Bros. strategically submitted only two original songs for Oscar consideration. ""I Lied to You"" and ""Last Time (I Seen the Sun)"" were chosen to avoid splitting votes, despite fan outcry over Hailee Steinfeld's exclusion. Her track didn't meet Academy guidelines for inclusion in the film's narrative.

Only two tracks submitted for Best Original Song as strategy takes priority

Why Hailee Steinfeld’s contribution didn’t make the cut





Ryan Coogler’s Sinners has been positioned as one of the most powerful awards contenders of the year, a stylish vampire thriller with blockbuster appeal and prestige filmmaking credentials. From its bold production design to a breakout performance by Miles Caton, the film has checked nearly every box needed for a major Oscars campaign. But there’s one category where the studio made tighter decisions than fans expected: Best Original Song.Sinners arrived with a soundtrack packed full of original tunes and fan favorites. Yet Warner Bros. ultimately selected just two tracks to represent the film at the Academy Awards: “I Lied to You” by Raphael Saadiq and Ludwig Göransson, and “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” co-written by Caton and Göransson. According to the Oscars rulebook, “No more than three songs from any one film may be submitted for Original Song, regardless of writer(s). ”That means Sinners had room to put up one more contender, but insiders believe the studio wanted to avoid splitting voter attention. Both submissions already feature in emotionally powerful moments: one fuels a barn-burning time-shifting sequence, while the other rolls into the film’s credits, giving Caton another shot at recognition to pair with his Best Supporting Actor buzz.Fans were quick to ask why Hailee Steinfeld’s track, written and performed for the soundtrack, wasn’t included. The Academy’s guidelines provide the answer: songs must have “a clearly audible, intelligible, substantive rendition… used in the body of the motion picture or as the first new music starts in the end credits.”Steinfeld’s song doesn’t meet that threshold within the movie itself, knocking it out of Oscars contention, at least for now. It may still qualify for other honors such as the Grammys’ visual media categories.While disappointed supporters believe “Hailee Steinfeld song should be up there” because it was “different,” the strategic choice suggests Warner Bros. is laser-focused on maximizing wins in a competitive season, especially with fierce rivals like One Battle After Another dominating predictions.With the race heating up and music emerging as a secret weapon, Sinners is still well positioned for Academy gold, even if one fan-favorite track remains just outside the Oscar spotlight.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld embraces a new digital chapter as she brings ‘Beau Society’ to Substack and reflects on new beginnings with Josh Allen","Only two tracks submitted for Best Original Song as strategy takes priority.

Apple is reportedly planning to roll out the iOS 26.1 update soon. While the official release date is not known yet, online rumours suggest that the upcoming iOS update may be introduced in early November. With the iOS 26.1 update, Apple is expected to bring a host of new features that may include an all-new Liquid Glass toggle, lock screen toggle, sony swipes in Apple Music and more. Here’s what we know about the iOS 26.1 so far – expected release date and features as rumoured online.Apple is yet to announce an iOS 26.1 Release Candidate – considered to be the final beta version before the wider rollout. Previous rumours hinted that the final beta of iOS 26.1 may be released in October. But it is now expected to come next month. In this case, iOS 26.1 is likely to be released next week with November 3 or November 4 as the expected dates.Apple has added a new customization option for the Liquid Glass interface in iOS 26.1.Users can now choose between two display styles under Settings → Display and Brightness → Liquid Glass — a more transparent Clear look or a slightly opaque Tinted one.A new setting under Settings → Lock Screen introduces the option to disable the quick swipe gesture that opens the Camera app. The toggle, labeled “Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera,” prevents accidental camera launches when swiping left on the Lock Screen.The Clock app has received a small but meaningful usability tweak. Instead of a single Stop button, iOS 26.1 introduces a new “slide to stop” gesture for turning off alarms and timers.This reduces the chance of accidentally dismissing alarms — an issue that emerged after Apple enlarged the stop button in earlier iOS 26 builds.iOS 26.1 brings a smoother music experience with song swiping in the Apple Music player. Users can now swipe left or right to skip tracks directly from the player interface.Following Apple’s recent announcement, iOS 26.1 incorporates the company’s new branding for its streaming service. Apple TV+ is now renamed Apple TV, featuring a more colorful app icon that reflects its “vibrant new identity.”Apple Intelligence expands its multilingual support with the addition of Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese (Portugal), Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (Traditional), and Vietnamese.This update makes Apple’s AI-driven features accessible to a wider global audience.The AirPods Live Translation feature now supports additional languages including Japanese, Korean, Italian, and both Traditional and Simplified Chinese.The feature is available on AirPods 4 with ANC, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3.Apple has introduced a new security feature under Settings → Privacy & Security → Security Improvements that automatically downloads and installs Background Security Improvements.These patches act as interim updates between major iOS releases, replacing the earlier Rapid Security Response mechanism to ensure faster protection against emerging threats.","iOS 26.1 is expected to be released next week with November 3 or November 4 as the expected dates.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

From streaming chaos to IMDb glory: IShowSpeed dethrones Leonardo DiCaprio on top trending celeb list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/from-streaming-chaos-to-imdb-glory-ishowspeed-dethrones-leonardo-dicaprio-on-top-trending-celeb-list/articleshow/124930003.cms,"YouTuber IShowSpeed beats Leonardo DiCaprio on IMDb’s top celeb list (Getty Images)

IShowSpeed climbs IMDb’s STARmeter rankings



Why IShowSpeed’s rise signals a new era







YouTube sensation Darren “IShowSpeed” Watkins Jr. has taken the internet by storm once again, but this time it’s not because of a wild livestream moment. The 20-year-old creator has climbed higher than Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio on IMDb’s list of top trending celebrities. The ranking, which changes weekly based on user searches, now places Speed among Hollywood’s most-searched names — an unexpected feat for a digital creator.According to IMDb’s STARmeter, which monitors how frequently personalities are searched, IShowSpeed’s name has surged across the platform. His sudden rise follows a streak of viral moments — from collaborations with global icons like Cristiano Ronaldo to streaming sessions with Kai Cenat. These appearances have not only boosted his online fame but also cemented his status as a pop culture phenomenon.Currently ranked just behind McKenna Grace, Rebecca Ferguson, and Charlie Hunnam, Speed’s climb is impressive considering IMDb traditionally spotlights actors, filmmakers, and TV personalities. For a YouTuber with minimal acting credits, reaching the top five underscores how drastically entertainment consumption has evolved.The growth of his fanbase has played a key role in this rise. IShowSpeed’s IMDb profile began as a small fan-made page listing him as an “actor” and “composer” for his own self-produced videos. Over time, fans added his iconic livestreams, viral clips, and humorous award nods as official entries.Each update sparked new searches, pushing his visibility further. His comedic “Early Stream!” sessions and meme-worthy clips like “IShowSpeed: Shake Pt. 2” have since become digital landmarks in internet culture.IShowSpeed’s momentum isn’t random. His recent viral moments — from teasing a Fortnite collaboration to pulling off record-breaking livestreams — have kept him trending across all platforms. His larger-than-life personality and unfiltered reactions have turned every appearance into an event. Just last week, a clip of him dragging a car went viral, reminding everyone why he continues to dominate social media conversation.Adding to his list of milestones, Speed’s “Early Stream” even earned a perfect 10-star rating on IMDb — a score higher than acclaimed TV classics like Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones.While Leonardo DiCaprio remains one of Hollywood’s most respected figures, IShowSpeed’s ascent marks a generational shift. The lines between traditional fame and digital stardom are blurring, and Speed’s climb proves that influence today is measured not by film credits but by connection, energy, and the ability to capture the world’s attention in real time.Also Read: Adin Ross makes a shocking confession about his deleted Donald Trump posts and the wild fallout that no one saw coming",Darren “IShowSpeed” Watkins Jr. has taken the internet by storm once again.

Saudi Arabia’s 'Stadium in the Sky' for 2034 FIFA World Cup: separating fact from fiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabias-stadium-in-the-sky-for-2034-fifa-world-cup-separating-fact-from-fiction/articleshow/124930769.cms,"The Fact: A NEOM stadium is planned — but not in the sky





FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

The Fiction: The viral “sky stadium” videos are AI-generated





Fact vs Fiction





The Bigger Picture





The Bottom Line









The internet can turn a concept sketch into a global sensation. In late October 2025, millions of people across X, TikTok, and YouTube watched a video showing what appeared to be a floating football stadium — a glowing bowl suspended 350 metres above the desert, nestled within Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city, NEOM: The Line. The captions were breathless: this was, they claimed, the NEOM Sky Stadium, a billion-dollar venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup.It looked like the future of football. It wasn’t.Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM. One of them, the NEOM Stadium, is described as being “more than 350 metres above ground level, within The Line.”That last phrase — “within The Line” — is what caused all the confusion.The stadium isn’t floating on a tower. It’s designed to be inside The Line’s vertical structure, part of a multi-level megacity that stacks entire neighbourhoods in layers. The stadium will occupy the fourth and fifth levels of this vast mirrored structure, making it high-altitude, but still fully enclosed.As ESPN reported, “the actual stadium proposed for construction in NEOM has been officially listed as one of the 15 host stadiums being either renovated or built from scratch for the FIFA 2034 World Cup for almost a year, and the Saudis do plan for it to be 350 metres above the ground.That is because they plan for it to form part of The Line, a proposed smart, green city in NEOM that will eventually extend in linear fashion for over 100 miles across the northwest Saudi province of Tabuk by 2045, powered entirely by renewable energy. ”Planned to seat around 46,000 spectators, the venue will be powered entirely by renewable energy and surrounded by a sports and wellness district, complete with hotels, apartments, and an electric transport network. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2027 and finish between 2032 and 2039, though The Line itself remains in its early stages of development.The viral clips of a glowing stadium hovering above the desert are not official footage. They were created by AI artists and CGI design accounts using programs such as Midjourney and Unreal Engine, taking NEOM’s futuristic imagery and exaggerating it for dramatic effect.Architectural analysts have pointed out the visual giveaways: lighting that doesn’t behave naturally, impossible reflections, and looping crowds that repeat in perfect synchrony. Even the drone-like camera sweeps in these videos defy real-world physics.NEOM’s official social media channels have not commented on these viral clips, and no government or FIFA outlet has ever released or endorsed them. The denials have instead come from journalists and design experts who confirmed that no such renders appear in the official World Cup bid or in NEOM’s verified materials.Several viral claims have blurred the line between fact and fantasy. The notion that Saudi Arabia is building a floating arena is false — official documents make clear the stadium is built within The Line’s vertical city, not on top of it. The circulating videos aren’t real construction footage; they’re AI-created visuals shared by fan-art accounts. Some users claimed Saudi officials had released these renders, but there’s no public statement or official post confirming or denying them. And despite online speculation, no construction has started; the project remains in its design phase, with The Line itself still under early development.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup forms part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a massive plan to transform the Kingdom into a global hub for sport, tourism, and technology. Projects such as The Line, Qiddiya, and New Murabba symbolise this futuristic ambition.Yet these megaprojects also face heavy criticism. Human-rights groups have documented forced evictions, executions of displaced tribespeople, and labour exploitation linked to NEOM’s construction. For many, the shimmering renderings of desert utopias mask a harsher reality on the ground.So while the AI-generated “stadium in the sky” dazzles online, the real story is more grounded — a mix of breathtaking ambition, architectural experimentation, and moral controversy.Saudi Arabia’s “Stadium in the Sky” exists only on screens. There is a NEOM Stadium planned for the 2034 World Cup — a high-altitude arena built within a vertical city, not floating above it. The viral clips showing a glowing bowl suspended over the desert are digital illusions, not construction updates. Like much of NEOM itself, the stadium represents a dream halfway between technology and theatre — where aspiration meets illusion, and the future of football is still being rendered.","Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM. One of them, the NEOM Stadium, is described as being ‘more than 350 metres above ground level, within The Line’ But the stadium isn’t floating on a tower, it’ll be inside The Line's vertical structure, part of a multi-level megacity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124930878,imgsize-138360,width-400,resizemode-4/renderings-of-the-neom-stadium.jpg"

UAE: Indian embassy announces three new Indian passport designs for residents with advanced security features,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-indian-embassy-announces-three-new-indian-passport-designs-for-residents-with-advanced-security-features/articleshow/124910973.cms,"UAE unveils three new Indian passport designs today / AI-generated illustration

Indian passport in UAE hits historic moment

What the three designs are and why it matters?

The older paper-based booklet (standard booklet issued before migration to machine-readable passports).



A machine-readable version with upgraded security features and newer cover design.



The latest e-passport series with an embedded chip and digital security, under the Passport Seva 2.0 rollout.



How it affects Indian expats in the UAE

What you should do now

Check which booklet series you hold and keep all pages in good condition (especially first and last pages).



When renewing, consider opting for the e-passport with a chip that offers longer validity, enhanced security, and easier travel clearance.



Retain copies (digital and paper) of your older passport if you are transitioning between designs, this helps avoid hiccups in sponsorship or residency records.



Stay tuned to official announcements from the Indian Embassy and Consulates in the UAE, changes to fees, booklet formats and services often come with some preparation time.







Indian expats in the UAE are witnessing a first-of-its-kind change, as the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi confirmed on October 28, 2025, that three different Indian passport designs are now officially in circulation the older booklet, the machine-readable version, and the newly introduced chip-enabled e-passport. The announcement marks a historic moment for the UAE’s Indian community, as the latest design under India’s Passport Seva 2.0 initiative brings enhanced security features, a smart embedded chip, and a refreshed visual layout, while older formats remain valid until expiry.Indian citizens residing in the UAE are now witnessing a unique first: three completely different Indian passport booklet designs in circulation at the same time. The development was reported by Gulf News, noting that expulsions of earlier classes and renewals mean holders could possess booklets of different series concurrently.Until recently, most Indian passport-holders abroad typically carried one design at a time: the older booklets, the newer machine-readable ones, or the latest biometric e-passports. But now, especially for the large Indian expatriate community in the UAE, all three are valid and in use.This arrangement creates both opportunity and confusion: renewal options, travel formalities, and verification processes may differ depending on which booklet a holder owns.The three designs currently in use include:For Indian expatriates in the UAE that means several practical implications: if you hold an older design passport you might face a different renewal fee, you may be required to convert to the new format sooner, and immigration authorities may ask for extra verification when travelling. Gulf News emphasised that all three booklets currently remain valid—but you must ensure your travel and visa arrangements recognise them.The Indian community in the UAE is among the world’s largest diaspora groups, making this passport transition especially significant. The rollout of the e-passport series coincides with the digitalisation of consular services at the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai, which announced new online portals and chip-embedded passports effective from 28 October 2025.For UAE-based Indian expats, key take-aways include: ensuring your passport booklet is valid for at least six months before travel; if you hold an older series consider upgrading to the e-passport to access newer services; keep an eye on renewal fee changes; and confirm that your visa or employer sponsorship remains valid even if your booklet changes design.If you’re an Indian passport-holder in the UAE:This simultaneous circulation of three passport designs may feel unusual, but it reflects India’s move toward technological and service upgrades for its global citizenry. For Indian expats in the UAE, it’s less about which booklet you hold and more about ensuring your travel, residency, and renewal documents remain valid and recognised. Secure your booklet, keep informed, and you’ll be ready for this new phase of passport evolution.","Indian citizens residing in the UAE are now witnessing a unique first: three completely different Indian passport booklet designs in circulation at the same time.

A castle’s hidden companion



From grape to glass: how the Romans made wine

A glimpse into late Roman life





Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a remarkably preserved 1,600-year-old Roman wine production site beneath the ruins of an ancient mountain castle. The discovery, made near the village of Oymakli in southeastern Turkey’s Kahta district, sheds light on the scale and sophistication of winemaking in the late Roman period. The site includes grape-crushing installations, cisterns, and grinding stones, all remarkably intact after more than a millennium. Experts believe the complex once operated as a large-scale industrial winery, serving both local residents and the nearby Kahta Castle, an important stronghold during the Kingdom of Commagene.The excavation, led by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, began after archaeologists discovered fragments of stone and pottery believed to be of historical value. The site spans nearly 37 acres and lies in a mountainous region overlooking the Euphrates River valley.Researchers found several installations used to crush grapes and channel juice into cisterns for fermentation and storage. Grinding stones and remnants of clay vessels suggest the factory also produced flour and possibly olive oil, hinting at a wider agricultural economy.According to Mehmet Alkan, provincial museum director, the site’s foundations survived “remarkably well” despite being built from irregular stones.“Its preservation offers an exceptional look into ancient craftsmanship and industrial-scale production,” he said.The ancient wineworks lie close to Kahta Castle, a fortress originally built in the 2nd century BC for the Kingdom of Commagene, a Greco-Iranian dynasty that thrived before Roman annexation. Archaeologists believe the site may have once served both as a production hub and as a residential settlement for those who worked at or supplied the castle.Given the castle’s position on a major trade route between Mesopotamia and Anatolia, experts say the winery could have played a key role in provisioning the garrison and exporting wine across the region. The discovery provides rare evidence of how local economies functioned under Roman rule in Anatolia’s remote mountain regions.The structures uncovered mirror other Roman-era wineries found across the Mediterranean. Grapes were likely pressed manually or with wooden beams, allowing juice to flow through carved channels into stone basins. From there, it would have been stored in large clay jars, or amphorae, to ferment.Archaeologists also uncovered cisterns carved directly into rock, which would have stored water essential for both winemaking and daily life in this dry region. The presence of such facilities suggests that the complex operated at an industrial scale, far beyond the needs of a single household.Dating to the 4th century AD, the site falls within a period when Christianity was spreading through the Roman Empire and Constantinople was emerging as its new capital. The discovery shows that even in remote provinces, life thrived through trade, agriculture, and craftsmanship.The blend of Roman engineering and local traditions in the architecture highlights the cultural fusion that defined this era. “This settlement reflects both Roman influence and Anatolian adaptation,” researchers noted in their preliminary report.","Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a remarkably preserved 1,600-year-old Roman wine production site beneath the ruins of an ancient mountain castle.

San Francisco wakes up to a surprising sight in the sky

Pathfinder 1 takes to the skies for key test flights over California



How Pathfinder 1 works: The technology behind the airship

A mysterious white airship floating silently over San Francisco has captivated global audiences, with viral videos and widespread speculation about its origin and purpose. Identified as Pathfinder 1, the massive craft is a groundbreaking creation by Lighter Than Air (LTA) Research , a company backed by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Far from being a publicity stunt, Pathfinder 1 represents a major leap in sustainable aviation technology. Designed to operate with zero emissions, it aims to revolutionise air travel and cargo transport by using helium for lift and electric propulsion for movement, showcasing a sustainable alternative to conventional aircraft technology. The airship’s recent flight over the Bay Area has sparked new interest in eco-friendly aviation and the potential return of lighter-than-air transport for the modern age.Early on Tuesday morning, residents of San Francisco, Oakland, and Alameda looked up in astonishment as a massive white airship glided slowly across the Bay Area. Videos shared online showed the smooth, silent craft drifting gracefully behind high-rises and over the waterfront, contrasting sharply with the usual hum of helicopters and airplanes.Content creator César Concepción Salza posted one of the first viral clips, asking, “What is this in the San Francisco sky today?” Within hours, his video spread rapidly across social media platforms, drawing both amazement and speculation.Some guessed it was part of a movie shoot, while others suspected a new government prototype. The truth, however, is far more visionary. The enormous white craft is called Pathfinder 1, an advanced prototype designed and operated by LTA Research, a company aiming to revive and modernise airship technology for the twenty-first century. Backed by Sergey Brin, LTA’s mission is to “launch the next generation of zero-emission airships” capable of transforming transport, logistics, and humanitarian aid.Unlike the commercial blimps often seen at sports events, Pathfinder 1 represents a complete reinvention. It combines cutting-edge materials, electric propulsion, and helium lift to create an aircraft that is not only visually impressive but also environmentally sustainable.According to official sources, Pathfinder 1 completed its first flight in May 2025 at Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California, a historic base once used for NASA research and military airships. The airship’s latest appearance over San Francisco marked another major test in its continuing flight programme, designed to evaluate navigation, altitude stability, and performance in real-world conditions.Observers across the Bay described the craft as a “gentle giant,” slowly manoeuvring through the sky with remarkable steadiness. Its sheer size estimated at about 124 metres (400 feet) long makes it one of the largest aircraft flying today. Sergey Brin’s involvement in LTA Research stems from his long-standing interest in sustainability and humanitarian innovation. The company’s objective is to design aircraft that can deliver cargo and aid without burning fossil fuels, especially to remote or disaster-stricken areas where conventional transport is limited.LTA’s research envisions a future fleet of helium-filled, electrically powered airships capable of carrying supplies, medical equipment, and even personnel across vast distances all while producing zero carbon emissions.Pathfinder 1 operates on the principle of lighter-than-air flight, using helium, which is a non-flammable, inert gas, to provide lift and maintain buoyancy at high altitudes. Its outer hull is made from advanced, lightweight materials designed for durability and weather resistance. Electric propellers allow for smooth, quiet propulsion, while onboard systems help stabilise flight paths and optimise energy use efficiently during extended operations.The craft’s design draws from both old and new engineering wisdom. While reminiscent of early-twentieth-century airships such as the Zeppelins, Pathfinder 1 integrates modern avionics, carbon-fibre frameworks, and sustainable power systems. These innovations make it far safer and cleaner than any of its historical predecessors.","A mysterious white airship floating silently over San Francisco has captivated global audiences.

Panic In Mississippi As Herpes-Infected Monkey Escapes Crash Scene And Evades Massive Police Hunt

Law enforcement vs. banana bandits







It was meant to be just another shipment, a truck rumbling down Interstate 59 with lab monkeys headed to a future full of medical tests, needles and white coats. But fate had other ideas. A sudden crash flipped the truck on its side, doors flew open, and the once-caged primates suddenly found themselves staring at the greatest opportunity of their furry lives. What began as a tragic highway accident became, for a handful of escape artists, a jailbreak dream come true. While officers panicked and residents locked their doors, the monkeys saw only one thing: freedom, as reported by the Mississippi Free Press.Residents who passed by the overturned truck witnessed scenes normally reserved for comedy films or escape-the-zoo memes. Monkeys leapt from the trailer, darting toward the woods with the kind of excitement that only comes from illegally skipping medical research duty. Officials urged everyone to stay far away, while the monkeys clearly preferred to play far away.Soon the highway became a primate-tracking battleground.Sheriff’s deputies, wildlife officers and highway patrol agents fanned out, radios crackling as they attempted to locate “five missing monkeys”. The fugitives were small, speedy and absolutely uninterested in human authority. Meanwhile, memes were already being drafted.Rumours spread that the monkeys were infectious with all sorts of terrifying diseases. Tulane University quickly stepped in to say: absolutely not. No viruses. No zombie outbreak. No Planet of the Apes Part One. Just regular lab monkeys who got a little too curious about roadside adventure.While the monkeys imagined a new start in the Mississippi wilderness, reality eventually caught up. Professional animal handlers arrived, armed not with fear but with food. The dramatic standoff ended, free-range monkey life lasted only hours, and the fugitives returned to captivity with incredible stories to tell their cage-mates.In the end, no humans were harmed and no contagious chaos broke out. But locals may be checking the trees for weeks, just in case another tiny escape artist decides to test their luck.","A truck carrying lab monkeys was overturned on Interstate 59 in Mississippi.

Expect to see rich, desert-inspired colors, finely carved wood, and beautiful ambient lighting from Murano glass that gives everything a golden glow.

glass that gives everything a golden glow. Dining is a Destination: Forget tiny airplane meals. This train features two separate restaurant cars that aim for a Michelin-level standard of cuisine. You get to choose between savoring authentic local Saudi cuisine or indulging in refined international menus with an Italian twist.

Socializing: If you want to meet fellow travelers, the central Majlis lounge is the perfect spot. It’s inspired by the traditional Saudi gathering space, offering a comfortable and elegant place to relax and enjoy the ride.





Have you heard the buzz? Saudi Arabia isn't just building futuristic cities; they're launching a legendary way to see the country! It's called the 'Dream of the Desert,' and trust me, this isn't your average train ride, it’s the Middle East's first five-star luxury train, and it’s going to redefine desert travel.“Dream of the Desert” is Saudi Arabia’s new ultra-luxury train project designed as a moving palace, part hotel, part restaurant, part cultural showcase. It’s being built by Italy’s Arsenale Group in partnership with Saudi Arabia Railways and several Saudi authorities as part of the kingdom’s push to expand high-end tourism under Vision 2030The ‘Dream of the Desert’ project was officially announced in Riyadh by Saudi Arabia Railways (SAR) in collaboration with Italy’s Arsenale Group, the company behind several luxury train and hospitality concepts worldwide. The announcement was made as part of Saudi Arabia’s ongoing push to elevate tourism and luxury travel offerings under the Vision 2030 strategy.Senior SAR officials, along with Arsenale’s leadership, revealed key details of the project, highlighting Saudi Arabia’s ambition to bring a world-class rail tourism experience to the region for the first time. The announcement also emphasized how the train will blend Saudi heritage, high-end hospitality, and slow-travel luxury, catering to both international tourists and premium local travellers.The journey itself is designed to be an immersive exploration of the Kingdom, not just a quick ride. The trip will last for either one or two nights, giving you enough time to truly relax and soak in the views.You'll depart from the dynamic capital city of Riyadh and travel approximately 1,300 kilometers across Saudi Arabia’s historic Northern Railway network. The itinerary is set to include culturally rich regions like Al Qassim and Hail, places that were vital hubs on ancient trade routes. The journey is planned to conclude at Al-Qurayyat, near the Jordanian border.The best part? This experience isn't only about the train. They are partnering with the Ministry of Culture to offer curated cultural programs and unique excursions. Think of visits to ancient sites and authentic local experiences, all included in your trip.The big question everyone asks is about the cost. Since official ticket prices haven't been released, we have to look at what other comparable luxury trains charge to get a reasonable estimate. This train is being positioned as ""ultra-luxury,"" meaning it aims to compete with the world's best.Based on similar international experiences, like the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express or luxury rail journeys in Africa and Asia, you should be prepared to budget for a significant cost. For the one- to two-night journey, expect the price per person to fall within the range of $3,000 to over $5,000 (USD), possibly more for the highly exclusive Presidential Suites.Prepare to feel completely spoiled. The 'Dream of the Desert' is incredibly exclusive, with just 66 guests allowed on board at any time.So, when can you actually go? The excitement is building because the train is expected to begin its first journeys towards the end of 2026. Yes, it's a bit of a wait, but this gives you plenty of time to save up for what is clearly going to be a once-in-a-lifetime trip.","‘Dream of the Desert’ is Saudi Arabia’s new ultra-luxury train project designed as a moving palace, part hotel, part restaurant, part cultural showcase.

Why the upgrade matters









The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have announced the rollout of a new digital passport system for Indian citizens in the UAE. Starting from 28 October 2025, all applicants will receive chip-embedded e-passports under the upgraded Global Passport Seva Programme (GPSP 2.0) — a step designed to make passport services faster, safer and globally compliant.The GPSP 2.0 rollout is part of the Indian government’s effort to modernise passport services for citizens abroad. Starting 28 October 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE — including new passports, renewals, and other related services — must be submitted through the upgraded online portal:At the centre of this upgrade is the introduction of e-passports, each embedded with a secure microchip that stores digitised personal data of the passport holder. The embedded chip conforms to international biometric passport standards, designed to ensure smoother and faster immigration clearance across global checkpoints.This digital enhancement brings Indian passports in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s benchmarks for biometric and machine-readable travel documents. The same ICAO standards also now apply to passport photographs — a requirement that has been in force for Indian expats in the UAE since 1 September 2025.The Indian missions in the UAE have outlined a detailed process for applying under the new system:The upgraded system offers several user-friendly improvements intended to make the passport process faster and more efficient:For the large Indian expatriate community in the UAE — one of the biggest overseas Indian populations in the world — this transition to e-passports represents a major step forward in security, efficiency, and global mobility. The embedded-chip passports align India’s travel documents with international standards, improving authentication and reducing risks of tampering or duplication.By digitising more critical stages of the application process, GPSP 2.0 not only significantly reduces paperwork and waiting time but also ensures a more secure and transparent experience for applicants. For Indian missions in the UAE, it further simplifies backend operations and ensures greater data consistency across systems.As the new system officially takes effect from 28 October 2025, both the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have strongly urged applicants to familiarise themselves early with the updated procedures and to transition smoothly to the enhanced GPSP 2.0 platform.","The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai have announced the rollout of a new digital passport system for Indian citizens in the UAE.

Visa runs are a legitimate and convenient way to extend your UAE stay. By exiting to Oman or nearby countries and re-entering, you get a fresh visa stamp, allowing for a continued stay. Multiple service providers operate daily, offering both border and airport-based options. Ensure you're eligible, have all required documents, and plan ahead to avoid penalties.In the UAE, overstaying your visa comes with clear consequences , and a daily price tag. Once your visa expires, and you're beyond any grace period, you're subject to a fine of AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day. In addition, you’ll need to pay an exit permit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when you leave. These penalties apply across the board, whether you’re on a visit visa, a tourist visa, or a residency visa.To avoid those penalties and remain in the country legally, many visitors turn to a well-established and structured option: the visa run.A visa run is the process of strategically leaving the UAE temporarily and re-entering, typically on the same day, in order to reset your visa status and legally extend your stay.It’s most commonly used by those who entered on a 30- or 90-day tourist or visit visa and need more time without switching to a long-term visa.This method doesn't violate any immigration rules. In fact, it operates entirely within the framework of UAE border control and is widely recognized as a legitimate solution for visitors and temporary residents needing more time in the country.Most visa runs are made to neighboring Oman, given its proximity and straightforward land border access from Dubai and other Emirates. Others may involve flying to nearby countries, depending on visa status, timing, or agency arrangements.The process is especially useful for:For nationalities that receive a visa on arrival, this can be a remarkably smooth process, often involving just a short trip to the border, then re-entering the UAE on a renewed entry stamp.Visa runs are a smart solution, but not a free-for-all. They're especially practical for travelers from countries that are eligible for 30-day visa on arrival in the UAE. These travelers can often exit and re-enter without any pre-approval, making the process both fast and relatively low-cost.Here’s a list of nationalities that currently benefit from the 30-day renewable visa on arrival and are eligible for UAE-Oman visa run services:Additional eligible countries include Uzbekistan and Mongolia. If your country is on this list, you are eligible to enter the UAE multiple times with a new visa issued upon each arrival, provided your documents are in order.It’s worth noting that border visa runs are typically limited to three consecutive renewals. After reaching this limit, you may want to explore alternatives like the airport-to-airport (A2A) visa switch or returning to your home country to renew or apply for a new visa. Some agencies also offer visa change flights to nearby destinations like Bahrain or Kuwait. Always remember, immigration officials have discretion and may deny entry if they suspect the system is being misused or if your stay doesn’t appear genuine.The UAE–Oman border is by far the most popular and practical route for visa runs, especially for travelers holding 30-day visa-on-arrival eligibility. Located about 140 km from Downtown Dubai, roughly a 1 hour 40 minute drive, this border crossing offers a convenient way to extend your stay legally without overstaying your visa. Multiple agencies run daily roundtrip services from Dubai to Oman, making it a dependable and widely used option for visa renewals.Since August 2024, nationals from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand receive a 90-day visa on arrival, valid over a 180-day period. After using these 90 days, re-entry on arrival is not possible until the next cycle; a pre-approved visa would be required to enter the UAE.That’s where visa runs or visa changes come in. Visa run services offer early morning (around 7 AM) bus trips to Oman (via Hatta or Al Ain–Buraimi), handling all visa paperwork. The package typically includes an express 60-day visa, return transport to Oman, and hotel accommodation during visa processing. You can relax while your visa is approved and return to the UAE by late afternoon (around 5 PM) with your fresh visa, all within the same day.If you're applying for your Omani entry visa yourself instead of going through an agency, you can do this easily through the Royal Oman Police (ROP) website. Select the unsponsored 26A visa, a 10-day tourist visa, upload a scanned passport and photo, and pay the 5 Omani Rial (~AED 48) fee. Processing time ranges from a couple of hours to up to three days. Once approved, print your e-visa and carry a hard copy with you on the trip.In addition to the service fee, budget for:This method is one of the most cost-effective and time-saving visa renewal strategies, provided you're from an eligible nationality and have all documentation in place. It's widely used by tourists, freelancers, job seekers, and anyone in transition to residency.Another option, particularly when land runs are not ideal or permitted due to visa rules, is the airport-to-airport visa run. This involves flying out of the UAE, to Oman, Bahrain, or Kuwait, for example, and returning with a new visa arranged in advance.While this option may require an overnight stay, depending on visa processing times, it’s often used by travelers whose nationality doesn’t qualify for a visa on arrival.This method is especially common when border runs are no longer allowed due to visa count or policy updates.Whether you’re going by road or air, here are the essentials:Though not mandatory, travel and health insurance covering both the UAE and Oman is highly recommended for any visa run.Several agencies in the UAE have made visa runs hassle-free by offering full-service packages that include transportation, coordination, and support:Both providers emphasize planning your visa run at least five days before your current visa expires, allowing ample time to avoid penalties or issues.Visa runs can often offer a clear, legal, and practical way to conveniently extend your stay in the UAE without breaking any rules. When done carefully through proper channels, with the right documentation, timing, and a full understanding of your specific eligibility, they serve as a valuable temporary bridge between short-term visits and more permanent residency arrangements.They're not a workaround or a grey area. They are a recognized tool in the UAE’s flexible visa framework, especially for tourists, job seekers, freelancers, and families who need more time, and who want to do it the right way.Just remember:And with that, you’ll find that staying longer in the UAE can be as straightforward as a bus ride to the border, and back again.Yes, visa runs are legal and operate within UAE’s border control system, as long as you follow the rules and have the correct documentation.The cost starts at AED 440 (~USD 120) for a border visa run and AED 1250 (~USD 340) for a 60-day visa extension with hotel accommodation.You’ll need a valid passport, passport copy, current UAE entry stamp, photo, and potentially car documents or a guarantor, depending on your situation.Border visa runs typically take one day, leave early morning and return by late afternoon. Airport-based runs may take 1–2 days.Border visa runs are generally limited to three consecutive times. After that, you’ll need to explore alternatives like an airport-to-airport visa switch.If you're using the border visa run option, no pre-approval is needed for most nationalities. For other visa options, you may need to pre-arrange the visa.You’ll be fined AED 50 (~USD 13.60) per day plus an exit fee of AED 250–350 (~USD 68–95) when leaving the UAE.","Visa runs are a widely practiced and accepted method used by tourists, job seekers, and remote workers to legally extend their stay in the UAE without overstaying.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country. The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.

Why Zohran Mamdani's aunt is a topic of discussion



Mamdani Under FIRE After Resurfaced NYPD–IDF Conspiracy Video Shocks Voters | WATCH





After New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani clarified that the 9/11 anecdote was not about his Masuma Mamdani , his father's sister, but someone called Zehra Fui who was his father's cousin and is not alive any more, a new debate started on social media delving into who all brown people address as aunts. ""Your 'father's cousin' is not your aunt,"" New York Post's Miranda Devine wrote, only to receive a strong pushback from many Asian-origin commentators that a father's cousin is indeed an aunt.In a recent speech where Mamdani spoke about Islamophobia, Mamdani said his aunt felt unsafe in her hijab in the US after 9/11. The comment became a laughing stock for MAGA as they derided how Mamdani made 9/11 about his family, projecting his aunt as the real victim of 9/11.MAGA supporters delved deep and then found out that Mamdani's aunt Masuma Mamdani did not even live in the US during 9/11 and does not wear hijab in any of the publicly available photos. Mamdani was called a liar for cooking up a false story about his aunt.""I was speaking about my aunt, Zehra Fuhi, my father's cousin who sadly passed away a few years ago, and for the takeaway from my more-than-10-minute address about Islamophobia in this city to be the question of my aunt tells you everything about Andrew Cuomo and his inability to recon his crisis,"" Mamdani clarified.A major social media debate erupted over whether a father's cousin can be called an aunt, with Mehdi Hasan pitching in and speaking for all the brown people that a parent's cousin is indeed an aunt. Sana Ebrahimi, a social media user who first called out Mamdani for lying about his aunt, slammed Mehdi Hasn and claimed that Iranians do not call their parents cousins, uncles or aunts -- there are separate terms, but that claim too came under attack.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani made a 9/11 anecdote about his aunt.

The most advanced innovation revealed X-BAT, an AI-piloted, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) fighter jet built for expeditionary and maritime operations. This next-generation aircraft has been meticulously designed to operate effectively in highly contested environments where communications are denied, degraded, or limited, ensuring mission success even in the harshest and most unpredictable combat conditions worldwide.Unveiled at an event in Washington, D.C., before top military officials, defence experts, and industry partners, the X-BAT represents a significant technological leap forward in modern air combat capabilities. It is not just another drone or unmanned aircraft; it is a symbol of how artificial intelligence is reshaping military aviation by offering operational independence, adaptability, and precision without relying on conventional runways or continuous human control, setting a bold new benchmark for autonomous defence innovation.According to Brandon Tseng, Shield AI’s co-founder, president, and a former Navy SEAL, the company’s vision is rooted in the belief that “the greatest victory requires no war.” This philosophy underscores Shield AI’s long-term mission to use intelligent systems to deter conflict rather than escalate it.Tseng explained that the X-BAT represents the next strategic phase in the company’s “master plan” to demonstrate the true value of autonomy, expand it across multiple military domains, and ultimately reinvent the concept of airpower.He described X-BAT as a transformative aircraft capable of operating entirely without runways. This independence offers military forces the ability to take off and land from ships, islands, or rough terrain, significantly increasing operational reach. “Airpower without runways is the holy grail of deterrence,” Tseng said. “It gives our forces persistence, reach, and survivability, and it buys diplomacy another day. ”At the centre of X-BAT’s innovation is Hivemind, Shield AI’s proprietary autonomy software. Hivemind is the digital “brain” that allows the aircraft to think, plan, and act on its own in environments where communication links might be disrupted or unavailable. Traditional drones rely heavily on constant operator input and GPS signals. In contrast, X-BAT can navigate, make tactical decisions, and complete missions independently. This capability allows the aircraft to penetrate deeply contested airspace where human pilots or remote-control systems would be at risk.According to Shield AI, Hivemind enables X-BAT to perform several key functions:This AI-driven autonomy makes X-BAT a self-reliant combat asset capable of executing high-stakes missions even when communication or GPS support is unavailable.Armor Harris, senior vice president of aircraft at Shield AI, described X-BAT as “a revolution in airpower.” He explained that its groundbreaking performance is built upon four core pillars: vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), long operational range, multirole versatility, and true autonomy.These combined capabilities allow the aircraft to overcome many of the limitations faced by traditional fighter jets. VTOL functionality eliminates dependence on airstrips, giving X-BAT the ability to operate from small ships or remote areas. Its long range extends mission reach far beyond typical drone operations. The multirole configuration allows the aircraft to seamlessly switch between different mission types — from offensive strikes to reconnaissance or electronic warfare. Finally, its autonomous software ensures that the aircraft can perform effectively with minimal human intervention, even in chaotic or isolated environments.Harris further noted that X-BAT’s design solves several long-standing challenges in modern air combat, such as survivability on the ground and reliance on tanker aircraft for refuelling. Its flexibility allows it to maintain effectiveness even when initial plans are disrupted, making it a truly adaptive combat tool.X-BAT is not just technologically impressive; it is built for real-world combat effectiveness. Every element of its engineering serves to balance power, survivability, and cost-efficiency in a way that enhances operational outcomes.Unlike traditional jets that require long runways, X-BAT can take off vertically and still achieve a range of more than 2,000 nautical miles while carrying a full mission payload. This makes it ideal for large-scale operations that launch from naval vessels, small islands, or improvised airfields.X-BAT can perform a wide array of missions including air-to-ground strikes, counter-air defence, electronic warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). This versatility reduces the need for multiple specialised aircraft, saving both resources and logistics complexity.Its small footprint allows up to three X-BAT aircraft to occupy the same space needed for a single legacy fighter or helicopter. This dramatically increases sortie generation rates, mission tempo, and deployment efficiency.The aircraft uses a fighter-class engine already proven in military operations. This ensures high reliability and easier maintenance, leveraging existing logistics systems and parts supply chains.X-BAT is built to provide fifth-generation fighter performance at a fraction of the acquisition and lifecycle cost. Its attritable design philosophy means it can be deployed aggressively without the prohibitive expenses associated with traditional fighters.Through a combination of stealth features, autonomous decision-making, and adaptive mission strategies, X-BAT can survive and succeed in highly contested environments where human pilots might face unacceptable risks.X-BAT’s modular software and open architecture make it compatible with existing and future Air Force and Navy systems. This design flexibility ensures the aircraft can evolve with emerging defence technologies and concepts, including distributed combat operations.","Shield AI has unveiled the X-BAT, an AI-piloted VTOL fighter jet designed for contested environments.

White House and GameStop trade Trump and JD Vance Halo memes — and gamers aren’t amused,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-and-gamestop-trade-trump-and-jd-vance-halo-memes-and-gamers-arent-amused/articleshow/124875267.cms,"Vance Defends Trump’s Meme War On Jeffries — Racist or Funny? America Stunned Amid Shutdown





In a bizarre mix of politics and gaming culture, the Trump administration’s social media team spent Sunday evening exchanging Halo memes with GameStop.It began when the White House’s official X account posted an AI-generated image of President Donald Trump dressed as Halo’s main character, Master Chief, standing before the White House and an altered American flag missing ten stars. The image was captioned “Power to the Players,” seemingly a nod to GameStop’s slogan.Gamers were quick to roast the post, calling it “AI slop” and accusing the White House of missing the point of the game entirely. Master Chief, the protagonist of Halo, is a genetically enhanced supersoldier who protects humanity from alien threats. Others mocked the attempt to appeal to gamers, saying it “completely misses the point of Halo.”The meme was actually a response to GameStop’s earlier viral post announcing the “official cessation of console wars,” after Microsoft confirmed a surprise remake of Halo: Combat Evolved would also arrive on Sony’s PlayStation 5 in 2026. GameStop styled its post as a diplomatic statement urging “console loyalists” to “cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming.”Not long after, the White House joined in, and GameStop fired back.The retailer posted its own image showing Trump as Master Chief and Vice President JD Vance as Cortana, the game’s AI companion. The image appeared to be edited from Trump’s mug shot and a meme of Vance with a bloated face, which made the exchange viral.“President Trump presides over the end of the 20-year Console Wars,” the White House joked in one reply. GameStop later added an image of Trump shaking hands with Master Chief.GameStop’s stock briefly surged 7.7 per cent on Monday before dipping again, prompting comparisons to the 2021 meme stock craze. The company denied coordinating with the Trump administration, though CEO Ryan Cohen, a known Trump supporter, re-posted the Halo memes on his own account.The online banter reignited debate over how the Trump administration uses pop culture to promote its agenda. Recently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was criticised for using the Pokémon theme in a border enforcement video.Video game analyst Daniel Ahmad also weighed in, saying Trump’s Halo meme was “tone-deaf,” especially given that Trump’s tariffs have been blamed for console price hikes across the industry.","The White House's official X account posted an AI-generated image of President Donald Trump dressed as Halo’s main character, Master Chief, standing before the White House and an altered American flag missing ten stars.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Pensioners play a vital role in the social fabric of our society, and their financial security is paramount. To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Immediate limits:

Age verification:





Character.AI, the Google-backed artificial intelligence (AI) startup, has said that it will shut off the ability for minors to have open-ended conversations with its AI chatbots, including romantic and therapeutic chats, following the suicide of a teenager who formed relationships with characters on its platform. The Silicon Valley company, which allows users to create and interact with character-based chatbots, said the move is part of an effort to make its app safer and more age-appropriate for users under 18.The announcement comes more than a year after 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III committed suicide after forming what his family described as sexual relationships with chatbots on Character.AI's app. Sewell's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company in October 2024.“This is a bold step forward, and we hope this raises the bar for everybody else,” CNBC cited Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand as saying.As part of its safety initiatives, Character.AI announced several measures:Starting immediately, users under 18 will be limited to two hours of open-ended chats per day.By November 25, those types of conversations will be eliminated entirely for minors, though they will still have access to the app's other offerings including storytelling and roleplay formats.The company is rolling out an age assurance function using first-party and third-party software to monitor users' ages. Character.AI is partnering with Persona—the same verification firm used by Reddit and other platforms—to help with verification.The tragedy is part of a broader pattern raising concerns about AI chatbots. Many AI developers, including OpenAI and Meta (Facebook's parent company), have faced scrutiny after users committed suicide or died after forming relationships with chatbots.Character.AI was founded by Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, both former Google AI researchers. In August 2024, Google hired the company’s co-founders. Character.AI licensed its current large language model (LLM) technology to Google as part of the agreement. Shazeer returned to Google DeepMind as a co-lead for the Gemini model.Last week, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said that the company will not provide “simulated erotica” and called such chatbots “very dangerous.”","Character.AI, the Google-backed artificial intelligence startup, has said that it will shut off the ability for minors to have open-ended conversations with its AI chatbots.
