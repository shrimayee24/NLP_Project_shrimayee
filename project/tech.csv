World’s longest road tunnel takes drivers on a 20-minute journey without daylight beneath Norway’s mountains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-longest-road-tunnel-takes-drivers-on-a-20-minute-journey-without-daylight-beneath-norways-mountains/articleshow/127533646.cms,"AI Generated

The Laerdal Tunnel: Longest road tunnel designed for drivers in Norway



How the Lærdal Tunnel’s lighting reduces driver fatigue





Advanced safety features inside the Lærdal Tunnel







Traveling through tunnels is usually just a normal part of a trip, but the Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is something special. The tunnel is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie. Drivers can go through the tunnel for up to 20 minutes without ever seeing the sun. The tunnel connects the towns of Laerdal and Aurland. It is an important way to get from Oslo in the east to Bergen in the west. Every year, thousands of people who work, visit, or move goods through the tunnel. The tunnel is not just a way to get from one place to another. People all over the world call it an engineering marvel because of its size, shape, and usefulness, which make it easy for people to get around. It shows that infrastructure can put people first, even when the ground is hard to work with.According to The Sun reports, after about five years of building, the Laerdal Tunnel opened in November 2000. It cost 1.08 billion Norwegian kroner, which is about £80 million. It goes through a mountain range with peaks that are 1,400 meters high, making it the longest road tunnel in the world. Engineers had to make sure that the structure was safe and that drivers could drive comfortably over such a long underground stretch without losing their focus or getting lost.Unlike most tunnels, Laerdal is not a boring tube. The design shows that the people who made it knew that people can get bored in long, closed spaces. To fix this, the tunnel has sections that are wider and more like caves at regular intervals. These parts give drivers a break from the view and a place to pull over.A big new feature of the Laerdal Tunnel is its innovative lighting system. The lights are warm blue and orange tones that illuminate different areas instead of relying on a long, monotonous strip of white fluorescent lights. These creatively coloured rooms make the drive less boring and visually stimulating, which helps keep drivers from getting tired, drowsy, or distracted and encourages them to stay awake and alert. Some of these rooms are spacious enough for cars to park safely and comfortably. This thoughtful design gives long-haul drivers or anyone who is tired a chance to take a short rest break, stretch, and rejuvenate before moving on. The tunnel makes the long underground passage safer, more comfortable, and remarkably unique, creating a one-of-a-kind experience for all drivers passing through.Safety has always been the most important thing in the Laerdal Tunnel. The tunnel has a modern ventilation system that makes sure the air is clean and easy to breathe the whole way through. Fifteen cameras watch traffic and accidents so that help can be sent right away if needed. If there is an accident, automated systems can quickly close the tunnel to stop other problems from happening.There are also safety points every 500 meters that include fire extinguishers, emergency phones, and other critical safety equipment. This is important because it means that drivers can get help right away if they need it. The Laerdal Tunnel is not only the longest road tunnel in the world, but it is also one of the safest. Everyone knows the Lærdal Tunnel as a tourist attraction and as a practical road. Many reviews mention how beautiful the colored tunnels are and how cool it is to drive through the mountains for 20 minutes. Those who visit the tunnel often say that they are always amazed by how large and well-constructed it is. Some even say that it feels more like an adventure than a ride.The tunnel itself is a reason for people who have never visited Norway to visit the country. It proves how much Norway is interested in new ideas, in building, and in making driving easier.","The Laerdal Tunnel in Norway is 15.2 miles long and goes under a mountain range that looks like it came straight out of a movie.

WhatsApp security under lens: Elon Musk and Telegram CEO Pavel Durov criticizes WhatsApp as Meta faces lawsuit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-says-have-to-be-braindead-to-believe-whatsapp-is-secure/articleshow/127595598.cms,"Elon Musk criticizes Meta's WhatsApp

Head of WhatsApp Will Cathcart’s response to the allegations

Lawsuit filed against WhatsApp

What Meta said





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has said that an individual has to be “braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure”. The Russian billionaire’s comments come amid a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp in San Francisco, accusing it of accessing users' messages, contradicting end-to-end encryption (E2EE) promises. “You’d have to be braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure in 2026. When we analyzed how WhatsApp implemented its “encryption”, we found multiple attack vectors,” Pavel Durov wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).In the post, Durov cited Telegram's internal analysis revealing unspecified ""attack vectors"" in WhatsApp's encryption implementation, though no public details have emerged, while WhatsApp's Signal Protocol has undergone independent audits confirming default E2EE.Telegram CEO was joined by Elon Musk in criticizing the instant messaing app. The Tesla CEO shared a post on X writing ""WhatsApp is not secure. Even Signal is questionable. Use X Chat."" Musk was responding to a post by DogeDesigner that quoted Bloomberg report about the lawsuit against Meta.WhatsApp head Will Cathcart took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his response on the allegations. He wrote, ""This is totally false.WhatsApp can’t read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don’t have access to them. This is a no-merit, headline-seeking lawsuit brought by the very same firm defending NSO after their spyware attacked journalists and government officials.""As reported by Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for Northern California. It challenges Meta’s marketing of E2EE feature, a security standard which the company claims protects the messages on the app and ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message.The lawsuit claims that Meta’s privacy claims are false as the company WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”. The plaintiffs represented users from India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa. It also alleges that the company retains the ability to decrypt and review the substance of messages for data analysis and internal monitoring.Calling the allegations “frivolous” and “absurd,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs’ counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false. WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction,"" Stone said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has said that an individual has to be “braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure” The Russian billionaire’s comments come amid a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp in San Francisco, accusing it of accessing users' messages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127595568,imgsize-17840,width-400,resizemode-4/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-says-have-to-be-braindead-to-believe-whatsapp-is-secure.jpg"

Today’s Wordle Answer

FREAK





Wordle has moments when instinct takes over and confidence wanes. That wait tends to occur today. The puzzle doesn't rush you, but it also doesn't tolerate taking quick cuts. It's possible for early guesses to appear beneficial before subtly blocking better options. The arrangement is more important than normal, but the letters feel familiar and nearly evident. Flashy risks and smart openings are not appropriate now. It requires self-control and focus, rewarding players who notice what's missing as well as what's there. It makes sense if you have been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. Until the framework aligns, the solution is still elusive. A few well-chosen cues can help bring the word into focus and stabilise the situation.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1682 on January 26, 2026, is:Meaning: A person, animal or event extremely unusual or unlikely, and not like any other of its type.Whether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Tech leaders like Elon Musk and Pavel Durov also expressed skepticism, highlighting potential security flaws in the popular messaging app.

Meta denies allegations, calls lawsuit 'frivolous fiction'

Elon Musk , Paul Durov question WhatsApp's security claims





Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding WhatsApp's encryption claims, pointing to a fundamental conflict of interest in Meta's advertising-driven business model.His comments come after a lawsuit was filed in a US district court in San Francisco on Friday, accusing Meta of misleading billions of WhatsApp users about their privacy. The plaintiffs, from countries including Australia, India, Mexico, and South Africa, claim the company's end-to-end encryption is essentially a facade.""As a general principle, when you rely on ads based on user habits, privacy can never be the first priority. The conflict of interest is real and serious,"" Vembu wrote on X. He added that when public market pressure demands ever-greater profits to justify ""astronomical valuations,"" it becomes ""naive to assume that these companies will put user privacy first.""Meta has pushed back hard against the accusations. Communications director Andy Stone called the claims ""categorically false and absurd,"" stating that WhatsApp has used Signal protocol encryption for a decade.The company warned it plans to seek sanctions against the plaintiffs' lawyers.The lawsuit cites unnamed whistleblowers who allegedly reveal that Meta employees can request access to user messages through an internal system. According to the complaint, workers need only submit a task request to the engineering team, which grants access ""often without any scrutiny at all.""The controversy has drawn reactions from across the tech industry. Elon Musk warned users against WhatsApp, calling it insecure and even questioning Signal's reliability. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was characteristically blunt: ""You'd have to be braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure in 2026."" He claimed that Telegram's analysis of WhatsApp's encryption implementation revealed ""multiple attack vectors.""The 51-page lawsuit alleges that once Meta workers gain access, they can view messages in real-time through a widget, with no separate decryption required. Messages reportedly appear commingled with content from unencrypted sources, accessible from the moment users first activated their accounts.Vembu's critique stands out because it doesn't focus on technical specifics. Instead, he highlights the structural problem: a company that makes money by tracking user behaviour will always face pressure to prioritise data collection over privacy. His own company, Zoho, operates on a subscription model without advertising.The lawsuit is seeking class-action status and damages. Meta, meanwhile, has not issued a formal public statement beyond calling the legal action a ""frivolous work of fiction.""","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu questions WhatsApp's privacy claims, citing Meta's ad- driven model as a conflict of interest.

Minecraft has released a new snapshot update that brings fresh gameplay ahead of its next major drop. The Minecraft 26.1 snapshots update also brings changes to baby mobs, items and technical systems, while also introducing a new craftable item that gives players more control over mob growth. With updated visuals, new sounds, and deeper customization options, the snapshot allows players to test features that may shape future releases. The changes are now available for testing, giving players an early look at what is coming next to the sandbox game. “With today's snapshot release, we're bringing you another set of features from our next game drop!,” Minecraft said in the official post, adding “Dive into testing with new versions of aquatic baby mobs and discover eternal youth! Making big waves for looking adorably tiny are new baby versions of the axolotl, dolphin, turtle, squid, and glow squid. Don't want them to grow up? Feed your favorite baby mobs a golden dandelion to keep them young forever.”One of the key additions in the snapshot is the introduction of new baby versions of aquatic mobs. Players can now find baby axolotls, dolphins, turtles, squids, and glow squids in the game. These baby mobs come with updated models and textures, making them visually distinct from their adult versions. Mojang has also adjusted the bounding boxes for baby squid, glow squid, and axolotl so they better match their new models.The update also adds a new item called the Golden Dandelion. This flower can be crafted using a regular dandelion and gold nuggets. When a player interacts with a baby mob while holding a Golden Dandelion, the mob’s aging process stops. Using the item again on the same mob will allow it to resume growing. The Golden Dandelion cannot be used on hostile baby mobs or villagers.In addition, baby chickens now have new sounds, adding more variation to in-game audio.Updated the models and textures of the following baby mobs:Increased the bounding box of baby Squid to better fit the new modelIncreased the bounding box of baby Glow Squid to better fit the new modelIncreased the bounding box of baby Axolotl to better fit the new model","Minecraft Snapshots 26.1 brings new baby mobs and Golden Dandelion.

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

"Sweden unearths a 5,000-year-old dog buried with a dagger, hints at elite treatment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/sweden-unearths-a-5000-year-old-dog-buried-with-a-dagger-hints-at-elite-treatment/articleshow/127505466.cms,"The ‘ dog burial ’ that stopped archaeologists in their tracks

What the dagger reveals about the burial

What archaeologists hope to learn next





Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: The well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago alongside a carefully crafted dagger made from bone. The burial was found in a wetland that was once a lake, a setting that helped protect fragile remains for millennia. What makes the find so fascinating is how deliberate it appears. This was not a random deposit or scattered bones. The placement suggests intention, meaning, and possibly even ceremony. To researchers, the message is clear: This dog may have been valued far beyond an ordinary animal.The dog’s skeleton was found in remarkably good condition, especially for something this old. It was uncovered by archaeologists from Arkeologerna, a unit within Sweden’s National Historical Museums, during an excavation at Logsjomossen near Jarna linked to construction work for the Ostlanken railway project. Because the burial lay in waterlogged sediments from what was once a lake, the wetland environment helped preserve fragile organic remains far better than normal soil would. What struck researchers immediately was how intentional it looked, as if someone had carefully placed the dog there rather than leaving it behind as simple waste.Alongside the dog was a polished bone dagger, described as long and finely made. In prehistoric societies, objects like this were not casual possessions. A blade tool could represent skill, status, or even symbolic meaning, depending on the culture and context.The fact that it was placed with the dog suggests the animal had significance. The dagger may have been a grave gift, a sign of honour, or something meant to accompany the dog in death.Dogs in the Stone Age were not only companions. They could be protectors, hunting partners, trackers, and vital members of daily survival. A strong, reliable dog might have been seen as part of the group’s success, especially in harsh environments where every advantage mattered.A careful burial could reflect gratitude, respect, or an emotional bond. It may also indicate that this dog held a special role, possibly linked to hunting, guarding, or ritual significance in the community.The burial was found in sediments that once sat at the bottom of a shallow lake. That detail matters because water and wetlands have long been associated with ritual deposits in ancient Europe. People often placed valued objects into lakes, bogs, and rivers as offerings or ceremonial acts.If this was a ritual burial, it adds a deeper layer to the story. It suggests the dog was not only important in life, but still held meaning after death.Discoveries like this rarely give up their secrets immediately. Researchers will likely study the remains through dating and lab analysis to understand details such as the dog’s life, diet, health, and age at death.Over time, the burial could help answer bigger questions about how Stone Age people in Scandinavia lived, what role dogs played in their societies, and how early humans expressed loyalty, care, and respect for animals that shared their world.","Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered a striking Stone Age discovery: the well-preserved remains of a dog buried around 5,000 years ago.

"Lost sacred Nile tributaries in Egypt discovered beneath Karnak after 4,000 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/lost-sacred-nile-tributaries-in-egypt-discovered-beneath-karnak-after-4000-years/articleshow/127628660.cms,"

Scientists discover Karnak was built on a hidden Nile river island

Early settlement depended on river change

The temple complex once sat like an island

Later builders adapted to shifting waters

A major Nile branch flowed east of Karnak

Landscape echoes ancient belief

A slower view of a familiar monument





Ancient Karnak rose from a landscape shaped as much by water as by stone. For more than a century, excavations have focused on temples, walls and inscriptions, while the ground beneath them drew less attention. A new geoarchaeological study now shifts that focus. By drilling dozens of sediment cores across Karnak and its surroundings, researchers have traced how the River Nile once moved through the area. Their findings suggest the vast temple complex was built on a natural river terrace, once surrounded by channels. This setting may have echoed Egyptian ideas of a sacred mound rising from primordial waters. The work also helps narrow down when permanent building at Karnak became possible, offering a calmer but clearer view of how landscape and belief developed together.The study ”Conceptual origins and geomorphic evolution of the temple of Amun-Ra at Karnak (Luxor, Egypt)” shows that Karnak was not placed randomly on the floodplain. Beneath the temples lies a body of sandy deposits left by fast-flowing water thousands of years ago. These sands form a raised terrace, higher than the surrounding land. At the time of its formation, the area would have been unsuitable for long-term settlement. Only later did the Nile cut channels on either side, leaving a stable platform that people could occupy.Dating of the sediments suggests this terrace became dry and stable around 2520 BC, give or take several centuries. Before that, seasonal flooding would have made construction difficult. This timing aligns with the oldest pottery found on site, which points to early occupation during the late Old Kingdom or First Intermediate Period. The evidence supports the idea that Karnak only became viable once the river landscape shifted.Cores taken across the site reveal traces of former river channels both east and west of Karnak. These channels appear to have enclosed the terrace, turning it into an island of higher ground. Smaller channels even crossed parts of the site. Over time, some filled naturally with silt, while others remained active for centuries. The image that emerges is not a fixed setting but a patchwork of land and water that slowly changed.As dynasties rose and fell, the Nile continued to move. During the Middle Kingdom, some channels began to silt up, linking once separate areas of land. By the New Kingdom, parts of the river system were deliberately filled with sand, likely to support major construction projects. These actions suggest people were not only reacting to nature but shaping it to suit religious and political needs.One of the clearest findings is evidence for a substantial Nile channel east of the temple complex. Pottery and sediments show it was active from at least the First Intermediate Period through the New Kingdom. At its widest, it may have stretched several hundred meters. This channel later shifted eastward and eventually silted up, turning into a floodplain by the late classical period.The idea of Karnak rising from surrounding waters has long been noted in texts and temple symbolism. Egyptian creation myths describe a primaeval mound emerging from chaos. While the researchers avoid strong claims, the physical setting of an island terrace surrounded by channels fits this imagery in a quiet way. It suggests that natural features may have reinforced religious meaning, even if they were not the original reason for the site’s selection.The study does not rewrite Karnak’s history in dramatic terms. Instead, it adds depth. By combining sediment cores, pottery analysis and dating techniques, it fills gaps left by earlier work. The result is a calmer picture of a landscape in motion, where temples grew alongside changing rivers. Karnak appears less as a fixed monument and more as part of a living floodplain, shaped by time, water and gradual human choice.",Scientists discover Karnak was built on a hidden Nile river island.

Blood Falls in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry valleys : The iron-rich crimson waterfall mystery



Antarctica’s blood falls: Ancient subglacial lake supports unique microbial life



Blood falls and life in harsh conditions







Antarctica is also known to have some of the most extreme and harsh environments on the planet, where life struggles to exist in the freezing climate and harsh winds. However, even in such extreme conditions, there exists a fascinating natural wonder that is nothing short of surprising: Blood Falls, a waterfall that flows with a deep, reddish-colored liquid from the Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney. The sight of the waterfall is both fascinating and chilling, as if blood is oozing out of the ice. However, the actual story of its color, origin, and the life it supports beneath the glacier is much more interesting.Blood Falls is more than a strange sight; it is a symbol of the ability of life to thrive in extreme conditions and the natural processes that are taking place beneath the glaciers. The iron-rich, high-salinity water, which has been locked away for millions of years, is still supporting life and carving out the landscape, making it one of the most fascinating natural wonders in the world. Although it may look ominous due to its red color, it holds an amazing story of survival and geological history.Blood Falls is situated in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys, which are also known as one of the driest deserts in the world. The waterfall flows from the end of the Taylor Glacier. It cascades slowly into Lake Bonney and is approximately five stories high. The mere presence of the waterfall in such a dry and icy region is quite remarkable.Unlike the rivers in other regions, which are full of life and flow with a considerable amount of water, Blood Falls is seasonal, very slow-moving, and originates from water that is trapped deep beneath the ice.However, despite its terrifying look, the waterfall is not composed of blood. The red coloration is generated by iron-rich brine flowing out of the subglacial water that is trapped under the Taylor Glacier. About two million years ago, the rise of sea levels resulted in the formation of a saltwater lake in East Antarctica. Subsequent glaciation led to the formation of glaciers over the lake, which in turn sealed the lake from the atmosphere. The water beneath the glacier was highly salty, three times saltier than regular seawater, and did not freeze despite being covered by 400 meters of ice. When this iron-rich water flows out and interacts with the oxygen in the atmosphere, it oxidizes, resulting in the distinctive red coloration on the ice.Blood Falls is supported by a subglacial lake, which is completely isolated from sunlight and atmosphere. For millions of years, this lake has been isolated from the outside world, supporting a highly unique form of life. The lake is chock-full of iron and other minerals that are removed from the bedrock by glaciers. This ancient lake supports life in the form of microorganisms that have adapted to survive in extreme conditions such as the absence of oxygen and light. The microorganisms derive energy from sulphates, which are recycled back with the help of iron, thus supporting a chemical cycle. Blood Falls is one of the few instances of life that supports itself in extreme isolation.The waterfall is sustained by a system of subglacial rivers that transport highly saline water. Water with high salt content has a lower freezing point, and as such, the iron-rich brine is able to flow despite the cold conditions in Antarctica. As the iron-rich brine moves through the cracks in the glacier, it melts the surrounding ice slightly because of the latent heat, which sustains the flow of the waterfall. The iron content of the water increases as it approaches the surface, making the waterfall intensely red as it flows into Lake Bonney.In addition to its dramatic colour, Blood Falls gives scientists a window into life in such extreme environments. The microorganisms that exist beneath the glacier are similar to those found around deep-sea hydrothermal vents and are able to thrive in environments that are lacking oxygen and have high salinity levels. Researching these microorganisms can give scientists valuable information about life on Earth in the distant past and potentially help them understand how life might exist on other planets with similar extreme conditions, such as icy moons or arid worlds.","Blood Falls is situated in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys, which are also known as one of the driest deserts in the world. The red coloration is generated by iron-rich brine flowing out of the subglacial water that is trapped under the Taylor Glacier. The iron content of the water increases as it approaches the surface, making the waterfall intensely red.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127618756,imgsize-200662,width-400,resizemode-4/bleeding-waterfalls-of-antarctica-inside-the-mysterious-crimson-falls-that-hide-millions-of-years-of-frozen-secrets.jpg"

Derinkuyu underground city rediscovered after centuries of silence



How Cappadocia’s geology allowed an underground civilisation



Survival and daily life inside the underground city



How air shafts and wells sustained life in Derinkuyu



Derinkuyu’s legacy beneath Cappadocia today







Above ground, Cappadocia feels utterly otherworldly. Wind-carved fairy chimneys rise dramatically from dusty valleys, their pale pink and honey-coloured rock glowing brilliantly under the warm Turkish sun. Hot-air balloons drift gracefully overhead at dawn, and adventurous hikers trace winding paths through deep canyons shaped by ancient volcanic eruptions. Yet beneath this striking and dramatic landscape lies something even more astonishing. More than 85 metres below the surface, an entire underground city once secretly sheltered thousands of people, hidden from view and largely forgotten for many centuries.This vast subterranean settlement, now famously known as Derinkuyu, remained in near-constant use for countless generations. It was not a temporary refuge or a single isolated cave system, but a fully functioning, remarkably intricate city carved meticulously deep into the earth, capable of sustaining human life for months at a time under extraordinary conditions.Derinkuyu is the largest excavated underground city in the world.Stretching across 18 levels, it descends deeper than a modern skyscraper is tall. Tunnels, chambers and rooms extend for miles beneath Cappadocia, forming a complex network that once housed as many as 20,000 people.Originally known as Elengubu, the city passed through the hands of multiple civilisations. The Phrygians, Persians and later Byzantine Christians all expanded and adapted it over centuries as reported by BBC. Its final chapter came in the early 20th century, when Cappadocian Greeks fled the region during the Greco-Turkish War, abandoning the underground city almost overnight.What makes Derinkuyu even more remarkable is the suggestion that it was not alone. Archaeologists believe it may be linked to more than 200 smaller underground cities across the region, forming a hidden network beneath the Anatolian plains.For centuries, Derinkuyu slipped from collective memory. Its rediscovery in 1963 was not the result of a planned excavation, but a domestic mystery. A local resident, frustrated by chickens repeatedly vanishing into a crack in his home, decided to investigate. While renovating, he uncovered a dark passageway behind a wall.That opening led to one of more than 600 entrances now known to exist, many hidden inside private homes. Excavations soon revealed an underground world complete with living quarters, food stores, stables, chapels, schools and wineries. In 1985, Cappadocia and its subterranean cities were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Cappadocia’s geology made this extraordinary feat possible. The region’s soft volcanic rock, known as tuff, is easy to carve yet strong enough to remain stable. Combined with dry soil and minimal groundwater, it created ideal conditions for deep excavation using simple tools.Over millennia, the same volcanic material formed the fairy chimneys above ground. Below the surface, it allowed ancient builders to sculpt vast underground chambers with remarkable precision, long before modern engineering existed. The origins of Derinkuyu remain partly uncertain. Some historians credit the Hittites, who may have carved the earliest levels around 1200 BCE while seeking refuge from invading forces. Artefacts found within the city support this theory.However, much of the expansion is attributed to the Phrygians, an Iron Age civilisation known for their rock-cut architecture. As empires rose and fell across Anatolia, each group adapted the city to meet new needs, turning it into a layered record of human survival.Although Derinkuyu was likely used for storage in peaceful times, its primary purpose was protection. Cappadocia sat at the crossroads of empires, making it vulnerable to repeated invasions. Underground living offered safety when surface settlements were at risk.During the Byzantine era, particularly amid 7th-century raids, Derinkuyu reached its peak. Narrow corridors forced intruders to move single file, while massive circular stone doors could be rolled shut from the inside. Small holes in these doors allowed defenders to strike attackers while remaining protected. Living underground was far from comfortable. Residents relied on torchlight, stored waste in sealed clay jars and designated specific areas for the dead. Yet the city was carefully organised. Livestock were kept near the surface to manage odours and gases, while deeper levels housed homes, schools and communal spaces.Evidence of winemaking, including vats and amphorae, suggests that inhabitants prepared for long stays below ground. A Byzantine missionary school, identified by its distinctive vaulted ceilings, still stands within the maze of tunnels.Perhaps the most impressive feature of Derinkuyu is its ventilation system. More than 50 shafts circulated fresh air throughout the city, ensuring survival even when entrances were sealed. A deep well supplied clean water and could be cut off from the surface to prevent contamination.These systems suggest that air and water were central to the city’s original design. Without them, life underground on such a scale would have been impossible. Derinkuyu is the largest, but it is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. Over 200 underground cities have been discovered across Cappadocia, many connected by tunnels stretching up to 9 kilometres. Some descend three or more levels deep, each equipped with escape routes for emergencies.In 2014, archaeologists uncovered another massive underground settlement beneath Nevşehir, hinting that Cappadocia’s hidden world may still be far from fully revealed.Derinkuyu’s story ended in 1923 when its final inhabitants left. For decades, it lay silent beneath the fairy chimneys, known only to the earth above it. Today, visitors can descend into its narrow passages and experience the unsettling reality of life underground.What was once a place of fear and survival now stands as a testament to human ingenuity. Beneath Cappadocia’s beautiful surface lies a reminder that some of history’s greatest achievements were built not towards the sky, but deep into the ground.","Derinkuyu is the largest excavated underground city in the world.

Careful sampling from valuable artefacts

Chemical signatures point to a cosmic source

Implications for Iberian Bronze Age chronology

A rare confirmation for the Iberian Peninsula





For decades, the Villena Treasure has been examined and valued, most notably its gold. The trove, discovered in Alicante in 1963, contains dozens of well crafted items that are consistent with researchers' expectations for the Late Bronze Age. However, two little pieces never quite fit. They were dull, rusted, and constructed of iron in an era when iron was not supposed to exist in Iberia. For years, they were regarded as curiosities or potential incursions from a later time. New scientific examination has definitely placed them in the Bronze Age and suggested that their metal did not come from the Earth at all. Instead, it seems to have fallen from the sky.Among the gold bowls, bracelets and vessels were a plain open bracelet and a small hollow hemisphere covered with pierced gold sheet. Both looked out of place from the start. Their dark surface and heavy corrosion stood in sharp contrast to the surrounding goldwork. Early descriptions noted their iron-like appearance but stopped short of firm identification. Because large-scale iron production in Iberia began much later, these pieces caused discomfort. Some scholars suggested they must belong to a later phase, despite being found within a closed Bronze Age deposit.Before humans learnt how to smelt iron from ores, the only workable iron available was meteoritic. Iron meteorites are rich in nickel and cobalt, elements that are usually absent or present only in trace amounts in early terrestrial iron. Across the ancient world, a small number of prestige objects made from meteoritic iron are known, including beads from Egypt and the famous dagger from Tutankhamun’s tomb. These objects were rare, difficult to work with, and often symbolically charged.Identifying meteoritic iron is not straightforward, especially in objects that have been buried for thousands of years. Iron corrodes readily, and over long periods the corrosion process can strip away nickel and other elements that would normally signal an extraterrestrial origin. In extreme cases, little or no metal survives beneath the rust. This makes traditional metallographic analysis risky or impossible, particularly for museum objects that cannot be cut or transported easily.In 2007, researchers were granted permission to take tiny samples from the corroded surfaces of the Villena objects. The amounts removed were minute, taken from areas already damaged by oxidation. Later, a second slightly deeper sample was taken from the bracelet to improve confidence in the results. These samples consisted entirely of corrosion products rather than fresh metal, reflecting the fragile state of the objects.Despite these limitations, chemical analysis revealed patterns consistent with meteoritic iron. The ratios of nickel to iron and nickel to cobalt aligned closely with values seen in heavily weathered meteorites rather than terrestrial iron. While absolute nickel levels were low, this was expected given the age and degree of corrosion. When compared against published datasets, the Villena samples fell within the range associated with altered meteoritic material.If the Villena iron pieces are meteoritic, their presence no longer forces a later date for the treasure. Instead, they support a Late Bronze Age chronology before widespread iron production began in the region. This fits well with other evidence linking the Villena hoard to nearby sites such as Cabezo Redondo, which was abandoned before 1200 BC. The objects may have been valued not for practical use but for their rarity and origin.These findings make the Villena objects the first confirmed meteoritic iron artefacts from the Iberian Peninsula. While similar items are known elsewhere in Europe, they are uncommon and often slightly later in date. Further non-invasive testing could strengthen the case, but even now, the evidence suggests that Bronze Age communities in Iberia had access to and recognised the value of iron from space. The two modest objects, once overlooked, now sit quietly at the centre of a much larger story.","Researchers identify meteoritic iron in a 3,000-year-old Iberian treasure.

Sea conditions are forecast to be moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea, potentially disrupting small boats and beach activities.

What to expect next





While the UAE is known for its golden sun, residents woke up to a very different scene this Monday morning. A powerful low-pressure system has officially moved in, bringing with it a rare and dramatic display of nature: hail.As dawn broke, social media was flooded with videos from Al Rams and northern areas of Ras Al Khaimah, showing streets covered in small hailstones. This icy start wasn't just limited to the north; overnight rainfall has been soaking parts of Fujairah and Al Ain, turning the desert landscape into a cool, misty escape. For many, it’s a much-needed relief, but for those on the morning commute, it’s a signal to slow down and stay alert.According to the National Center of Meteorology (NCM), the current weather ""unsettledness"" is caused by an extension of a surface low-pressure system from the Red Sea, paired with an upper-air low. In simpler terms: cold air from the north is meeting moisture, creating perfect conditions for rain and hail.The temperature drop is noticeable across the board:As the unsettled weather continues, authorities are urging motorists and residents to take precautions:These advisories come amid a broader trend of weather system impacts on travel, daily life and coastal activities, with authorities emphasising caution near flood-prone or exposed areas.If you’re wondering whether to keep your umbrella handy, the answer is yes, but only for a little longer. The NCM predicts that while the rain may persist in northern and eastern regions throughout the day, the system will gradually weaken.However, a new challenge awaits early-morning commuters: fog. As the humidity rises and the winds calm down, thick mist is expected to blanket internal and coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Visibility could drop significantly, so if you have an early flight or a long drive, plan for extra time.","Temperatures are hovering between a crisp 12°C and 18°C, with recent lows previously hitting near-freezing points.

A travel reset worth the road trip from UAE to Khasab







If you are in the UAE and craving a break from the city buzz but don't want to hop on a long flight, there is a serene, breathtaking corner of the Arabian Peninsula that is quietly becoming one of the Middle East ’s most rewarding nature getaways: Khasab in Oman. Often called the “Norway of Arabia”, this fjord-lined coastal town on the Musandam Peninsula delivers dramatic scenery, calm turquoise waters, playful marine life and a slower pace that feels like another world entirely, all just a short road trip away.Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE. It is roughly a 2.5-hour drive from Dubai but once you cross the border, the striking landscape of steep mountains, fjord-like inlets and clear sea instantly wipes away any sense of city stress. The drive itself sets the tone, winding along coastal cliffs that plunge into deep, brilliant blue waters. There is little traffic and plenty of photo stops and by the time you reach Khasab, the transition from urban rush to nature’s calm is complete.What really sets Khasab apart is its dramatic fjords. These towering rock formations rising directly from glassy sea create a landscape that feels more like Scandinavia than the Arabian Peninsula. Taking a traditional Omani dhow cruise through these waterways is one of the quintessential ways to experience the region, with gentle breezes, calm seas and panoramic viewpoints in every direction.On these dhow boats you will often spot dolphins swimming alongside, a crowd-delighting feature of many cruises, especially in calmer morning waters.Local tour companies emphasise the high chances of dolphin sightings and immersive experiences that include swimming and snorkelling in sheltered coves.One of Khasab’s most magical moments is how effortlessly dolphins appear, gliding alongside boats as if they have always belonged there. Traditional dhow cruises also drift past isolated fishing villages accessible only by water, where life unfolds slowly and simply, far removed from the gloss and rush of city living.The turquoise waters around Musandam are not just beautiful; they are invitingly calm, making snorkelling and even beginner-friendly aquatic adventures very accessible. The sheltered fjords, like Khor Shem, offer crystal-clear conditions to float above vibrant coral and fish life, while kayaks let you explore hidden coves at your own pace.Meanwhile, traditional fishing villages dot the coastline, where life moves at its own rhythm. Some are accessible only by boat, offering a rare glimpse into coastal Omani culture untouched by the tourist trappings seen elsewhere.For travellers who want to linger, overnight dhow cruises offer an even richer perspective. These trips combine dolphin watching, kayaking, fishing and guided hikes and often include multi-course meals and gentle evenings anchored under starry skies. The experience lets visitors feel fully immersed in Musandam’s natural majesty — not just passing through it.With border crossings streamlined and travel buzz returning in early 2026, Khasab has emerged as a practical, scenic escape for UAE motorists and weekend adventurers. It is the kind of landscape that is easy to contactless book through tour operators that run day cruises and overnight stays, yet still rewarding for independent travellers who drive themselves across the border.Importantly, safety and tourism infrastructure, from boats to guides, means that even first-time visitors can enjoy this rugged beauty without stress. However, it is not just the dramatic fjords and dolphins. The peaceful natural environment and slower pace of life are big draws for anyone feeling the strain of urban living.Here’s how travellers are enhancing their Khasab trips -Khasab is not just another scenic destination, it is becoming a symbol of accessible adventure for Gulf residents. Just a few hours from the UAE’s glitzy cities, this calm and dramatic corner of Oman delivers fjord landscapes, wildlife encounters and a sense of peace that’s rare and memorable. Whether you are planning a weekend reset, a family outing or a deeper tropical exploration, Khasab brings nature and a touch of magic right to your doorstep.For UAE residents without a visa hassle, remember that Oman often allows UAE residents a visa-free entry if your residency card is valid, making spontaneous Khasab road trips even easier.","Khasab sits on the Musandam Peninsula, an Omani exclave separated from the rest of Oman by the UAE.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

What is Ejari in Dubai? Why expats can face rental trouble and legal visa issues without it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-ejari-in-dubai-why-expats-can-face-rental-trouble-and-legal-visa-issues-without-it/articleshow/127372648.cms,"New expats in Dubai face major hurdles if their rent isn’t Ejari-registered / AI Image

What is Ejari in Dubai?

What can go wrong without Ejari?

You cannot activate electricity or water through DEWA without an Ejari number.

Immigration authorities require it for your residency visa and for sponsoring family members.

and for sponsoring family members. Telecom providers like Etisalat and Du use it to verify your home address.

If your landlord tries to raise the rent illegally or evict you without notice, the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre (RDSC) will only hear your case if you have a registered Ejari.

Common mistakes among expats

If the landlord doesn’t register Ejari promptly, tenants can be stuck without utilities.

In shared homes or co-living setups, all occupants must be declared on Ejari; failure to do so can cause service issues or legal complications.

Some rentals are wrongly uploaded as “rented” in the system, blocking new Ejari registrations until previous records are cleared.





For thousands of expats arriving in Dubai this month, the hunt for the perfect home is the first major hurdle. However, a wave of sophisticated rental scams emerged in early 2026, targeting newcomers who are eager to secure housing quickly. Fraudsters are increasingly posing as legitimate agents or owners, offering luxury apartments at below-market rates to lure in unsuspecting tenants.These ""phantom landlords"" often present official-looking contracts but intentionally skip the most crucial step: Ejari registration. Without this government-verified document, a tenant has no legal standing, making them vulnerable to ""double-leasing"" (where the same unit is rented to multiple people) or vanishing ""agents"" who pocket the deposit and disappear.Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), designed to digitally record every tenancy contract. Until that registration is complete, a lease is effectively invisible to authorities and vendors.Ejari transforms a private agreement into a legally binding document recognized by the state. Beyond just proving you live there, this certificate is the ""master key"" required to unlock almost every essential service in the city.Without a valid Ejari, new expats find themselves stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, unable to complete basic tasks that are vital for settling into their new lives.George (not his real name) arrived in Dubai, found an apartment, signed a lease, paid his deposit, but skipped Ejari registration. Almost immediately, he ran into problems: DEWA (electricity/water authority) blocked his applications. Telecom companies wouldn’t connect broadband. Visa-related processes stalled. Verification of his address couldn’t proceed. Without the Ejari certificate, nothing worked.This isn’t rare, dozens of renters share similar experiences online where utilities, government services and official procedures are halted without Ejari. Registration isn’t just bureaucratic formality; it’s a legal gateway for life in Dubai.Key issues when Ejari is missing:One major confusion stems from the belief that a signed tenancy contract alone is enough. In fact, it’s not, only once a contract is uploaded and approved in Ejari is it formally recognised by authorities, courts, and service providers.Another frequent issue is who handles registration. By law, landlords are responsible, but in practice many tenants end up doing it themselves or paying agents or typing centres to process the paperwork. Without clarity on who manages Ejari, delays often occur.Here’s why that matters:The impact of following these regulations is peace of mind. By insisting on an Ejari-registered contract, expats ensure they are part of a regulated, transparent ecosystem. It prevents the heartbreak of ""rental ghosting"" and ensures that the thousands of dirhams spent on deposits and rent are protected by UAE law.As Dubai continues to grow, these digital safeguards are designed to make the city one of the most secure rental markets in the world, provided that tenants take that final, 30-minute step to make their contract official.","Ejari (Arabic for my rent) is the official online registration system managed by the Dubai Land Department and Real Estate Regulatory Agency.

Road safety alerts

Stay Updated: Monitor the NCM’s ""Red"" and ""Yellow"" alerts before heading out on long drives.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter. For many, the arrival of clouds and light drizzle is a celebrated event, signaling the peak of ""Karak tea season"" and outdoor gatherings.While the seas remain generally calm to moderate in the Arabian Gulf, the refreshing winds, reaching up to 35 km/h, add a crisp feel to the air.Whether the rain hits your neighborhood or just teases from the clouds, it’s a time to wrap up warm and enjoy the rarest of desert sights: a rainy day in the Emirates.","The UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled. Beyond just the money, the law empowers courts to mandate ""digital rehabilitation"" courses for parents, ensuring they gain the technical skills needed to protect their families moving forward.Staying on the right side of the law begins with activating parental controls across all home devices and ensuring that your children only access age-appropriate platforms, strictly avoiding the ""under-13"" social media trap. Make it a habit to perform a weekly digital check-in to monitor for signs of cyberbullying or contact from strangers, and always utilize the Safe Use filters provided by your UAE internet service provider.Most importantly, foster an environment of open communication where your children feel safe reporting suspicious activity, ensuring that your home remains a sanctuary of ""Mindful Digital Citizenship"" rather than a source of legal liability.","The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences.

Reality behind the snow





Imagine waking up, looking out your window in Dubai, and seeing the Burj Khalifa draped in a blanket of fresh, powdery snow. That was the dream His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (lovingly known as Fazza), shared with his millions of followers this Thursday.His Highness, who is basically Dubai’s unofficial ""Chief Storyteller,"" posted a viral image that looked like a scene straight out of a Disney movie, except the ""Castle"" was a world-famous skyscraper.While the photo was a creative ""what if,"" it perfectly captured the mood of a city currently obsessed with the cold.

How the Darb toll system really works in the UAE



You must register your vehicle with the Darb toll management system to receive legitimate alerts about unpaid tolls or fines.

Registered vehicles are monitored automatically; toll charges are debited from your account or wallet within the official app or platform.

Official Darb alerts always appear via the app or authorised government SMS services, not from foreign or unrecognised numbers.

Tips to protect yourself from toll scams



Ignore Unknown Toll Alerts - If the toll message comes from an unfamiliar number or contains an unusual link, do not click it, even if the amount looks small. Check Your Payments Directly - Open the Darb app or visit the official website to see if there are legitimate pending charges or fines. Don’t Reply to Suspicious Messages - Responding to scam texts, even with “Y” as instructed, can trigger further scam activity or lead to phishing. Report Scam Messages - Forward the suspicious message to your carrier or mark it as spam; consider notifying local authorities or Q Mobility support. Learn Scam Signs - Scammers often use international numbers, grammar errors, URLs that resemble official domains but differ slightly, and urgent language warning of fines.

Fake Messages Sent by Darb Toll Scammers





Motorists across the UAE, especially in Abu Dhabi, have been warned about fraudulent messages lurking in text inboxes that claim to be official Darb toll alerts. These scam notifications say that drivers have pending Darb toll fees and urge them to click on a link or reply “Y” to settle fines quickly. However, authorities say that these are fake messages designed to trick people into clicking malicious links and potentially giving up personal or payment information.Prompted by a spike in user reports and online complaints, transport officials and cybersecurity experts are now sounding the alarm for drivers to remain vigilant and only use authorised government channels to check toll violations or make payments.In recent days, several UAE residents reported receiving SMS messages titled “DARB-Alert” claiming there are pending toll fees, often just a few dirhams and warning that a fine (typically Dh100) and points could be imposed if the fee isn’t paid “today.”The messages often include:However, when investigators looked at these messages, they found red flags:Similar patterns are being discussed across social media threads, with users warning each other not to click the links.One Dubai Reddit user noted the suspicious URL included spelling errors and a non-government “.com” address, something official toll notifications would never use.Q Mobility, the operator of Abu Dhabi’s Darb toll system and part of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) has repeatedly warned users to verify any message claiming to be from them. According to a recent social media post from the company, the only trusted channels for toll alerts and payments are:Q Mobility stressed that official notifications clearly identify themselves and never request responses like “Reply Y.” They also do not include unofficial URLs.Cyber scams of this kind are part of a broader trend of phishing and fake alert campaigns targeting UAE residents in recent years. Authorities including Abu Dhabi Police have actively run awareness campaigns like the “Be Cautious” initiative to educate the public about online fraud tactics, from deceptive links to phishing phone calls.These scam messages exploit urgency and fear, suggesting fines or legal penalties, to trick people into acting impulsively. That’s a common tactic in digital fraud, and law enforcement agencies caution against clicking unfamiliar links or providing sensitive personal or financial data.Similar warnings have been issued about traffic fine phishing emails in the UAE, where fraudsters use fake police logos and official-looking layouts to dupe people into clicking links to bogus payment pages.Understanding how the toll system functions sheds light on why you should not trust random messages:If you suspect you genuinely owe a toll payment, you should open the Darb app or log in to darb.qmobility.ae directly, not via a link in a text message.Here’s how residents are being advised to stay safe:With digital payments and e-services becoming the norm for tolls, parking and traffic fines, scams that mimic these systems can cause real harm, from financial loss to identity theft. Authorities across the UAE have consistently advised residents to verify all digital communications before acting.Abu Dhabi’s integrated transport technology continues to evolve, including paid parking integration through the Darb app and new traffic regulations to improve road flow and compliance. But the convenience of these services also attracts fraudsters looking to exploit public trust.Staying informed and cautious is essential to avoiding scams and ensuring that digital traffic services work as intended.",UAE drivers warned about fraudulent messages claiming to be official Darb toll alerts.

Why hundreds of bald eagles are flocking to northern British Columbia’s frozen mountains during winter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-hundreds-of-bald-eagles-are-flocking-to-northern-british-columbias-frozen-mountains-during-winter/articleshow/126672217.cms,"Source: X

Why British Columbia’s winter landscapes draw bald eagles together



Bald eagles and rare winter group behaviour



What winter eagle gatherings reveal to scientists







In the frozen mountains of northern British Columbia, there was the unusual occurrence of a rare incident in the wildlife scene where the bald eagles were gathered in their hundreds in one spot, and in the middle of winter. Against the background of mountains laden with snow and the icy river valley, the sight was quite outstanding and unusual. For bald eagles, which stand out in their status as symbols of freedom, power, and dominance in nature, it was highly unusual for them to congregate in such huge numbers because they were predominantly lone animals and territorial in their behaviour patterns. The severity of the weather seemed to have had a huge effect on the eagles, as only limited spaces were available and where their feeds were still accessible, forcing unprecedented gatherings that stunned researchers and local communities alike. Such rare congregations offer scientists valuable insight into how climate stress reshapes wildlife behaviour and survival strategies.The northern area of British Columbia is important to the wintering survival of bald eagles. Though much of this area will freeze, there will always be fast-moving rivers that are partially open, providing the eagles with readily available fish. Rivers that support salmon are usually connected, forming pathways to life-sustaining riverways.As winter approaches and the temperature cools, bald eagles from an increasingly vast area will migrate to these feeding grounds, and many will be seen in one small area.The harsh environment imposed by winter causes a shift in bald eagles' normal habits. The immobility brought by snow, the uninhabitability of lakes due to ice, and the shorter daylight hours make energy conservation essential. The habit of securing territories disappears, with eagles seeking locations close to food sources. The movement of prey through the snow-covered environment is predictable, helping the eagles modify their hunting patterns. What seems like a rare concentration of birds is, in actual fact, a decision based on survival that is influenced by the environment.In areas outside breeding colonies or feeding grounds, however, bald eagles tend to be alone. Adults do not compete with each other, particularly around feeding areas. To witness so many of them assemble at one place is a clear indication that their social norms have been temporarily overlooked. Experts say that it is possible only in areas where food is plentiful and accessible. In such areas, even though competition may be a disadvantage, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to observe their flexibility in handling their socialisation.The group behaviours exhibited during winter are very advantageous in several ways. The eagles can view each other in search of food, thus saving time looking for it in the frozen land. Additionally, the dominant eagles will either jump over the ice or find a source of food first as an indirect means of providing for the rest of the group members. The younger and weaker eagles are able to get protection by staying in a group, thus minimising the chances of starvation.Large winter gatherings offer a unique opportunity to study bald eagles under environmental stress. Scientists are able to estimate population size, age structure, feeding patterns, and social tolerance. It helps them to get an idea about the resiliency of the species towards extreme weather and habitat pressure. This kind of data is very crucial in view of changing climatic cycles that disturb food availability and migration behaviour in an ecosystem.The sight of hundreds of eagles in one place often plays the role of a sign of ecological vigour: healthy fish populations, undisrupted waterways, and preserved forest habitats.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

WhatsApp sued, Meta alleged to have access to all user chats







Hours after Whatsapp chief Will Cathcart called out Elon Musk for posting ‘totally false’ information that “WhatsApp is not secure,” the Meta-owned instant messaging app has launched Strict Account Settings – a lockdown-style feature, aimed at protecting users protect “from the most sophisticated of cyber threats. ”“At WhatsApp, we think you should be able to have a private conversation online, just like you would in-person. We will always defend that right to privacy for everyone, starting with default end-to-end encryption. But we also know that a few of our users – like journalists or public-facing figures – may need extreme safeguards against rare and highly-sophisticated cyber attacks,” the company said in a post.As per WhatsApp, if users turn this feature on, certain account settings will lock to the most restrictive settings, limiting how WhatsApp works in some ways. For example, it will block all attachments and media from people not in your contacts.“Strict Account Settings is one of many ways we’re working to protect you from the most sophisticated of cyber threats. We’ve also rolled out a programming language called Rust behind the scenes to help keep your photos, videos, and messages safe from things like spyware, so you can share and chat with confidence,” WhatsApp added.WhatsApp says that Strict Account Settings feature is being rolled out gradually over the coming weeks. Once updated, users can enable the feature by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced.The feature comes a day after an international group of plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit against WhatsApp, accusing the company of defrauding billions of users by allegedly maintaining 'backdoor access to private communications that the company claims are ""end-to-end encryption"" (E2EE). The lawsuit claims that WhatsApp can “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users' purportedly 'private' communications”.Meta called the lawsuit 'frivolous' and 'absurd', and company spokesperson Andy Stone said that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs' counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false. WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction,” Stone told Bloomberg.Cathcart also lashed out at Musk by saying that the lawsuit was filed by lawyers who previously defended spyware company NSO Group.“WhatsApp can't read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don't have access to them. This is a no-merit, headline-seeking lawsuit brought by the very same firm defending NSO after their spyware attacked journalists and government officials,"" Cathcart wrote on X.","Strict Account Settings is a lockdown-style feature, aimed at protecting users protect ‘from the most sophisticated of cyber threats’ The feature comes a day after an international group of plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit against WhatsApp. The lawsuit claims that WhatsApp can ‘store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users' purportedly 'private' communications’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127639492,imgsize-20814,width-400,resizemode-4/whatsapp-strict-account-settings.jpg"

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.
