What is TikTok's 'Gen Z boss and a mini' trend? Why is it facing backlash?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-tiktoks-gen-z-boss-and-a-mini-trend-why-is-it-facing-backlash/articleshow/111758680.cms,"A video posted by TBH Skincare on social media platforms has sparked a heated debate about the behaviour of Gen Z and the concept of ""cringe."" The clip features a group of young women dancing and chanting in their office, taking turns to describe their characteristics, inspired by the recent ""boots and a slicked back bun"" meme that originated on TikTok .Despite its intention as a lighthearted and enjoyable activity, the "" Gen Z boss and a mini "" meme faced significant criticism when it spread to corporate accounts. Online commentators labelled the video as ""cringe"". Whereas, the ""corporate"" used it to satirise the forced ""fun activities"" that often occur at work events.As the video gained popularity, some commentators suggested that it represented the decline of Gen Z, implying that they had succumbed to the same cringe-worthy behaviour they had previously mocked millennials for. Millennials have often been the target of Gen Z's ridicule, portrayed as overly sincere and obsessed with pop culture phenomena like Harry Potter, Taylor Swift, and The Office.Moreover, the negative reaction to the video took a misogynistic turn as it spread to the ""manosphere,"" an online space where toxic masculinity and the categorisation of men into ""alphas,"" ""betas,"" and ""sigmas"" are prevalent. The intense criticism led the women in the original video to post a follow-up, in which they danced and chanted to the tune of the negative comments they had received.The viral spread of the ""Gen Z boss and a mini"" video briefly shed light on the complex and often troubling dynamics of gender and generational divides on the internet.","The viral spread of the ""Gen Z boss and a mini"" video briefly shed light on the complex and often troubling dynamics of gender and generational divides on the internet.

NEW DELH: Thomas Crooks, who carried out a failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, was likely planning a more complex attack , potentially using an explosive device as a distraction, investigators have said.Crooks' cell phone and a remote transmitter were found next to his body after he was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper.It was also revealed that Crooks had asked his boss for a day off work on July 13 because he had ""something to do"".Law enforcement spotted Crooks hanging around the rally venue, the AGR International Inc. Complex, more than an hour before Trump took the stage. Officers noticed Crooks carrying a rangefinder, raising further suspicions.Despite these observations, no additional security measures were taken, and Crooks was able to access the rooftop of the building where he positioned himself with a stolen AR-style rifle. Crooks fired multiple shots one of which grazed Trump's ear, another tragically killed Corey Comperatore, who was shielding his family from the gunfire.The cell phone and remote transmitter found next to Crooks' body suggest he may have been planning a more complex attack, potentially using an explosive device as a distraction.Investigators believe the transmitter was linked to an explosive in Crooks' car.However, the Secret Service sniper was able to stop Crooks before he could carry out the full extent of his plan.Law enforcement sources revealed that there were two sniper teams positioned near the building, but no local police officers were stationed on the rooftop where Crooks was located, contradicting earlier statements from the Secret Service director.This security lapse allowed Crooks to access the rooftop and carry out the attack, albeit unsuccessfully.The FBI is now investigating the two cell phones linked to Crooks, one found on his body and another with a dead battery at his parents' residence. Authorities hope to uncover more details about Crooks' motives and potential accomplices through the digital forensic analysis of these devices.The discovery of Crooks' cell phone and transmitter next to his body has only added to the complexity of the investigation, as authorities work to piece together the full extent of his planned attack on the former president.",Thomas Crooks carried out a failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13.

Barron Trump Height: How tall is Barron Trump? What is his height?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-tall-is-barron-trump-what-is-his-height/articleshow/111610554.cms,"Former President Donald Trump, center right, stands with his wife Melania, second left, their son Barron, center left, and father-in-law Viktor Knavs, as the coffin carrying the remains of Amalija Knavs, the former first lady's mother, is carried into the Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea for her funeral, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Palm Beach, Fla.

How tall is he exactly?

Is he the tallest child of a US President?

Where is he going to college?

Barron Trump , the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently drawn attention due to his remarkable height. Photographed at his maternal grandmother’s funeral recently, the now-17-year-old's stature was striking, highlighting just how much he has grown. For those who haven't been following Barron closely, this recent appearance might come as a surprise, prompting comments like, “Man, that kid shot up like a weed!”The exact height of Barron Trump is a topic of some debate, even within his own family.Donald Trump has mentioned different figures, claiming at various times that Barron is either 6 feet, 7 inches or 6 feet, 8 inches tall. This variation might be due to differences in measurement methods, but it’s also notable given Donald Trump's history of exaggerating his own height. Whether he’s boasting, downplaying, or genuinely uncertain about Barron’s height, the fact remains that Barron is exceptionally tall.Given his impressive stature, Barron might hold a unique place in history as the tallest child of a U.S. president. Historically, presidential children’s heights were not meticulously recorded, making it difficult to confirm if Barron holds the record. For instance, while Abraham Lincoln was the tallest president at 6 feet, 4 inches, there is little information about the height of his son, Robert Lincoln. Similarly, no records detail the heights of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s sons or other presidential offspring. Peter Kastor, a professor specializing in presidential history at Washington University in St. Louis, notes that records of presidents' heights are sparse, let alone those of their children.Reports on Donald Trump’s reaction to Barron’s height are mixed. Trump's frequent mentions of Barron’s height suggest a sense of pride. For example, when discussing Barron’s recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, Trump affectionately referred to him as “My Barron. My tall Barron. He’s very tall. My beautiful Barron.” However, there are also anecdotes suggesting that Trump might feel some jealousy. Michael Wolff’s 2019 book mentions Trump being envious of Barron’s height when he was just 12 years old.Earlier reports suggested that Barron might attend the University of Pennsylvania, following in his father's footsteps at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce. He was also considering New York University. However, a recent TikTok post indicates that Barron is keeping his options open and might even take a gap year, given the significant developments in his family's life. Donald Trump recently praised his son, saying, ""He's tall, good-looking... a very good student. He's applied to colleges and gets into everywhere he goes. He's very sought after because he's a very smart guy, a very tall guy, and a great kid.""","Barron Trump, the youngest son of former President Donald Trump, has recently drawn attention due to his remarkable height.

Pinning important folders

Popular file management app Files by Google is hinting at new features in its latest beta version . These features cater to users who crave more organisational power: the ability to create compressed ZIP archives and pin frequently accessed folders for quicker access.Currently, Files by Google excels at unpacking ZIP files, but the ability to create them has been absent.The new beta suggests this functionality might be on the way. This would allow users to pack multiple files into a single ZIP archive and aims to streamline sharing large sets of data via email, cloud storage, or messaging apps. Also, ZIP compression can significantly reduce file size, freeing up valuable storage space on your device.The beta also hints at a ""Pin to collection"" feature. This would enable users to pin frequently accessed folders to the Collection tab on the app's home screen. Currently, this tab offers access to starred files and a Safe Folder.Pinning folders allows users to bypass unnecessary navigation and jump straight into the folders they use the most, saving time and effort.These features were discovered in the Files by Google beta version 1.4237.652465286.1-release, but are not yet accessible to all users. This suggests Google is still in the testing phase, gathering user feedback before a wider rollout.","New features include the ability to create compressed ZIP archives and pin frequently accessed folders for quicker access.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.
