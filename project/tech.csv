Theare reportedly setting their sights on three key targets to strengthen their frontcourt following the shocking trade of Anthony Davis to the Dallas Mavericks. According to ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel, the Lakers have expressed interest in Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, Walker Kessler of the Utah Jazz, and Nic Claxton of the Brooklyn Nets.With Davis now in Dallas, the Los Angeles Lakers find themselves without a true starting center. The urgency to add size and defensive presence has placed a significant emphasis on securing one of these three big men. However, acquiring any of them will come at a steep price, making it a challenge for Los Angeles to strike a deal.Among the three, Myles Turner has been the most talked-about option. The 28-year-old center has been a crucial part of Indiana’s recent success, and the Pacers have shown little willingness to move him. Given their strong performance in recent weeks, it is unlikely that the Los Angeles Lakers can meet Indiana’s demands in a trade.Walker Kessler, meanwhile, has been linked to Los Angeles multiple times this season. At just 23 years old, he has been a standout for the Jazz, who reportedly have a high asking price for him. This could pose a problem for the Lakers, as they may not have the necessary assets to convince Utah to part ways with their promising young center.Nic Claxton is another intriguing option, but the Brooklyn Nets ’ rebuilding situation complicates matters. At 25, he has been having a strong season, making him a valuable piece for Brooklyn. The Nets are expected to demand significant draft capital in any trade, something the Los Angeles Lakers currently lack.One of the biggest obstacles for Los Angeles is their limited trade assets. While all three centers would be strong additions to a lineup featuring LeBron James and Luka Doncic, making a deal work financially and strategically is proving to be difficult. The Los Angeles Lakers would likely need to part ways with players like Dalton Knecht or Austin Reaves to make a competitive offer. However, both have been considered untouchable in trade discussions, further complicating negotiations.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers eyeing $76.5 million Boston Celtics star after blockbuster trade for Luka Doncic The Lakers will have to choose between making a big trade or finding another way to deal with their frontcourt issues as the trade deadline draws near.

“May have some adversity”: Padres' Yu Darvish claims Dodgers' Roki Sasaki battling 'hard times' as MLB debut nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/may-have-some-adversity-padres-yu-darvish-claims-dodgers-roki-sasaki-battling-hard-times-as-mlb-debut-nears/articleshow/117891248.cms,"Image via Roki Sasaki/ Instagram

Yu Darvish's statement on Roki Sasaki's 'hard times' before MLB debut

“We’ll see [how] the season pans out for Roki. He may have some adversity that he needs to overcome, some hard times that he needs to overcome, and if he does reach out to me in those moments, obviously I will give him the support that I can give him. I think it's important to do that not only as a player, but as a human being.”

“The Dodgers routinely churn out quality young players. But they have trouble keeping pitchers healthy. That’s a concern. And it’s something Sasaki will have to answer. Considering how much money Sasaki left on the table by choosing to play in MLB as early as he did, it’s paramount that he stays healthy before getting a shot at free agency — which won’t come again for a handful of years.”

Roki Sasaki has been preparing for his MLB debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers . However, there might be certain difficulties that he had to overcome before the Spring Training. San Diego Padres star Yu Darvish recently highlighted Sasaki's struggles with ""hard times"" before talking about supporting the Dodgers star through them. Here's everything about Darvish's statement on Sasaki:MLB analyst Will Sammon previously revealed how the Dodgers have been stressed about Roki Sasaki's ""health"" as the Spring Training nears. However, Sasaki might be struggling with issues beyond health. According to the San Diego Padres pitcher Yu Darvish, Sasaki has been going through pretty ""hard times,"" and he is willing to support the Dodgers star through them.Yu Darvish's statement on Roki Sasaki came via his interpreter Shingo Horie, during Padres press conference earlier this week, in which the pitcher said:Talking about Will Sammon's comment, the MLB analyst highlighted in his recent report that the Dodgers have been concerned about his health. Talking about the Dodgers' history with keeping ""pitchers"" in good health, Sammon said:Roki Sasaki was announced as the young Japanese rookie draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, last month. Amidst the anticipation of his MLB debut, the former general manager of Rockies called Sasaki as a ""development project"" , and not completely ready for his debut game.","Roki Sasaki has been preparing for his MLB debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Blue Jays plans to attract Pete Alonso by beating the Mets' $70 Million offer

""Pete Alonso's market -- and some of the reporting around it -- has been ... unique. Yes, the Blue Jays like Alonso, but this continues to feel like a situation where Alonso is waiting for the Mets. Like they've done many times in past pursuits, the Blue Jays can position themselves well as the next-best option here.""

""It may be enough in the end, but my eyes are still on the Mets. Adding Alonso to this lineup on a three- or four-year deal would be quite an upgrade for the Blue Jays. If any team has the money to steal the slugger from the Mets, it's the Blue Jays,""

Amidst Pete Alonso 's contract discussions with the New York Mets , the Toronto Blue Jays have come out to be a potential team interested in signing the first baseman. In fact, according to a recent report, the Blue Jays are most likely to beat the Mets' previous offer to Alonso, with a $116 Million contract, in hopes of signing him for the upcoming season.The New York Mets have offered Pete Alonso a contract worth $70 Million for 3-years, which, according to multiple reports, the first baseman has already rejected. However, with just a few weeks left until Spring Training, the Toronto Blue Jays are highly likely to offer a contract that would lure Alonso into signing with them.According to Newsweek, Pete Alonso's current market value is somewhere around $174 Million for a 6-year deal. That's an average of around $29 Million a year. However, the Mets' previous offer was making this number $23.3 Million, which is pretty low. Therefore, according to the publication, the team might offer a 4-year deal worth $116 to beat the Mets' offer.The Blue Jays' contract is worth evaluating for Pete Alonso because it doesn't just offer him his annual market value but also won't be making him commit for a long 6 years. Therefore, Alonso's agent Scott Boras might want to leverage out a little more to get the first baseman signed for a better deal with the Blue Jays.Talking about Pete Alonso's future with the Toronto Blue Jays, the ex-Mets general manager recently expressed finding the two ""a great fit."" Nevertheless, MLB insider Keegan Matheson also talked about Alonso's future with the Blue Jays recently and said:Matheson concluded.The New York Yankees previously made an attractive offer to Pete Alonso. However, according to a recent report, it was Alonso's agent Scott Boras, who failed to retain the Yankee's interest in signing the first baseman.","The New York Mets have offered Pete Alonso a contract worth $70 Million for 3-years, which, according to multiple reports, the first baseman has already rejected.

NFL Veteran Antonio Brown ‘Praises’ Kanye West’s Wife Bianca For Shocking Grammy Look,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-veteran-antonio-brown-praises-kanye-wests-wife-bianca-for-shocking-grammy-look/articleshow/117893934.cms,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori made waves at the Grammy Awards red carpet.

What Did NFL Veteran Antonio Brown Have To Say About Bianca Censori's Bold Grammy Look?

This year’s Grammy Awards had quite a few memorable moments. From Taylor Swift’s champagne dance to Chappell Roan’s speech, there were plenty of highlights. However, Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori were probably the most talked about people from the show. The couple reportedly did not stay for the show but that’s not why fans were shocked. Bianca wore a bold, see-through and flimsy sheath sans any undergarment and fans were surprised by the barely-there number. However, NFL veteran Antonio Brown had a cheeky compliment for Bianca’s look.The former wide receiver who played 12 seasons in the NFL, primarily with the Pittsburgh Steelers wrote on X, “Love Bianca’s dress.” He shared the caption alongside a photo of an unnamed man who’s holding up something invisible. Brown was possibly making a joke on the barely-there dress which Bianca wore.Censori arrived at the award show wearing a long, black fur coat, which she removed as she walked down the carpet. Underneath the coat, she wore a skin-toned see-through sheath and paired it with a slicked-back bun and minimal makeup. Kanye, however, was fully clothed and wore his signature black ensemble with a diamond chain.Bianca and Kanye were reportedly not invited to the event and left the venue shortly after their red carpet appearance. That's not the only drama surrounding the couple. Shortly after, Kanye unfollowed everyone on Instagram except Taylor Swift the night before the Grammys. This is not the first time Bianca’s wardrobe has grabbed eyeballs. The architect and model has previously worn some erratic items of clothing, including body tape, a sheer raincoat, full-body stockings and even a faux stuffed cat.","Bianca Censori wore a see-through dress at the Grammy Awards.

Kendrick Lamar’s Grammy Wins Set the Stage for a Super Bowl Statement Performance



Kendrick Lamar Makes History as Super Bowl’s First Solo Rap Headliner: “They Got the Right One”



""Rap music is still the most impactful genre… They got the right one,""

SZA + Kendrick = Super Bowl Fireworks



The NFL, the Grammys, and the Perfect Storm of Hype



Kendrick Lamar just made history at the 2025 Grammys, garnering five major wins for his diss track Not Like Us: it includes Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rap Performance. Now, he's straight into Super Bowl LIX as the first-ever solo rapper to headline the halftime show.So what does this all mean for his performance? Well, it's about to get bigger, bolder, and more legendary than we ever imaginedWith 22 career Grammys under his belt, Kendrick Lamar is now officially one of the most decorated rappers out there ever. His latest sweep isn't merely about trophies: it's about momentum.Think about it: Not Like Us was already a cultural earthquake, and now it's Grammy-approved. That means fans will be begging to hear it at the Super Bowl. If he performs it, it won't just be a song—it'll be a statement.And let's not forget, Grammy wins come with huge streaming boosts—so expect millions of new listeners tuning in, right before he hits the Super Bowl stage.We’ve seen rap at the Super Bowl before—Kendrick was part of Dr. Dre’s epic 2022 halftime show—but this time? He’s headlining solo. That’s a game-changer.The NFL would go on to select Kendrick Lamar as the very first solo-rap headliner; it would not be any simple booking. And Kendrick agrees, too, adding,he said.Expect a setlist full of Grammy-winning anthems (Not Like Us, HUMBLE.), deep cuts, and maybe even a surprise guest. And given his Compton roots, don't be shocked if he brings in L.A.-themed visuals and high-energy theatrics.Joining Lamar on stage is another Grammy winner who's riding major momentum heading into the Super Bowl: SZA. Their chemistry, seen in hits like All the Stars and Lamar's latest album GNX, could make for one of the most electrifying collaborations in Super Bowl history.And if their Super Bowl teaser trailer—where SZA literally drenched Kendrick in Gatorade—is any sign, this performance is going to be high-energy, playful, and unforgettable.This time couldn't be better. The Grammys were on February 3. The Super Bowl is on February 9. That's less than a week for Lamar to ride his Grammy high straight into the world's biggest stage.And there's more-right after the Super Bowl, Lamar and SZA are embarking on a 19-city tour. Expect Super Bowl exposure to send ticket sales through the roof. If Rihanna's post-Super Bowl streams surged 640% last year, imagine what this will do for Kendrick.It is not just about a halftime show. It's a cultural moment. Grammy wins, Super Bowl headliner status, and the weight of hip-hop's global influence all come together in one massive performance.Kendrick Lamar isn't just performing—he's making history. And come February 9, the whole world will be watching.Also read - Will SZA Perform Her Grammy-Winning Songs at Super Bowl 2025?",Kendrick Lamar will be the first solo rapper to headline the Super Bowl halftime show.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic. In his memoir, Spare, the Duke of Sussex talks about reaching out to a medium with supernatural abilities to communicate with Diana, who passed away in a car accident in Paris in 1997, just before his 13th birthday, The Mirror reported.The Duke received a message from his mother through the psychic, who told him, ""You're living the life she wanted for you."" Harry, now 40, says that the medium also told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which made his neck warm and his eyes fill with tears.The psychic shared that Diana knew Harry was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion."" She added that Diana understood Harry had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in time.Another anecdote involved Prince Harry’s son, Archie. The psychic reportedly described how Diana’s spirit witnessed Archie accidentally breaking a Christmas tree ornament shaped like Queen Elizabeth. When asked, Harry admitted the incident had occurred, adding that Archie had attempted to fix the ornament.The medium suggested Diana found humour in the situation, delighting in the antics of her grandson she never had the chance to meet.In Spare, Prince Harry also recounts an extraordinary encounter with a leopard during a trip to Botswana with his brother, Prince William. He interpreted the animal’s presence as a comforting sign from his late mother, suggesting that ""everything will be fine."" However, the experience was not without fear, as he briefly worried the leopard might attack.Harry has been candid about the psychological toll of losing Diana so young. As reported by The Mirror, he disclosed a haunting period after her death when he entertained the possibility that she had staged her demise. His anguish led him to repeatedly drive through the Paris tunnel where Diana’s life was cut short, attempting to make sense of the tragedy.","Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

""The cake was covered with a thick layer of meat floss, so I was just chewing it until I bit into something hard. I immediately spat it out,"" she explained.Initially assuming it was a bad quality, Liu prepared to complain to the bakery.

Dubai has been long celebrated as a global retail haven, and is now making waves in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Known for its expansive malls and top-tier brands, the city is seamlessly blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.Behind the luxurious displays and bespoke offerings lies a layer of AI-powered innovation that’s redefining personalisation, streamlining operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction. From designing jewellery to curating personalised shopping experiences, Dubai is setting new benchmarks in the global retail landscape.In today’s retail environment, customers seek experiences that resonate on a personal level. AI has emerged as the linchpin of this transformation. Amreen Iqbal , Founder and Creative Director of Piece of You, a custom jewellery brand in Dubai, emphasises the depth of this shift: “It’s about understanding the customer deeper—what they want, how they want it, and how we can make it special and unique to each customer. AI helps us do that.”Her brand employs AI-powered tools to enable customers to design unique jewellery pieces through virtual try-ons and bespoke customisation. “The ability to personalise jewellery at this level was unthinkable a few years ago. Now, with AI, it’s a reality,” she adds.Similarly, global e-commerce innovations have gained traction in Dubai. Sue Azari , an e-commerce consultant at, notes, “AI enables highly customised and intuitive customer experiences.”She cites Zalando’s AI-powered chatbot as a perfect example: “If you need an outfit for a Christmas party, you simply describe your needs, and the chatbot curates a complete look, including accessories. It’s like having a personal shopper who knows your wardrobe.”In the beauty sector, major players like Sephora are redefining the customer journey with AI. Through augmented reality (AR) and AI features, their app enables users to virtually try on products like lipstick shades while integrating seamless social sharing options. Azari explains, “It’s about creating an experience, not just a transaction.”Walid BenOthman, Managing Director at Bitpanda, in Dubai, added that AI-driven personalisation has created a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction, revenue, or cost reduction. “Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 customer support, improving engagement and customer satisfaction.”He explained AI has made it easy to bring in hyper-personalised advertisements by analysing customer behaviour, creating more effective campaigns and higher conversion rates.Adding to Dubai’s retail innovation is the launch of theat Dubai Mall, as reported. The AI-powered store enhances the telecom retail experience by offering an array of cutting-edge features. Using AI and robotics, customers can explore products, make payments, and even collect purchases from automated lockers.The store is equipped with advanced facial recognition technology, enabling personalised interactions and tailored product suggestions. It epitomises Dubai’s vision to merge physical retail with AI-driven efficiency. As highlighted in several news reports, this initiative underscores Dubai’s commitment to revolutionising traditional retail through technology. report by GoGlobe has highlighted that Dubai AI’s impact extends beyond personalisation, revolutionising how brands market their products. Generative AI (genAI) has emerged as a game-changer, enabling dynamic, hyper-personalised advertisements and streamlining content creation.“AI doesn’t just generate content; it analyses performance metrics to refine strategies in real-time. It saves marketers countless hours and ensures campaigns are efficient and impactful,” explains Azari.Iqbal highlights AI’s ability to enhance marketing precision through predictive analytics, helping businesses target audiences with unparalleled accuracy. From creating dynamic ads to optimising email campaigns, AI ensures that every touchpoint is relevant and impactful.At Amazon, for instance, AI-generated product descriptions have not only increased efficiency but also improved SEO performance and consistency. “This is not just automation; it’s about making marketing smarter and more strategic,” notes Azari.While customers benefit from AI-driven personalisation, its operational applications are equally transformative. Gavin Jackson, Senior Vice President of Data and AI at Endava, highlights the role of AI in inventory management: “AI has turned inventory management into a science. Retailers can now accurately predict demand, ensuring shelves are stocked without over-ordering. It’s a win for both businesses and consumers.”Jackson explains that AI-powered systems can even trigger additional production when products start selling out, ensuring businesses never miss a sales opportunity.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Identify obvious groups: Start with the most apparent connections, like mythology or objects with specific features.

Use process of elimination: Cross off words as you place them into groups, narrowing the possibilities for the remaining categories.

Think creatively: Some categories require outside-the-box thinking, like interpreting word segments or understanding cultural references.

Learn from mistakes: Each incorrect guess provides clues. Use these to refine your approach for future puzzles.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

What Google said in its arguments

The legal battle between Google and “Fortnite” creator Epic Games takes center stage once again, as lawyers for both companies appear before a US appeals court in California. Google is seeking to overturn a jury verdict and a subsequent judge’s order asking the tech giant to change Play Store practices, as per news agency Reuters.Epic Games initiated the legal proceedings in 2020, accusing Google of monopolistic practices concerning app access on Android devices and in-app transaction processing.Following the jury’s verdict in October last year, Google was ordered to introduce competition by allowing users to download rival app stores directly from Google's Play Store. The order also required Google to make its Play Store app catalog available to these competing app stores, among other significant reforms.However, in court filings submitted to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Google argued that legal errors committed by the trial judge unfairly benefited Epic Games in the antitrust case. The company contends that these errors led to an unjust outcome and warrant the appeals court's intervention.This order is currently on hold pending the 9th Circuit's consideration of Google's appeal.Among multiple other solutions, the tech giant maintained that its Play Store faces robust competition from Apple's App Store and that the judge erred by allowing Epic Games to present the case to jurors as if Google and Apple were not competitors in the app distribution and in-app payment space.Google's appeal also challenges the nationwide scope of Judge Donato's order, arguing that it should have only affected Epic Games specifically, not all users and developers nationwide.Meanwhile, Epic Games, in its response to the appeal, has urged the 9th Circuit to reject Google's arguments. Epic accuses Google of employing a “years-long strategy to suppress competition among app stores and payment solutions.”Reportedly, the company stated that it will “fight to ensure that the jury's verdict and the court's injunction are upheld and Google is held to account for its anticompetitive behavior.”Microsoft has filed a brief in support of Epic Games, as have the US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).","Epic Games initiated the legal proceedings in 2020, accusing Google of monopolistic practices concerning app access on Android devices and in-app transaction processing.

Problems faced by Google’s AI Overviews



Are you tired of Google ’s AI-generated search results? There’s a simple trick to bypass them by adding an expletive to your query. Google’s AI Overviews , which often pull unreliable information, won’t appear if a swear word is included in the search. For example, searching “How large is the student body of IIT Delhi?” generates an AI summary, but tweaking it to “How large is the f***ing student body at IIT Delhi?” removes the AI response, displaying only traditional blue links.We at TOI Tech tried exploiting this loophole which can be helpful for those who prefer unfiltered search results. Take a look at the screenshots below:However, this isn’t the first time internet users have found a way to disable Google’s AI-powered results. Other techniques exist but are more complex, such as appending specific character strings to the search URL. To compare, simply adding an expletive to the query is way easier.This loophole of adding an expletive to a search query to prevent Google from displaying an AI Overview was first spotted by Ars Technica. The report claims that this may be happening due to Google’s strict content policies, which likely train its AI model, Gemini, to avoid repeating profanity. Rather than filtering the response, Google is reportedly disabling the AI summary altogether when a curse word is present.While Google is expected to patch this loophole eventually, for now, users who prefer traditional search results have a simple trick to bypass AI summaries.Google’s AI Overviews have been under scrutiny since their launch, with viral blunders like advising users to use glue to keep cheese from sliding off pizza or eat pebbles for gut health. These responses reportedly stemmed from Reddit comments, highlighting AI’s struggle to detect sarcasm and satire.Google AI summaries may also risk amplifying misinformation by presenting flawed responses as authoritative. The issue extends beyond Google search to voice assistants like Siri now defaults to AI-generated answers using ChatGPT, sometimes delivering incorrect information instead of admitting uncertainty.Google defends AI Overviews by claiming they drive traffic to original sources and argues that users will explore linked articles after reading the summaries. However, some companies remain sceptical, with lawsuits against AI firms like OpenAI and Perplexity for allegedly scraping their content.","Google’s AI Overviews won’t appear if a swear word is included in the search.

Wisconsin - Wisconsin Cheese Mart: Gemini in Google Docs

A major factual error in Google's Super Bowl commercial has prompted Google Cloud apps president Jerry Dischler to defend Gemini AI's accuracy, claiming the disputed information was ""not a hallucination"" but rather ""grounded in the Web.""The controversy centers on Gemini AI's claim that Gouda cheese represents ""50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption"" - a statistic that cheese experts say is significantly inflated.The statement appeared in Google's Super Bowl campaign in the US showcasing how small businesses use Gemini AI across all fifty states.Dischler’s reply comes to a user on X (formerly Twitter), who weighed in on the ad, noting that Gemini is stating a wrong fact in the ad. “In Google's Wisconsin local Super Bowl ad, an AI hallucination is shown on screen: It says *Gouda* accounts for ""50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption. Gemini provides no source, but that is just unequivocally false,” reads the post. “Cheddar & mozzarella would like a word”Cornell University's E.V. Baker Professor of Agricultural Economics Emeritus, Andrew Novakovic , disputes the accuracy of this claim. ""While Gouda is likely the most common single variety in world trade, it is almost assuredly not the most widely consumed,"" Novakovic explained to The Verge, noting that Indian Paneer and fresh cheeses from South America, Africa, and Asia likely have much larger consumption volumes globally.While the commercial includes a fine-print disclaimer stating ""This is a creative writing aid, and is not intended to be factual,"" critics argue this raises concerns about Gemini's reliability for business applications, especially since the ad depicts a business owner using the tool to generate website content.Responding to the backlash, Dischler defended the statistic on X, citing its appearance on multiple websites, including Cheese.com - though the credibility of this source has been questioned in online discussions dating back over a decade.","Gemini AI claims that Gouda cheese represents ""50 to 60 percent of the world's cheese consumption"" This statistic has been disputed by cheese experts.
