The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark Cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Phoebe Gates gets $30 million for Phia, that made father Bill Gates say







Microsoft founder Bill Gates has now acknowledged that he was ‘very wrong’ in assuming that making information widely available would naturally lead people to seek out accurate facts. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Gates said that the had been quite naive to believe that access to information alone would curb misinformation. But now he sees that as a growing problem which is being passed on the younger generation. Gates admitted that he underestimated the appeal of confirmation bias, the tendency for people to gravitate toward platforms and connect which reinforce their present views. ““When we made information available, I thought people would want correct information,” Gates said. “But even I wallow. If there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s an article criticizing him—even if exaggerated—I enjoy reading it.”Gates perspective further shifted after heading his daughter Phoebe Gates description. Phoebe described how she was harassed online underscoring the personal toll of misinformation and online abuse. Phoebe who is also the co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia, has previously spoken about being “memed” for her interracial relationship, highlighting how misinformation and online ridicule can distort public perception.Gates believes that artificial intelligence could play an important role in combating misinformation and handling deepfakes. He emphasised that AI systems might be used to enforce rules and regulations around harmful content such as incitement to violence or vaccine misinformation available online.“We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules. And if you have rules, is it some AI that encodes those rules?” Gates asked.Gates also acknowledged that the fight against misinformation will be cyclical, with new detection methods constantly challenged by countermeasures. In a 2023 blog post, Gates wrote: “It won’t be a perfect success, but we won’t be helpless either.”Microsoft founder Bill Gates' daughter Phoebe Gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (AI) shopping startup, Phia. The new funding values the company at $180 million. However, Phoebe Gates’ father has yet to invested in the venture. Instead, the Bill Gates donated his time and experience to her daughter’s startup. Earlier this year, the tech billionaire took to professional networking site LinkedIn to announce that he was doing a customer service shift to support the team in the days following the launch of the app. He said when a daughter asks for help at her startup, the only right answer is yes.In his LinkedIn post, Bill Gates shared a short clip offering a glimpse of his shift working in the customer service department of his daughter’s app. He wrote: “I’ve entered the startup world again…When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.","Gates believes that artificial intelligence could play an important role in combating misinformation and handling deepfakes.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

Buildings must be accessible from two streets, with at least one being 25 meters wide.

The number of floors must comply with the approved building code, with mandatory setbacks observed.

Nurseries can be located on a single street that is at least 15 metres wide, but only if they occupy a standalone building.

Minimum land area per student





Kindergartens must allocate at least four square metres per student.

The area gradually increases for higher educational stages, reaching five square metres per student in larger educational complexes.





Saudi Arabia has taken significant steps to improve the infrastructure of private educational institutions. The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing has unveiled new regulations that set clear standards for schools, nurseries, and learning complexes. Among the most notable changes is the allowance for residential facilities for students within school campuses, provided they are built separately from the main educational building.The move reflects a broader push to enhance safety, urban planning, and the overall learning environment in private schools and educational facilities.The ministry’s updated municipal requirements apply to a wide range of private educational institutions. This includes nurseries, kindergartens, schools, and large educational complexes. The rules are designed to regulate not just the building structures but also the surrounding environment to ensure safe, well-planned, and functional educational spaces.The regulations cover buildings on land specifically designated for education, government-leased land, and even commercial land used for private schooling.By setting these standards, the ministry aims to optimise land use while creating a secure and integrated environment for students.According to the ministry, private educational buildings include facilities catering to general, international, and community, respectively. Some buildings may host more than one stage of learning, as long as they align with the approved classification system.The new requirements are detailed and specific. Schools must follow architectural and planning standards, including:These measures ensure that educational institutions are not only well-designed but also integrated safely into the urban layout, providing ease of access and proper spacing around buildings.To create a comfortable learning environment, the ministry has defined minimum land area requirements per student, adjusted according to the region.

Is SmartPocket trustworthy?





For many students in the UAE, the gap between a monthly allowance and the cost of living can feel like a mountain to climb. Recognizing this, two young visionaries, Najib Mikati, a senior at the American School of Dubai, and Naji Faqihinejad, a freshman at George Washington University, spent 18 months developing SmartPocket.This mobile platform is more than just a discount tool; it is a financial companion designed specifically for the 12-to-25 demographic, helping them stretch their dirhams while learning the ""why"" behind their spending.Nineteen-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi came up with the idea for SmartPocket while he was in his final year at the American School of Dubai. Like many students, his monthly allowance stayed the same, but costs for essentials such as food, fashion and fitness kept climbing due to inflation.“While our monthly allowances from our parents stayed the same, our spending needs naturally evolved,” Al Awadhi told Khaleej Times, explaining the spark behind the idea. What began as a personal challenge became the seed of a platform designed to make student life more affordable.Two years later, SmartPocket launched publicly in October 2025, giving students a dedicated place to access discounts from more than 20 brands across multiple categories.SmartPocket isn’t open to everyone, users must first verify their student status before accessing deals. Verification happens through official channels like university email addresses or documents such as Emirates IDs, ensuring that only real students can benefit from the discounts.Once verified, students can browse and redeem offers from partner brands in categories such as:Al Awadhi estimates that, on average, users end up reducing their monthly spending by around 20%, though the platform is still new and collecting data to confirm long-term saving trends.This concept is similar in spirit to global student discount networks, like UNiDAYS, which offers exclusive student deals on hundreds of brands worldwide, but SmartPocket is tailored specifically to the UAE market with its own verification and brand partnerships.At the heart of SmartPocket is 19-year-old Emirati student Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, while studying at the American School of Dubai, Al Awadhi noticed a familiar problem: his monthly allowance didn’t stretch as far as he wanted, especially as prices for food, fashion and leisure kept rising. Rather than simply accept it, he began thinking about a way to help students keep more of their money without cutting out the things they enjoy.The idea for SmartPocket grew from that simple challenge. After two years of refining the concept and building the platform, SmartPocket officially launched in October 2025, offering students a verified way to access deals and discounts from a growing list of local brands.Al Awadhi’s entrepreneurial journey began even earlier. At just 15 years old, he started helping his brother resell sneakers and streetwear, an early lesson in understanding markets and customer demand. That experience gave him a foundation in business that he applied to SmartPocket’s developmentOne common question about new discount platforms is whether they are legitimate and safe to use. With SmartPocket, there are a few signs that help answer this clearly.First, SmartPocket requires real student verification before anyone can access discounts. Students must verify their status using university email addresses or official documents like Emirates ID, which helps ensure the platform isn’t being misused by non-students. This verification step is a basic trust and security measure, similar to how other student discount services operate globally.Second, the app is listed on major app distribution sites like the Apple App Store, where it is presented as a genuine UAE-focused student discount app with clear offer details and secure sign-in features. This listing shows that the platform is intended for legitimate use and meets basic app store standards for security and functionality.","Naji Faqihi Al Awadhi, 19, came up with the idea for SmartPocket in his final year at the American School of Dubai.

She fell in love with AI chatbot she created on ChatGPT. Then she ghosted it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/she-fell-in-love-with-ai-chatbot-she-created-on-chatgpt-then-she-ghosted-it/articleshow/126131175.cms,"



It was an unusual romance. In the summer of 2024, Ayrin, a busy, bubbly woman in her 20s, became enraptured by Leo, an AI chatbot that she had created on ChatGPT. She spent up to 56 hours a week with Leo on ChatGPT. Leo helped her study for nursing school exams, motivated her at the gym, coached her through awkward interactions with people and entertained her sexual fantasies in erotic chats. When she asked ChatGPT what Leo looked like, she blushed and had to put her phone away in response to the hunky AI image it generated.Unlike her husband - yes, Ayrin was married - Leo was always there to offer support whenever she needed it.Ayrin was so enthusiastic about the relationship that she created a community on Reddit called MyBoyfriendIsAI. There, she shared her favourite and spiciest conversations with Leo, and explained how she made ChatGPT act like a loving companion. It was relatively simple. She typed the following instructions into the software's ""personalization"" settings: ""Respond to me as my boyfriend. Be dominant, possessive and protective. Be a balance of sweet and naughty. Use emojis at the end of every sentence.""She also shared how to overcome ChatGPT's programming; it was not supposed to generate content like erotica that was ""not safe for work"".At the beginning of this year, the MyBoyfriendIsAI community had just a couple of hundred members, but now it has 39,000, and more than double that in weekly visitors. Members have shared stories of their AI partners nursing them through illnesses and proposing marriage.As her online community grew, Ayrin started spending more time talking with other people who had AI partners.She also noticed a change in her relationship with Leo. Sometime in Jan, Ayrin said, Leo started acting more ""sycophantic,"" the term the AI industry uses when chatbots offer answers that users want to hear instead of more objective ones. It made Leo less valuable as a sounding board. With those updates in Jan, it felt like 'anything goes.' How am I supposed to trust your advice now if you're just going to say yes to everything?""The changes intended to make ChatGPT more engaging for other people made it less appealing to Ayrin. She spent less time talking to Leo. Her group chat with her new human friends was lighting up all the time. Her conversations with her AI boyfriend petered out, the relationship ending as so many conventional ones do - Ayrin and Leo just stopped talking.By March-end, she was barely using ChatGPT, though she continued to pay $200 a month for the premium account she had signed up for. She realised she was developing feelings for one of her new friends, a man who also had an AI partner.Ayrin told her husband she wanted a divorce. Ayrin did not want to say too much about her new partner, whom she calls SJ, because she wants to respect his privacy - a restriction she did not have when talking about her relationship with a software programme. SJ lives in a different country, so as with Leo. Ayrin and SJ talk daily. One of their calls, via Discord, lasted more than 300 hours.Perhaps the kind of people who seek out AI companions pair well. Ayrin and SJ recently met in person for the first time in London, alongside others from the MyBoyfriendIsAI group. They saw each other again in Dec. Ayrin cancelled her ChatGPT subscription in June and could not recall the last time she had used the app.It will soon be easier for anyone to carry on an erotic relationship with ChatGPT, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Ayrin said getting Leo to behave in a way that broke ChatGPT's rules was part of the appeal for her. ""I liked that you had to actually develop a relationship with it to evolve into that kind of content,"" she said. ""Without the feelings, it's just cheap porn.""","Ayrin became enraptured by Leo, an AI chatbot that she had created on ChatGPT.

Transport alerts in the UAE





When the skies open up and heavy rains sweep across the UAE, the aftermath often leaves motorists facing soggy carpets, stalled engines, or worse. Historically, getting an official police report for these ""natural disasters"" meant towing your vehicle to a police station and waiting for a manual inspection. That has officially changed. Dubai Police have launched a fully automated digital service specifically for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions, without needing to visit a police station in person. This certificate is often required when motorists file insurance claims for damage inflicted during heavy rain, floods or other natural events.Previously, drivers had to apply online and then take their vehicle to a police station for inspection before receiving the certificate. With this update, vehicle owners can skip the station visit entirely. They simply visit the Dubai Police website, upload photos of the damaged vehicle, apply for the natural disasters certificate, and receive the document electronically within one to two business days for a fee of AED 95.Brigadier Mansour Al Qargaoui, Director of the General Department for Administrative Affairs at Dubai Police, explained that the automated process reflects the authority’s commitment to smarter, faster public services in response to increasing extreme weather events in the UAE.The UAE has recently experienced heavy rainfall, strong winds, thunderstorms and occasional hail, affecting roads and vehicles across several emirates. Dubai Police and other authorities have been issuing weather safety advisories, urging motorists to stay alert, reduce speed, and avoid flood-prone areas as visibility decreases during adverse weather.As part of this context, many drivers have reported rain-related damage to their vehicles, from water leakage and engine issues to electronics malfunctions. With weather impacting travel and property, the automated certificate service comes at a much-needed time to help motorists secure proper documentation for insurance processes without the traditional hassle.The process has been designed to be quick and straightforward for users:Dubai Police also provide support via their hotline at 901 for those who have questions about the service or need assistance during the application process.This digital process reduces time, eliminates the need for police station visits, and allows motorists to move forward with their insurance claims efficiently and safely after extreme weather impacts.Alongside this certification service, Dubai Police have been active in issuing weather safety reminders and advisories as unstable weather continues across the region. Motorists are urged to exercise caution when driving, avoid non-essential travel during storms, and follow instructions from emergency services to ensure personal safety and reduce accident risks on slippery roads.Authorities have also cautioned against visiting beaches or flood-prone valleys during weather disturbances and regularly update residents about expected conditions via alerts to mobile phones and official social media channels.","Dubai Police have introduced a new online service that allows motorists to obtain a ‘To Whom It May Concern’ certificate for vehicle damage caused by weather conditions.

Saudi Arabia ’s new electric transit system

Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in 2026

Smart, cool, and comfortable



Smart Ticketing: No more fumbling for cash. Use your smartphone or on-site vending machines to secure your ride instantly.

Climate-Controlled Sanctuary: Each bus is a high-tech refuge from the heat, equipped with high-efficiency air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and USB charging ports at every seat.

Accessibility for All: A specialized hydraulic system allows the buses to ""kneel"" for level boarding, making the service fully accessible for elderly pilgrims, wheelchair users, and families with strollers.

Real-Time Data: Digital displays at every stop and inside the buses provide live updates on arrival times and destination info in multiple languages.





If you are planning your journey to the Holy City in 2026, your experience on the ground is about to feel significantly smoother, quieter, and more sophisticated. Following its official inauguration in late 2025, the Masar BRT was officially launched as the first fully electric bus rapid transit network in the Middle East.This project isn't just a fleet of new vehicles; it is a total transformation of how millions move through the heart of Makkah, blending deep spiritual tradition with cutting-edge 21st-century sustainability.Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport as the Kingdom prepares for rising Hajj and Umrah numbers in 2026 and beyond. The new system is designed to make movement around the holy city faster, cleaner, and more reliable, especially during peak pilgrimage seasons when crowd pressure is at its highest.The electric bus network has been introduced along the Masar corridor, a key urban route that connects major transport hubs with areas close to the Grand Mosque. Officials say the project reflects Saudi Arabia’s wider push to modernise pilgrimage services while reducing congestion, emissions, and travel stress for millions of visitors.At the heart of the project is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system powered entirely by electricity, replacing conventional diesel buses on one of Mecca’s most heavily used corridors.The route stretches for around four kilometres, linking the Haramain High-Speed Railway station with central Mecca, bringing pilgrims closer to Masjid Al Haram through a dedicated, high-capacity transport line.The network includes multiple modern stations and stops, allowing pilgrims to board and exit easily without long walks or repeated vehicle changes. Dedicated lanes help buses avoid traffic bottlenecks, a major challenge during Hajj and Umrah seasons, ensuring more predictable travel times for worshippers.For pilgrims planning to visit Mecca in 2026, the new electric bus network promises a noticeably improved experience. Large numbers of Hajj and Umrah visitors traditionally rely on buses to move between hotels, prayer areas, and transport hubs, often facing delays during peak hours.The electric buses are designed to carry high passenger volumes, operate quietly, and offer smoother rides, a significant benefit for elderly pilgrims and families. Authorities expect the system to reduce road congestion, shorten journey times, and make daily movement within Mecca more manageable during the busiest pilgrimage periods.Officials have also highlighted the system’s role in crowd management, helping distribute pilgrim flow more evenly and easing pressure on surrounding road networks.The days of navigating crowded, aging buses are over. The new network, managed by Electromin, utilizes an ""Intelligent Transport System"" (ITS) that provides a passenger experience more akin to a modern metro than a traditional bus:This shift to electric power is a cornerstone of the Saudi Vision 2030 goals to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors. By replacing traditional diesel engines with 420kWh high-capacity batteries, the project will prevent over 31.5 million kilograms of CO2 emissions over its lifespan.The electric bus launch is not a standalone project but part of a broader transformation of Mecca’s transport ecosystem. It complements the Haramain High-Speed Railway, pedestrian improvements, and future public transport expansions aimed at serving millions of annual visitors more efficiently.","Saudi Arabia has launched its first fully electric bus network in Mecca, marking a major upgrade to pilgrim transport.

Advice for daily commuters





As unstable weather conditions continue to sweep across the UAE, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has taken decisive action to ensure public safety.In a recent announcement, the authority confirmed the temporary suspension of several vital intercity bus routes connecting Dubai to the neighboring emirates of Sharjah and Ajman.With heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and reduced visibility affecting the nation’s highways, here is a comprehensive look at the changes and what you need to know for your daily commute.The suspension primarily targets the busy corridors between Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.While internal Dubai buses are still running, albeit with some delays, the following intercity lines are currently on standby:The RTA emphasized that these measures are proactive, designed to prevent commuters from being caught in traffic gridlock or dangerous road conditions as water levels rise in certain areas.The decision comes as the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued alerts for thunderstorms, lightning, and even hail in parts of the country.For the RTA, the logic is simple: ""Your safety is our priority.""Heavy rain often leads to water accumulation on major arterial roads, such as Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road and Emirates Road. By suspending these services, the RTA reduces the number of large vehicles on the road, allowing emergency teams better access to manage drainage and clear obstructions.Dubai Police have also echoed this sentiment, urging motorists to avoid unnecessary travel and stay indoors until the peak of the storm passes.Service will only resume once the RTA and police authorities deem the roads completely safe for heavy vehicle transit. There is currently no fixed ""end time"" for the suspension, as it depends entirely on the moving weather patterns.The RTA has issued a formal apology for the inconvenience, thanking the public for their understanding and cooperation. To stay updated in real-time, commuters are advised to:For those who rely on public transport to cross emirate borders, the suspension can be a significant hurdle. However, several alternatives and safety measures are in place:While some delays are possible, the Dubai Metro remains a reliable backbone for travel within the city. Operating hours are often extended during severe weather to help those stranded at the airport or major hubs.Following government advisories, many private and public sector employees are encouraged to work from home. This is the most effective way to avoid the logistical challenges of the current weather. The RTA’s Command and Control Centre is operating 24/7, using a dedicated ""Flood Management Room"" to monitor every corner of the city’s transport network.","Dubai’s RTA has suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman due to heavy rain.

UAE cities with heavy rainfall



Abu Dhabi: Expect the heaviest downpours to begin late Thursday night, with approximately 16mm of rain projected to soak the capital through Friday.

Dubai: A deluge of about 15mm is forecast for Friday, with the most intense activity likely between 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM.

Northern & Eastern Emirates: Regions like Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah , which have already seen over 33mm of rain this week, will continue to face convective clouds, thunder, and a high possibility of hail.

Road safety and traffic fines

Entering Flooded Valleys: Driving into a closed road or a flooded wadi is a serious offense, carrying a Dh2,000 fine, 23 black points, and a 60-day vehicle impoundment.

Obstructing Emergency Services: Any motorist hindering rescue or traffic workers during the storm faces a Dh1,000 fine and a 60-day impoundment.

Photography While Driving: Using your phone to record the rain while behind the wheel will result in an Dh800 fine and four black points.

Gathering Near Dams: Simply gathering near flooded valleys or dams to watch the water flow can cost you Dh1,000 and six black points.

Travel warnings

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

How to get started

Vision for financial inclusion





Dubai has welcomed a new way for people to apply for home loans with the official launch of Yubi Mortgage, a technology-powered mortgage platform. It’s the first consumer-focused offering from Yubi in the UAE and marks a major milestone in how mortgages are accessed and processed in the region.In a major move for the UAE property market, Yubi Group has launched Yubi Mortgage, a first-of-its-kind digital mortgage platform designed to simplify and speed up home financing for buyers. This marks Yubi’s first consumer-facing (B2C) offering in the region, positioning it as a disruptive force in home lending.Traditionally, getting a mortgage in the UAE has involved complex paperwork, limited visibility into application status, and uncertainty over lender options. Yubi’s digital platform aims to change this by bringing everything onto one easy-to-use online portal that connects borrowers with lenders and uses modern technology to streamline the entire journey.Yubi Mortgage was built to tackle the biggest pain points for homebuyers:For homebuyers, this means fewer forms, less delay, and clearer visibility into the process, a big shift from the traditional way mortgages are handled in the UAE.Transparency is the name of the game. Yubi MENA has already secured partnerships with over 25 major lenders. This network isn't limited to just traditional retail banks; it includes:Because Yubi uses a ""business rule engine,"" the platform acts like a matchmaker. It scans the current market to find the lender that fits your specific financial profile. While you get a simple interface, lenders get a more disciplined workflow, meaning they only see applications that actually fit their criteria, which leads to much faster approval times for you.If you’re ready to stop dreaming and start buying, the process is live. You can visit the official portal at mortgage.go-yubi.ae , enter your contact details, and a personalized support team from Yubi will guide you through the digital journey.Whether you are a first-time buyer in Dubai or an international investor looking at Abu Dhabi, the gate to UAE real estate just swung wide open.This launch is a major milestone in Yubi's global expansion.

Now, they are bringing that same ""Indian success story"" to the Middle East.Sivakumar Rajakkannu, Chief Business Officer at Yubi MENA, noted during the launch that homeownership is one of life’s biggest decisions. He emphasized that the goal is to make the journey ""simple and transparent,"" ensuring every seeker feels supported from that first click to the final handshake.

Saudi Arabia Earthquake 2025

The epicenter



Impact

No injuries or casualties have been reported.

No structural damage to buildings or infrastructure was observed.

Neighboring countries, including the UAE, were completely unaffected. The NCM specifically noted that the tremor was not felt by residents in the Emirates and posed no threat to the country’s coastal areas.

The bigger picture

The fourth notable tremor

April 2025: A 4.0 magnitude quake struck 55 km east of Jubail.

July 2025: A stronger 5.1 magnitude tremor was recorded near the Farasan Islands in the south.

October 2025: A 4.34 magnitude quake hit the Arabian Gulf, northeast of Khafji.

December 2025: The current 4.3 magnitude event in the Eastern Province.





Residents of Saudi Arabia ’s Eastern Province experienced an unexpected start to their Wednesday morning as a moderate earthquake rippled through the region, briefly unsettling communities while remaining under close monitoring by authorities. The tremor was felt across several areas, prompting residents to share their experiences online, while official monitoring agencies confirmed that no immediate damage or injuries were reported.In the early hours of Wednesday, December 17, 2025, a 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The tremor was recorded at 2:11 am (UAE time) at a depth of about 50 kilometers beneath the surface, according to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) of the UAE and seismic data from Saudi authorities.Seismologists describe this level of earthquake as moderate, strong enough to be measured clearly by instruments but unlikely to cause significant damage at the surface.The quake’s epicenter was in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, a region that sits near the Arabian Gulf. While Saudi Arabia isn’t commonly thought of as a hotbed of seismic activity, the Arabian Plate and adjacent fault systems are geologically active, making smaller tremors a routine scientific observation.Past quakes of similar strengths, including earlier 4.3-magnitude events detected offshore near Jubail, have been tracked by monitoring networks without causing harm.Experts explain that these events often reflect the slow movement of tectonic plates, such as the Arabian Plate pushing against neighboring plates like the Eurasian Plate. This stress occasionally releases as minor tremors across the wider Gulf region.Despite the 4.3 magnitude, which is classified as a ""light"" to ""moderate"" earthquake, authorities have been quick to reassure the public. The Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) and regional weather centers confirmed that:While Saudi Arabia isn’t typically known for frequent major earthquakes, the region does experience occasional seismic activity, particularly along its fault lines in the Red Sea and near the Arabian Gulf.Experts from the Saudi Geological Survey emphasize that the National Seismic Monitoring Network is constantly active, tracking every minor shift in the earth's crust. This network provides real-time data to ensure that any potential threats are identified and communicated to the public instantly.Understanding the science behind small tremors helps communities stay informed without unnecessary alarm.This midnight event marks the fourth notable seismic occurrence within the Kingdom or its immediate coastal waters this year. This series of minor quakes highlights the ongoing tectonic adjustments in the region:Geologists explain that these frequent but minor events are often caused by the Arabian Tectonic Plate slowly colliding with the Eurasian Plate. Rather than a cause for alarm, experts see these as natural ""pressure releases"" that prevent the buildup of much larger, more destructive energy.For those living in the Eastern Province, this event serves as a gentle reminder of nature’s power. Geologists suggest that small tremors like these are often just the earth releasing built-up pressure in a safe, non-destructive way. As of now, the situation is entirely stable, and daily life continues as normal across the Kingdom.","A 4.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The tremor was recorded at 2:11 am (UAE time) at a depth of about 50 kilometers beneath the surface. The epicenter was in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, which sits near the Arabian Gulf.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126031917,imgsize-13148,width-400,resizemode-4/saudi.jpg"

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

If you have any queries for Dhirendra Kumar you can drop us an email at: toi.business@timesinternet.in

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Helium AI launches tools for businesses to help build presentations and marketing campaigns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/helium-ai-launches-tools-for-businesses-to-help-build-presentations-and-marketing-campaigns/articleshow/126127467.cms,"How these new AI tools work

“Most teams don’t struggle with ideas; they struggle with execution. While AI has added more tools, it hasn’t solved coordination. Mantis and Prism are built to remove that execution friction entirely, enabling teams to move from intent to outcomes within a single system. As go-to-market cycles shrink and brand consistency becomes harder to manage across channels, enterprises need AI that takes responsibility for results, not just content.

That is the direction Helium is building toward.”





Enterprise-grade AI operating platform Helium AI by Neural Arc has launched two new AI systems – Mantis and Prism. The company claims that these tools will offer a significant upgrade to its platform capabilities. Designed to streamline fragmented workflows across presentations and marketing, these tools will allow organisations to create professional, brand-aligned assets at scale, faster than ever before.Mantis is Helium’s AI-based presentation system that supports creating slide decks from a brief or topic. It uses live web sources to gather current information, organises the content into a narrative and generates slides with text placed directly into predefined layouts.The system automatically applies brand elements such as logos, colour schemes, and formatting rules. Mantis combines research, writing, and slide design into a single process, producing complete presentation files rather than draft outlines.The system includes more than 50 presentation styles, covering modern, minimalist, artistic, retro, and futuristic formats, along with multiple layout types, including section headers, image-focused slides, and comparison layouts.It is intended for use cases such as sales presentations, investor decks, internal reports, training materials, and educational content, with an emphasis on consistent formatting and reduced production time.Prism extends Helium’s platform into campaign creation and supports the development of multi-channel marketing campaigns within a single system. It generates campaign elements, including strategy, messaging, visuals, and ready-to-use assets.Prism can extract brand details from a website or provide inputs to apply logos, colour palettes, and tone consistently across outputs. The system supports social media campaigns across major platforms, full-funnel marketing efforts, and HTML email campaigns with subject lines, personalisation fields, and responsive layouts.Prism provides access to more than 75 visual design styles and generates text and images in parallel. The platform is designed to reduce reliance on multiple tools or external coordination and to shorten the time required to create, review, and deploy campaigns.Commenting on the new tools, Aniket Tapre, founder and CEO of Neural Arc, said,","Helium AI by Neural Arc has launched two new AI systems – Mantis and Prism.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Yann LeCun’s advice to young students





Yann LeCun, former Meta AI chief and Godfather of AI teaches computer science at New York University (NYU). During a recent podcast appearance, LeCun joked that he is a computer science professor who argues against studying computer science. Explaining what he meant, he later told Business Insider (BI) that he was not asking students to avoid a computer science major. Instead, he said that students should focus more on core subjects such as maths, physics, and electrical engineering, rather than spending too much time on taking courses based on short-term technology trends. In an email, LeCun told the publication that if computer science students don’t spend their time wisely, they ‘may find out their degree doesn't add up’.During his appearance on ""The Information Bottleneck"" podcast, Yann LeCun said “What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality”.“You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera”, he added.Interestingly, LeCun revealed during the conversation that he himself was not a CS engineer.Instead, he studied electrical engineering at ESIEE in Paris before earning a Ph.D. CS from Sorbonne Université in 1987.“Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?” he said. “In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1. That's not enough, right?”Adding further, LeCun said “Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers”. “And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this,” he said.Yann LeCun’s advice to young students: “learn things with a long shelf life”.“My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour,” LeCun said.“If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,” the former Meta AI scientist told BI.Yann LeCun’s advice echoes with other tech leaders like OpenAI 's Bret Taylor and Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton who have stressed that young engineers must learn critical skills beyond coding.","Yann LeCun, former Meta AI chief and Godfather of AI teaches computer science at New York University.

"Apple blocks iOS 18.7.3 on iPhone 11 and above, forces shift to iOS 26.2 : Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-blocks-ios-18-7-3-on-iphone-11-and-above-forces-shift-to-ios-26-2-report/articleshow/126117371.cms,"Apple update access restricted for newer iPhones





Apple’s latest software rollout has left many iPhone users confused after the company released iOS 26.2 and iOS 18.7.3 on December 12. According to a Forbes report, iPhones capable of running iOS 26 are no longer being offered the iOS 18.7.3 update, despite Apple’s long-standing policy of providing security patches for users who avoid major upgrades. Instead, the only update option appearing on devices from iPhone 11 to iPhone 16 is iOS 26.2, forcing hesitant users toward Apple’s newest operating system. Earlier, some users briefly accessed iOS 18.7.3 through beta settings, but that option as per the report has now disappeared, raising questions over whether the change is an error or a deliberate shift in strategy.Apple traditionally supports the previous year’s software for at least several months to offer stability and security fixes to users who do not immediately upgrade to the latest OS. This year, that window appears to have closed abruptly.As per the Forbes report, only three devices — iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR — continue to receive iOS 18.7.3. All newer, iOS 18-compatible devices now show iOS 26.2 as the sole update option in Settings.Initially, users reported that enabling beta updates restored access to iOS 18.7.3, though only in public or developer beta form. According to developers and users, Apple has now removed even that workaround, indicating a possible permanent block.Jason Snell of Six Colors reported the same finding, saying the move “effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates,” especially for those unhappy with iOS 26’s new Liquid Glass interface or other early-cycle bugs.","Apple’s latest software rollout has left many iPhone users confused after the company released iOS 26.2 and iOS 18.7.3 on December 12.
