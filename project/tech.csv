Kayla Nicole’s journey from being judged to being empowered

Welcome to The Pre-Game

Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce , shedding light on how not just he but other past partners treated her harshly. In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success. In a recent episode, she recalled a college relationship with a then-NBA hopeful a man she supported, only to have him dim her own ambitions in return. It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, she said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. She stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.","Kayla Nicole opened up on her new podcast The Pre-Game.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial.

Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The moderator has asked users to check for Roku OS updates if their YouTube TV app has disappeared.Several affected users also noted that updating to a newer OS version restores the YouTube TV app. However, as the exact cause remains unclear, this fix suggests that the issue may lie with Roku. It can be possibly related to how the Roku store functions on older OS versions, the report noted.One users took to Reddit to noted: “The app icon disappeared from my list of apps, and I'm unable to add it back in to my list. Reset the TV already, will stream from phone onto TV until fixed.”“I wanted to watch YouTube TV on our Roku TV , but when I looked for it, it had suddenly disappeared. When I searched for it through the app search function, it was still there, but I could not open it. When I restarted it came back for a second but then disappeared again.

Despite her vocal talent, catchy songs, and major label backing, Hailee Steinfeld continues to struggle

So, what’s holding Hailee Steinfeld back?

Hailee Steinfeld burst onto the scene with an Oscar nomination at just 14, and since then, she’s proven herself as a triple threat—actor, singer, and style icon. But nearly a decade after her debut single “Love Myself” made waves, a question still lingers in the pop world: Is Hailee Steinfeld taken seriously as a pop star?There’s no denying Hailee Steinfeld's talent. She’s got the vocals, the looks, and a catalog of underrated hits like “Starving,” “Most Girls,” and “Wrong Direction.” Her voice is clean and radio-friendly, and her sound sits comfortably between mainstream pop and synth-pop. She’s worked with producers like Zedd and Grey, and opened for heavyweights such as Katy Perry. But despite all that, Steinfeld hasn’t quite broken into the A-list tier of pop stardom occupied by artists like Dua Lipa, Olivia Rodrigo, or even fellow actor-turned-singer Selena Gomez Part of the issue may be branding and consistency. While her acting career has thrived—with roles in Pitch Perfect, Dickinson, and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse—her music releases have often felt sporadic. Fans never quite know if she’s fully committed to her music or if it’s just a side project between films. That lack of clear musical identity can make it hard to build a dedicated pop audience.Another factor is industry perception. As a successful actress, Steinfeld often gets boxed into the “celebrity-turned-singer” category, where skepticism runs high. Unlike artists who came up purely through music, she has to constantly prove her legitimacy in a genre that demands authenticity.The irony is that Steinfeld’s music—lyrically honest, emotionally resonant, and polished—is exactly what the pop world claims to value. But without a full-length album and more consistent promotion, she risks being forgotten amid a fast-moving industry.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld presses pause on wedding plans as she fully commits to promoting her upcoming film ‘Sinners’ Hailee Steinfeld has the ingredients of a true pop star. The question now is whether the industry, and perhaps even she herself, is ready to fully commit to that version of her.

Abdul Carter and NFL Draft: Why the Giants shouldn’t overlook Penn State’s defensive phenom



Why Abdul Carter would transform the Giants defense

The 2025 NFL Draft may be quarterback-heavy, with names like Cam Ward, Shedeur Sanders , and Jaxson Dart dominating headlines, but there's a growing buzz around a defensive juggernaut who’s quietly building a compelling case as a top-three selection: Abdul Carter . A name that might not yet echo in the same frequency as the quarterbacks, Carter is emerging as the type of player that can redefine a franchise—not just complement it.While the NFL draft process is often quarterback-centric, Abdul Carter’s rise is no fluke. The Big Ten’s 2024 Defensive Player of the Year, Carter has established himself as one of the most feared edge rushers in college football. He didn’t just have a good season—he had a dominant one. Starting all 16 games, Carter racked up 68 total tackles, an eye-popping 24 tackles for loss, and 12.0 sacks, alongside two forced fumbles. Those are the kind of numbers that scream first-round impact, especially in a league where disrupting the quarterback is as valuable as throwing the football.Carter brings more than just stats. He carries the rare blend of confidence and purpose that NFL front offices crave. Speaking at the NFL scouting combine in February, he stated, “You definitely need a franchise edge rusher. If you look at all the great teams – all the great teams that have won Super Bowls – you have that one standout, great defensive player. And I feel like I’m that.” That’s not arrogance—it’s clarity of purpose. And in today’s NFL, he’s not wrong.For a franchise like the New York Giants, who own the No. 3 overall pick, this isn’t just about filling needs—it’s about investing in transformational talent. Sure, the Giants already boast names like Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux off the edge, but this is the kind of draft where positional depth shouldn't cloud elite potential. When you’re drafting this high, you don’t reach for positional fit—you take the best player available. And there’s a growing belief across NFL circles that Abdul Carter could be just that.History has shown the Giants’ blueprint for success leans heavily on defensive disruption. Their Super Bowl-winning teams in 2007 and 2011 weren’t just led by Eli Manning’s clutch performances—they were fueled by relentless defensive lines featuring Michael Strahan, Osi Umenyiora, and Justin Tuck. Adding a game-wrecker like Carter into the fold could replicate that blueprint for success and elevate the Giants’ defense to another tier.Despite not participating in any measurable drills at the NFL Combine or Penn State’s Pro Day, Carter’s tape does the talking. His explosive first step, relentless motor, and ability to bend around the edge make him a nightmare for offensive tackles. Even more impressive is his football IQ—knowing when to drop into coverage or knife through the line to collapse the pocket. He’s not just a pass rusher; he’s a complete defender with the upside of becoming a franchise cornerstone.The draft is always a gamble—some picks become Peyton Manning, others JaMarcus Russell. But if there’s one non-quarterback prospect this year who seems like the safest bet to deliver day-one impact, it might be Abdul Carter. He may not be the headline act right now, but rest assured, he’ll be the storyline soon enough.Also Read: NFL world waits as Aaron Rodgers keeps Steelers and retirement decisions hanging in balance",Penn State's Abdul Carter is emerging as a top-three pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.

Could the Steelers finally give Aaron Rodgers the weapon he always deserved?



Steelers Rumors: Aaron Rodgers Latest + Jets SHOPPING Breece Hall & Releasing Allen Lazard?

The Pittsburgh Steelers stand on the edge of a potentially transformative decision—one that could rewrite the final chapter of Aaron Rodgers ’ legendary career. While nothing is guaranteed yet, speculation continues to swirl around the Steelers possibly signing the four-time MVP. If that does materialize, Pittsburgh could end up doing what the Green Bay Packers never did during Rodgers’ tenure: use a first-round pick to draft a wide receiver tailored to his strengths.Throughout his Green Bay journey, Aaron Rodgers built a Hall of Fame résumé without ever having a first-round wideout to throw to. Yet, the lack of top-end investment in receivers didn't prevent him from excelling. Early on, however, the road wasn’t smooth. After sitting behind Brett Favre for three seasons, Rodgers’ first year as a starter in 2008 saw him post 28 touchdowns and 13 interceptions—a respectable start but hardly indicative of the future dominance to come.Everything began to change with the rise of Jordy Nelson . Drafted in the second round in 2008, Nelson didn’t break out until 2011. That year, he tallied 1,263 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns—ushering in a golden era of chemistry between the two. Over the next few seasons, Nelson became Rodgers’ go-to weapon, showcasing a blend of size, precision, and toughness that made him nearly unguardable.Now, as Pittsburgh eyes its future, a familiar profile has emerged—Tetairoa McMillan. The Arizona wide receiver is drawing striking comparisons to Nelson, not just in size but in play style and measurables. McMillan stands at 6’4’’ and 219 pounds with 10-inch hands—virtually a mirror image of Nelson. Their timed speeds are nearly identical too, with Nelson clocking a 4.51-second 40-yard dash and McMillan at 4.53.“He’s a big, fluid wide receiver with excellent hands,” is the typical scouting breakdown—and the similarities to Nelson don’t stop there. McMillan’s ability to run a complete route tree, maintain body control along the sidelines, and win contested catches make him an ideal match for Rodgers’ preferences.Rodgers’ history speaks volumes. After Nelson, it was Davante Adams (6'1'', 212 pounds) and Allen Lazard (6'4 5/8'', 227 pounds) who became his trusted weapons—not because they were the fastest, but because they brought physicality, reliability, and chemistry. None of them had elite speed, yet each thrived under Rodgers. That alone makes the idea of McMillan in Pittsburgh intriguing.The big question remains—will McMillan be available at pick No. 21? For most of the draft process, that seemed unlikely. However, recent comments by NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah have sparked hope. While speaking on the Up & Adams show with Kay Adams, Jeremiah noted that teams are not universally sold on McMillan, and even linked Pittsburgh as a potential destination.Helping this possibility is the emergence of other draft favorites like Emeka Egbuka and Matthew Golden , who may push McMillan down the board. There’s also the resurfaced video of McMillan saying, “I don’t like to watch film. I don’t need to watch it by myself,” which could cause some teams to hesitate. But the Steelers, known for taking risks on raw talent, might overlook such concerns in favor of offensive upside.Pairing Rodgers with a Nelson-like talent such as McMillan could instantly elevate Pittsburgh’s offense. With George Pickens’ future uncertain and whispers of a trade circulating, McMillan could become the new centerpiece in an offense designed to make one final championship push with Rodgers at the helm.In the end, this wouldn’t just be a smart football move—it would be poetic justice. The Steelers might finally give Aaron Rodgers the first-round receiving weapon that eluded him his entire career.Also Read: Could the Patriots’ future rest on Jalen Milroe, the dynamic Alabama QB hailed as ‘next Jalen Hurts’?","The Pittsburgh Steelers stand on the edge of a potentially transformative decision.

Internet swoons as Brittany Mahomes posts sweet moment of Bronze saying his real name at age two



Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are giving fans another heartwarming glimpse into their growing family, this time with a rare and adorable appearance by their 2-year-old son, Bronze. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his wife, Brittany, are never shy about sharing special moments with their children, but this recent video truly struck a chord with fans.On April 8, Brittany Mahomes took to Instagram Stories to post a touching clip of her and Bronze enjoying some outdoor time. In the video, Brittany gently asks her toddler, “What’s your name?” With a shy grin, he replies, “Bronzie.” When prompted about his real name, the little boy proudly responds, “Patrick Mahomes Three,” holding up three tiny fingers. A glowing Brittany smiles and responds with, “Nice job.”Though the couple often refers to their son by his nickname, Bronze, his full name—Patrick Lavon Mahomes III—is a meaningful tribute to his father. Patrick Mahomes has long envisioned passing down his name, once sharing, “I've thought about that since I was really like five, six years old.” The nickname “Bronze” not only creates a unique identity for their son but also keeps with a fun family tradition. Their two dogs are named Steel and Silver, and their daughters, Sterling Skye and Golden Raye, also have metallic-inspired names.The sweet exchange between Brittany and Bronze wasn’t just confined to her Instagram. Patrick also reshared the video, accompanied by three “A-OK” emojis, proudly acknowledging the moment. It’s clear that this family cherishes every milestone, no matter how small.During a January appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Brittany joked about using Bronze’s formal name, saying, “I have to say his real name or his dad will get mad,” further confirming just how personal the name is for Patrick. It’s evident the couple puts thought and meaning into every aspect of their children’s lives.The Mahomes family has had an eventful start to 2025, recently welcoming their third child, Golden Raye, just weeks before Patrick competed in his fifth Super Bowl. Despite the Chiefs’ tough loss to the Eagles, Patrick’s message to fans was one of humility and determination. “I let ya’ll down today… I’ll always continue to work and try and learn and be better for it.”Through all the highs and lows—on and off the field—Brittany and Patrick Mahomes remain grounded in family. Their latest video with Bronze not only showcases a touching parenting moment but also reminds fans of the values that truly matter to them: love, legacy, and connection.Also Read: Rookie QB Caleb Williams already feeling the pressure from Ben Johnson’s coaching style","Brittany and Patrick Mahomes' 2-year-old son, Bronze, says his real name.
