Poll Should schools conduct regular safety drills in light of threats like these? Yes, absolutely. No, it's unnecessary.





BENGALURU: Panic gripped around 40 schools across Bengaluru on Friday morning after they received threatening emails warning of bomb attacks.The threatening messages were sent by a miscreant using the email ID ‘roadkill333@atomicmail.io’, who also claimed he would end his life after the children died.Schools in Central, East, West, and South Bengaluru were among those targeted.According to police sources, a single email was sent to all the institutions around 7.24am, with the subject line reading: “Bombs inside the school.”The sender, who identified himself as ""Roadkill,"" claimed to have placed multiple explosives (Trinitrotoluene) inside classrooms. He alleged that the bombs were “skillfully hidden in black plastic bags.”""I will erase every last one of you from this world. Not a single soul will survive. I will gladly laugh when I watch the news, only to see the parents show up at the school and be greeted by the cold, dismembered bodies of their children,"" the email read.The message continued with the sender expressing suicidal intent and anger at psychiatrists, stating: ""You only care about medicating the helpless and clueless humans...I am living proof that they do not [help]. You all deserve this. You deserve to suffer just like me."" He also asked that the email be shared with the media.Upon receiving the alerts, schools quickly evacuated students and staff. Bomb detection and disposal squads (BDDS) along with local police rushed to each location and began checks as per standard safety protocols. No explosives were found at any of the schools as of Friday afternoon.While police suspect the threat to be a hoax, a senior officer stated that an official declaration would only be made after the completion of checks at all affected institutions. ""We are collecting formal complaints from the schools and will initiate necessary legal action. Parents need not panic,"" the officer added.The Principal of St Germain Academy confirmed to the media that police completed their inspection and found no threats. “Exams are being conducted as scheduled. There is nothing to worry about,” he said.","Schools in Central, East, West, and South Bengaluru were among those targeted.

Gisele Bündchen spoke openly about her early struggles and childhood insecurities

Success didn’t come from beauty alone — it came from drive, discipline, and determination

Before she was one of the world’s highest-paid and most recognizable supermodels, Gisele Bündchen faced a reality that didn’t align with glossy runways or magazine covers — she was bullied for her appearance. In a candid 2016 interview with The New York Times, Bündchen revealed that her career was not built on conventional beauty but on resilience, energy, and unshakable drive.Years before she ruled the fashion world, Bündchen was a tall, athletic girl from Brazil, often teased by classmates for being skinny, red-faced from volleyball, and having a “big nose.” The model recalled, “My career was never based on pretty. Even before I got into the business, I was used to being bullied because I was always tall and skinny and stuck out.” For Bündchen, bullying became a formative experience — one that shaped her character and drive more than any runway ever could.Her story is far from the fairy tale many imagine. Even after entering the modeling world, she was told her eyes were too small, her nose too big, and that she’d never land on a magazine cover. “But, you know what? The big nose is coming with a big personality,” she quipped. That personality and work ethic would eventually silence critics and turn her into an icon.Bündchen’s success wasn’t accidental. Leaving home at just 14, she was determined to make something of herself — a mindset she credits to her upbringing in a large family of six girls. “I’m a twin, I’m a Cancer, I’m always taking care of other people. I’ve always been the fixer in the family, the responsible one,” she shared. Her discipline was unmatched: “Never late for a job in my life. Really, ask anyone.”nullHer big break came when legendary fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier cast her for Harper’s Bazaar. Despite skepticism from others on set, Demarchelier remembered her spark clearly: “She was smart and outgoing, always happy... Immediately, right away, you could see that the girl was special.”Also Read: “Stereotypically selfish”: Tom Brady’s fans call out Gisele Bündchen’s ‘victim act’—did her Vanity Fair interview cross the line?

Who Is Eugenia Cooney?

Eugenia Cooney passed away?! ￼

Last livestream fuels concerns before silence

Fans TERRIFIED After YouTube Star Eugenia Cooney COLLAPSES on Livestream

There’s no official word from the YouTuber or her family yet

The internet can’t stop talking about Eugenia Cooney, but not for the usual reasons. A bizarre and chilling rumor claiming the longtime influencer had “passed away” exploded across social media this week, after a self-identified neighbor alleged they saw a body bag being taken from her home. With no official statement and barely any recent activity on her socials, the rumor mill spun out of control, and fast.The story began when a Facebook user posted that they saw an ambulance outside Cooney’s home “around 11 PM” on July 12. The neighbour added that a “body in a bag” was brought out.This post alone was enough to set Reddit threads and X (formerly Twitter) timelines ablaze, with many users questioning whether the news was true or just another disturbing rumor.Adding to the chaos, screenshots emerged of Meta AI apparently confirming her death, citing “acute multi-organ dysfunction” and mentioning she had been under “specialized care for longstanding health conditions.”The AI-generated post described Eugenia as someone who “remained a prominent figure” despite public concern over her health.While Meta AI's comment has since been removed or flagged for error, the combination of digital confusion and real-world witness claims sent social media into a spiral.Eugenia Cooney is an influencer, YouTuber, and gothic cosplayer. She currently has over 2 million subscribers and a deeply loyal, though often concerned, fanbase. But her internet fame has always been entangled with one thing: concern for her health.Some remembered the 2015 petition that tried to ban her from YouTube , alleging she promoted harmful beauty standards. Others recalled her Twitch ban in 2022 and TikTok restrictions after increasing backlash.In May 2025, Eugenia went live on her usual setup—bright lighting, Hello Kitty decor, and upbeat music. But midway through the stream, she appeared visibly unwell. At one point, she gagged and abruptly ended the broadcast, telling viewers she “wasn’t feeling great.”That was the last fans saw of her in real time.Since then, only two videos have been posted on her accounts. Many believe the clips were pre-recorded. The lack of updates, combined with growing AI misinformation and neighbor rumors, created the perfect storm for a viral hoax.At the time of writing, there has been no official confirmation from Eugenia Cooney's family, management, or platforms. Longtime friend and beauty influencer Jeffree Star commented vaguely that she was “clearly not okay,” but refrained from sharing more.That silence has only made fans more uneasy. Many followers have pointed out how Eugenia’s physical appearance and visible health issues have been an ongoing concern for years.","Eugenia Cooney is an influencer, YouTuber, and gothic cosplayer.

Stephen Curry’s mom, Sonya Curry, has shared a wonderful message for her 241 thousand fans on Instagram after visiting her mother in the hospital. Sonya’s message was filled with a heartfelt gesture to her mother as she shared the importance of family bonds, connectivity, and communication between the family members. In today’s landscape, Sonya’s message would certainly resonate with her fans.While visiting her mother, Candy Adams, in the hospital, Sonya Curry took a moment to reflect and share a heartfelt message with her fans. She encouraged people to be more intentional about showing love to those who matter most in their lives.“So, I’m here at the hospital visiting with my mom and I had a thought which can be dangerous sometimes. But anyway, what if we fiercely loved on someone that we love and they mean a lot to us, important in our lives, making them priority by being intentional by visiting them, connecting with them and just catching up,” Sonya said in a recent video that she posted on Instagram.Whether it’s sitting on a porch, going for a walk, or getting nails done together, Sonya emphasized the importance of spending time with loved ones and making those moments count.“And we all are guilty of this, we all have someone in our lives who we say, man, ‘I’ve been meaning to see, go see them and connect with them. And do it physically, go by, just sit on the porch, sit in the living room, go for a walk around the block, do some activity together, get your nails done. So many things you could do. But be intentional about it,” she added.Sonya Curry took a moment to reflect on the importance of being present with the people we care about. She shared a personal message about how easy it is to delay meaningful connections, only to find ourselves in moments of regret when it’s too late. Her thoughts centered around being intentional— choosing to connect while our loved ones are still able to share, laugh, talk, and experience life alongside us.“Be intentional about connecting with people while they can participate with you instead of, you know, sit in the hospital room and staring at someone and they can’t either talk back or participate with you. Um, we’re anticipating that might be the last time you see them,” Sonya shared.Sonya emphasized the value of prioritizing those relationships that often get pushed aside in the rush of daily life. Whether it’s a simple visit, a walk, or spending quiet time together, she encouraged making the effort before those chances are gone. With a mix of sincerity and humor, she reminded her friends to follow through on promises to visit, especially those who had been meaning to see her in Florida. Her message resonated as both a heartfelt challenge and a call to action to make time for what truly matters.Sonya also launched a challenge for her fans and everyone who is looking at her message.“So my challenge is to connect with that person and we all have someone who we’ve been meaning to connect with, uh, and do it over this next week. Make it simple but go out of your way to make them a priority,” Sonya said.“I look forward to hearing what you do and who do you do it with. And a selfish plug for all my friends who said y’ll were going to visit me in Florida and I ain’t seen you yet, make it happen. Love you, have a blessed day,” she added.Also Read: Ayesha Curry Sums Up Life with Stephen Curry in One Word After Touching Family Moment with Daughters The mother of NBA legend Steph Curry also captioned the post, “I challenge you to LOVE FIERCELY💕Reach out to someone you care about and carve out intentional time just for them. Share something you both enjoy. Whether it’s an activity, a deep conversation, or simply sitting in silence together. Be present. Let your love be seen, heard, and felt #FierceLove #LoveFiercely”Sonya’s message is certainly bold and deserves a wide attention. Sonya, however, did not give any update on her mother's health condition, and considering her reaction, it could be critical. Regardless, her message for family bold and love would certainly win hearts of many fans.","Stephen Curry’s mom, Sonya Curry, has shared a wonderful message for her 241 thousand fans on Instagram after visiting her mother in the hospital.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

BRUSSELS: In a small, refrigerated room at a Brussels university, parka-wearing scientists chop up Antarctic ice cores tens of thousands of years old in search of clues to our planet's changing climate.Trapped inside the cylindrical icicles are tiny air bubbles that can provide a snapshot of what the earth's atmosphere looked like back then.""We want to know a lot about the climates of the past because we can use it as an analogy for what can happen in the future,"" said Harry Zekollari, a glaciologist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).Zekollari was part of a team of four that headed to the white continent in November on a mission to find some of the world's oldest ice -- without breaking the bank.Ice dating back millions of years can be found deep inside Antarctica, close to the South Pole, buried under kilometres of fresher ice and snow.But that's hard to reach and expeditions to drill it out are expensive.A recent EU-funded mission that brought back some 1.2-million-year-old samples came with a total price tag of around 11 million euros (around $12.8 million).To cut costs, the team from VUB and the nearby Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) used satellite data and other clues to find areas where ancient ice might be more accessible.- Blue ice -Just like the water it is made of, ice flows towards the coast -- albeit slowly, explained Maaike Izeboud, a remote sensing specialist at VUB.And when the flow hits an obstacle, say a ridge or mountain, bottom layers can be pushed up closer to the surface.In a few rare spots, weather conditions like heavy winds prevent the formation of snow cover -- leaving thick layers of ice exposed.Named after their colouration, which contrasts with the whiteness of the rest of the continent, these account for only about one percent of Antarctica territory.""Blue ice areas are very special,"" said Izeboud.Her team zeroed in on a blue ice stretch lying about 2,300 meters (7,500 feet) above sea level, around 60 kilometres (37 miles) from Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Research Station.Some old meteorites had been previously found there -- a hint that the surrounding ice is also old, the researchers explained.A container camp was set up and after a few weeks of measurements, drilling, and frozen meals, in January the team came back with 15 ice cores totalling about 60 meters in length.These were then shipped from South Africa to Belgium, where they arrived in late June.Inside a stocky cement ULB building in the Belgian capital, they are now being cut into smaller pieces to then be shipped to specialised labs in France and China for dating.Zekollari said the team hopes some of the samples, which were taken at shallow depths of about 10 meters, will be confirmed to be about 100,000 years old.- Climate 'treasure hunt' -This would allow them to go back and dig a few hundred meters deeper in the same spot for the big prize.""It's like a treasure hunt,"" Zekollari, 36, said, comparing their work to drawing a map for ""Indiana Jones"".""We're trying to cross the good spot on the map... and in one and a half years, we'll go back and we'll drill there,"" he said.""We're dreaming a bit, but we hope to get maybe three, four, five-million-year-old ice.""Such ice could provide crucial input to climatologists studying the effects of global warming Climate projections and models are calibrated using existing data on past temperatures and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere -- but the puzzle has some missing pieces.By the end of the century temperatures could reach levels similar to those the planet last experienced between 2.6 and 3.3 million years ago, said Etienne Legrain, 29, a paleo-climatologist at ULB.But currently there is little data on what CO2 levels were back then -- a key metric to understand how much further warming we could expect.""We don't know the link between CO2 concentration and temperature in a climate warmer than that of today,"" Legrain said.His team hopes to find it trapped inside some very old ice.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.",The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province.

Some Ontario drivers are voicing growing frustration over the widespread use of speed cameras, as a new petition gains momentum in Brampton calling for their removal.With 185 automated speed enforcement (ASE) cameras set to be active across Brampton by the end of the summer, critics say the system is turning roads into zones of constant surveillance, reports Inside Halton.“In the midst of an affordability crisis, inflation, rising taxes and economic pressure, families cannot afford to have their hard-earned money siphoned through automated ticketing systems,” wrote Carolina Cutruzzola in a Change.org petition demanding the cameras be abolished. “These cameras disproportionately impact working class individuals, many of whom are just trying to commute safely, efficiently and peacefully. ”The petition, signed by more than 4,100 people as of July 14, accuses the authorities of removing the human element of policing and replacing it with what Cutruzzola called “cold, impersonal technology.” She argued that drivers are under pressure and said: “We are human. We are not perfect. We are not machines.”Ontario first authorised the use of ASE cameras in 2017 to improve road safety in school and community zones where speed limits are under 80 km/h.The province says the goal is to reduce collisions and protect vulnerable pedestrians, but the cameras are controlled entirely by municipalities.Speed camera enforcement has been controversial in cities across Ontario. In Toronto, a camera on Parkside Drive was cut down for the sixth time since November, even after another surveillance camera was installed to catch vandals. In Vaughan, the programme was paused after it issued over 32,000 tickets in just three weeks.The fines, especially in designated community safety zones, can be steep. A ticket for going 10 km/h over the limit in such areas is $68.25, but municipalities often do not disclose whether any grace is given before issuing tickets. “Speed limits are not guidelines — they are the law,” the City of Vaughan noted.Ticket recipients often receive notice weeks later by post, and fighting them in court is difficult. There is no interaction with police, and the photo evidence includes the vehicle, time, location and speed. However, the tickets do not affect driving records or insurance, unless the driver operates a commercial vehicle.While the province says the ASE framework is meant to promote safety, critics argue it’s creating anxiety and raising money off working-class commuters. Some municipalities, like York Region, have brought in over $11.5 million since launching their programmes, raising questions about the role of revenue in the use of speed cameras.","185 automated speed enforcement (ASE) cameras set to be active across Brampton by the end of the summer.

A Call for Global Adoption







In a groundbreaking move that could reshape the way the world evaluates creative and scientific output, His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation, has announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind global classification system. The initiative, called the, aims to clearly differentiate between human and machine contributions in the research, production, and publication of creative, academic, scientific, and intellectual content.As reported by the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Sheikh Hamdan emphasized the urgency of this step in light of the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI):“Distinguishing between human creativity and artificial intelligence has become a real challenge in light of today’s rapid technological advances. This calls for a new approach to recognise the growing role of intelligent machines. That’s why we launched the world’s first Human–Machine Collaboration Icons, a classification system that brings transparency to how research documents, publications, and content are created. ”This new system is not just theoretical, it is being implemented immediately across Dubai’s government. Sheikh Hamdan has directed all Dubai Government entities to adopt the classification in their research and knowledge-based projects.The HMC classification system, developed by the Dubai Future Foundation, offers a practical and visually accessible way for readers, researchers, and decision-makers to understand the extent of AI involvement in content creation. The classification introduces five core icons that indicate the level of collaboration between humans and intelligent machines:This approach is designed to inject clarity into a domain where AI use often goes undisclosed. In today’s digital landscape, where tools like generative AI, automation systems, and intelligent algorithms increasingly shape content, it’s often difficult for consumers or collaborators to understand how much of the work was created by a human or a machine.The termin this context covers a broad range of technologies: from AI and automation tools to robotics and algorithms, or any digital system that plays a role in the research, design, writing, analysis, or presentation of information.The HMC system goes beyond top-level labels by introducing nine functional icons that show where, in the content creation process, human–machine collaboration took place. These icons are especially relevant to common research workflows and publication tasks, helping identify exactly how machines were involved.As a foundation, the classification system reflects key stages that typically involve machine assistance in research and content production. These include:For instance, a research paper may be marked “Machine Assisted” with functional icons indicating AI helped in data analysis and visuals, but ideation and writing were entirely human-led. This enables a more nuanced and transparent evaluation, providing valuable insight not only into thebut theof content creation.Importantly, the system does not attempt to assign numeric percentages or weights to the machine's contribution, acknowledging that these judgments can often be subjective. Instead, it empowers creators to be honest and transparent about the involvement of machines, providing audiences with the information they need to evaluate authenticity and integrity.Sheikh Hamdan's announcement is more than a local policy, it’s a global invitation.“We invite researchers, writers, publishers, designers, and content creators around the world to adopt this new global classification system and use it responsibly and in ways that benefit people,” he stated.This marks more than just a response to rapid technological change, it’s a clear signal that Dubai wants to shape how the world works with AI, not just adapt to it. As intelligent machines become more deeply involved in how we create and communicate, the line between human input and machine output continue to blur. The HMC Icons are meant to bring that line back into focus, not to hold innovation back, but to make sure people know what they’re looking at, and can trust what they’re reading or watching.By launching this system, Dubai is taking a leadership role in shaping ethical AI use and setting new standards for content transparency. The classification model is built to be adaptable across multiple sectors, such as academia, design, video production, and software development, where AI is increasingly integrated into everyday workflows. At its core, the system promotes honest disclosure of machine involvement, encouraging creators and institutions to uphold integrity by clearly showing how content is produced.By normalizing transparency, it may also reshape how AI involvement is perceived, less as a hidden shortcut and more as a declared, deliberate part of the creative and research process.","Dubai launched a global system to label human vs. AI roles in content creation. The HMC Icons show how much humans or machines contributed, across writing, research, design, etc. The new system, developed by the Dubai Future Foundation, features five main icons and nine functional markers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122598068,imgsize-726274,width-400,resizemode-4/122598068.jpg"

Why Supercars? The Strategy Behind the Spectacle

Enforcement Efficiency: Dubai’s fast roads require police cars that can match or exceed the speed of offenders.





Public Engagement: Tourists frequently pose for photos with the cars, which strengthens the relationship between the force and the public.





Global Branding: The fleet projects Dubai’s image as a city of the future, rooted in innovation, luxury, and excellence.





Deterrence: The presence of high-performance vehicles serves as a visible deterrent to unlawful activity.





Sustainability: With growing EV integration, Dubai is aligning its law enforcement with green goals.





The Future of Policing?





In most parts of the world, police cars are designed for utility, not spectacle. In Dubai, however, they are a statement. Since 2013, the Dubai Police force has rewritten the playbook on law enforcement visibility by curating a vehicle fleet that looks more like an elite car show than a motor pool. With Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Rolls-Royces, and even a flying hoverbike, the Dubai Police fleet represents a unique blend of security, branding, and futuristic thinking.The transformation began in April 2013 with the induction of a Lamborghini Aventador into the police force. This was not simply about performance,it was about perception. The goal was clear: to elevate the image of Dubai as a global city of innovation, prosperity, and forward-thinking governance. Today, that vision is fully realized through a vehicle collection that symbolizes prestige, discipline, and a new form of civic engagement.Dubai’s roads are filled with high-performance vehicles owned by residents and tourists alike. To maintain authority and presence in such an environment, law enforcement vehicles had to match the city’s personality. These cars are strategically deployed in high-profile locations such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah Beach Residence, Dubai Mall, the Palm Jumeirah, and international expos,where they serve more as ambassadors than enforcers.While many of them are not used for daily patrols or high-speed pursuits, their presence deters crime and promotes a visible connection between police and the public.The Dubai Police force boasts a fleet of numerous supercars, but the exact number remains undisclosed. The collection is constantly evolving, and while not every vehicle is publicly confirmed, the lineup includes an unmatched variety of exotic, electric, luxury, and tactical models.The most expensive and fastest car in the Dubai Police fleet, the Bugatti Veyron is powered by an 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine that produces 1,001 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.5 seconds and reaches speeds beyond 400 km/h. Estimated at $1.6 million, it is a symbol of unmatched engineering and status.The flagship that started it all, the Aventador features a 6.5-litre V12 engine delivering 691 horsepower. With a top speed of 349 km/h and 0–100 km/h acceleration in 2.9 seconds, it turned the Dubai Police into a viral phenomenon practically overnight.Unveiled at the Arabian Travel Market in 2025, this luxury SUV comes equipped with a 6.75-litre twin-turbo V12, enhanced to 602 horsepower by Mansory. The bespoke widebody kit, carbon fibre bumpers, and elite presence make it a showpiece and mobile lounge for dignitary-related duties.Fitted specifically for Dubai Police, this €280,000 SUV includes sirens, emergency equipment, and a weapon-safe box. With 666 horsepower and a top speed over 300 km/h, it blends supercar speed with tactical utility.A recent addition representing the shift to electric mobility, the Cybertruck reportedly generates over 800 horsepower, accelerates to 100 km/h in under four seconds, and reaches estimated top speeds around 210 km/h. Its futuristic design aligns perfectly with Dubai’s branding strategy.Dubai’s electric ambitions continue with this sleek EV, introduced during the Arabian Travel Market 2023. It boasts 646 horsepower, a range of 472 km, and can fast charge from 5% to 80% in just 22.5 minutes. Used primarily in tourist zones, it also offers information and assistance to the public.This V8 grand tourer produces 542 horsepower and 770 Nm of torque, reaching 100 km/h in under 3.9 seconds. Designed for elite visibility and event-based security, it’s one of the most luxurious models in active rotation.Dubai Police’s first Chinese EV, this full-size luxury SUV features adaptive cruise control, a facial recognition interface, and acoustic alert systems. It marks the beginning of deeper tech integration into Dubai’s law enforcement strategy.Extremely rare and incredibly powerful, this 7.3-litre V12 supercar generates 750 horsepower and accelerates to 100 km/h in 3.7 seconds. Only 77 units were produced globally, making this one of the rarest police cars ever.Powered by a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8, this British supercar hits a top speed of 333 km/h and exemplifies mechanical precision. It’s used for ceremonial events and official showcases.With a 6.3-litre V12 engine producing 651 horsepower, the Ferrari FF was designed in part with input from Michael Schumacher . It combines grand touring luxury with elite performance and a nod to Italian engineering.Another Mansory-tuned SUV, this G63 boasts 710 horsepower and off-road capabilities, blending utility with visual impact. It's built for both terrain patrol and urban presence.This luxury performance coupe produces 467 horsepower from its 5.0-litre V8 and reaches 273 km/h in 4.4 seconds. Acquired for AED 250,000, it’s a sleek, fast, and budget-conscious performance car.Based on the Chevrolet Tahoe and developed by W Motors, the Ghiath features real-time facial recognition, an AI surveillance system, and integrated command tools. Ten are currently in service, with plans to scale up to 400 units.Each of these serves a distinct purpose, whether for high-speed response, desert patrol, ceremonial display, or community engagement.A revolutionary eVTOL vehicle capable of hovering 5 meters above the ground and flying at 96 km/h. With a flight time of 10–25 minutes (manual) and up to 40 minutes autonomously, this quadcopter bike is part of Dubai’s vision of airborne law enforcement.Introduced in 2014, these eco-friendly bikes are used in malls, events, and high-traffic zones. They combine agility with sustainability and are often favored for their silent, quick mobility.Dubai Police maintains a mounted unit for night patrols in communities such as Al Qusais, Mirdif, and Jumeirah. Operational since 1976, this unit plays ceremonial and community-building roles.Used primarily for aerial surveillance, crowd control, and emergency response. These aircraft are deployed during major events, cross-border monitoring, and disaster preparedness operations.The Dubai Police fleet is more than an indulgence in wealth,it’s a strategic tool of statecraft, law enforcement, and soft power.In a city synonymous with ambition, opulence, and vision, the Dubai Police fleet functions as a bridge between symbolism and service. From the Bugatti Veyron to the Scorpion hoverbike, every vehicle in this unmatched fleet is part of a grander strategy,to redefine public safety as not just a necessity, but an experience. Whether it’s winning the hearts of tourists or showcasing the technological might of the UAE, Dubai has ensured its police vehicles are as unforgettable as the city itself.","Dubai Police use supercars like Bugatti Veyron and Rolls-Royce Cullinan to enhance public safety and showcase city’s luxury.

"Tech CEO Andy Byron viral clip with colleague: Ex-employee makes big revelations, calls him 'toxic', 'aggressive'; says staff 'enjoyed seeing him exposed'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tech-ceo-andy-byron-viral-clip-with-colleague-ex-employee-makes-big-revelations-calls-him-toxic-aggressive-says-staff-enjoyed-seeing-him-exposed/articleshow/122726885.cms,"



A married tech CEO who went viral after being caught on the kiss cam with a colleague at a Coldplay concert is being slammed by a former employee as a “toxic” boss, with ex-staffers reportedly having second-hand embarrassment.Andy Byron is the chief executive of New York-based software firm Astronomer. He was seen in an awkward position with the company’s chief human resources officer Kristin Cabot during the band’s Boston show at Gillette Stadium.The pair was shown holding hands and wrapped in each other’s arms on the big screen before Cabot turned her back to the camera and Byron tried to duck out of view.The viral clip sparked online debate over workplace conduct and also started chatter among Byron’s former employees.A former employee who once reported directly to Byron told the New York Post that the incident was met with laughter and a sense of satisfaction among former staff.“The text groups and chains of former employees are like… everybody’s laughing their ass off and enjoying the hell out of what happened and him getting exposed,” the former colleague told The Post.The source added that Byron was seen as a harsh and aggressive manager.“In the workplace, Byron allegedly has a reputation as an aggressive, sales-obsessed executive who can be ‘toxic’,” the former employee said.Astronomer has not yet issued a public statement on the incident. Byron and Cabot have also not responded to media requests for comment.Astronomer, known for building cloud platforms to manage and monitor data pipelines, hired Cabot in November 2024. At the time, Byron had publicly praised her, saying, “Kristin’s exceptional leadership and deep expertise in talent management, employee engagement, and scaling people strategies will be critical as we continue our rapid trajectory.”“She is a proven leader at multiple growth-stage companies and her passion for fostering diverse, collaborative workplaces makes her a perfect fit for Astronomer,” he added in the company’s official press release. Cabot had previously worked at data analytics firm Neo4j.She had responded positively to her onboarding experience, saying she was “energized” by her conversations with Byron and the Astronomer leadership team.Now, the viral concert video has proven damaging not just for the CEO and the HR head, but also for the company’s public image. Social media users criticised Astronomer’s work culture, with many demanding disciplinary action and suggesting that the leadership was aware of the relationship.Adding to the speculation, another employee from Astronomer who attended the concert with the pair was also seen in the video, appearing shocked and smiling as Cabot covered her face and Byron retreated from the camera’s view.",Andy Byron is the chief executive of New York-based software firm Astronomer.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Microsoft has reportedly closed its Movies and TV store on both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs, effective today (July 18). According to a report, users can no longer purchase new movies or TV shows but they can access previously bought content for playback on their devices.The Verge reports that Microsoft confirmed that downloads will continue to be available on Windows, in up to HD resolution. However, users must continue to use the dedicated Movies & TV app on Windows or Xbox to play the content they own.Notably, the only exception for accessing content on other services is for purchases made in the US that are part of the Movies Anywhere platform. Microsoft is not offering refunds for past purchases.The company has also stated it will continue to provide support for any playback issues with previously purchased content.The latest move marks the end of Microsoft’s digital video retail effort that began with the Zune Video Marketplace in 2006. That service then evolved into Xbox Video in 2012, transforming into the Movies & TV app and store in 2015.The Verge claims that the closure of Microsoft’s movie and TV storefront wasn’t entirely unexpected by Xbox and Windows users, especially after the company shut down its Groove Music service in 2017.Meanwhile, YouTube has gained market share in terms of watch time of TV in the US. A recent Nielsen report claimed that YouTube and Netflix together captured 20% of all US television viewing time in May. However, the Google-owned service logged more market share – 12.5% – compared to Netflix's 7.5%. Their closest streaming rival, Disney, with its combined services Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+), accounted for 5% of TV time during the same period.","Microsoft has reportedly closed its Movies and TV store on both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs, effective today (July 18) Users can no longer purchase new movies or TV shows but they can access previously bought content for playback on their devices.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue.
