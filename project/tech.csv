In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New GST rates effective today: 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% Tax Brackets. The 40% tax is for goods that are either categorized as sin or luxury. Below is a full list of items that now attract 0, 5, 18% and 40%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124031450,imgsize-61380,width-400,resizemode-4/new-gst-rates-2025-full-list.jpg"

Supreme Court Says Flaws In Bihar SIR Can Nullify Exercise; Ruling To Extend Across The country

NEW DELHI: Election Commission now requires an applicant seeking fresh enrolment or inclusion/exclusion of a voter from the electoral roll via online mode to mandatorily verify his identity through OTP-based Aadhaar authentication.While online applications related to the electoral roll - through Form 6 (fresh enrolment), Form 7 (objection to inclusion/exclusion of voter in roll) and Form 8 (corrections) - would henceforth require'e-sign' based on Aadhaar authentication, those who do not have Aadhaar number can always fill out the physical forms and personally submit them to the electoral registration officer (ERO) or the booth level officer (BLO).The 'e-sign' requirement for online applications related to the voters' list, EC sources told TOI, was conceptualised in Aug and rolled out quietly in the second week of Sept. The reform, it was underlined, preceded Congress MP Rahul Gandhi's Sept 18 press conference during which he had alleged unauthorised attempts at deletion of over 6,000 voters in Aland assembly constituency of Karnataka in Dec 2022.The 'e-sign' initiative is meant to ensure that the applicant's name in the electoral photo identity card (EPIC) and phone number - as declared in the online Forms 6, 7 or 8 - matches with his/her details recorded in the Aadhaar system.Form 7 allows an elector to object against the proposed inclusion or exclusion of a voter in the electoral roll of a constituency in which he himself is also registered. Such an applicant must mention his name, EPIC number and mobile number of self 'or' relative (father/mother/husband/legal guardian) in the form. The e-sign option prompts the applicant to complete his OTP-based Aadhaar authentication before submitting the form.EC had, soon after Rahul's presser, clarified only 24 of the 6,018 applications for deletions in Aland were found genuine, while the remaining 5,994 were found incorrect, and rejected. An FIR was filed on Sept 6, 2023 by the Aland ERO in the case and all available details handed over to the investigation agency.","EC now requires an applicant seeking fresh enrolment or inclusion/exclusion of a voter from the electoral roll via online mode to mandatorily verify his identity through OTP-based Aadhaar authentication.

DHS video sparks backlash over unauthorized use of Pokémon branding



Pokémon Company remains cautious despite public pressure



The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently posted a Pokémon-themed video showing immigration raids, and the clip quickly drew widespread attention online. The one-minute montage spliced footage of ICE officers conducting arrests with scenes from the Pokémon TV show, set to the franchise’s iconic theme song, “Gotta Catch ’Em All. ” Fans immediately questioned the video’s appropriateness, while The Pokémon Company International clarified it had no involvement in its creation or distribution.The DHS video depicted federal agents in tactical gear carrying out searches and arrests, intercut with Ash Ketchum and Pokémon-themed graphics, ending with mock “cards” for the arrested individuals. The accompanying caption read, “Gotta Catch ’Em All,” referencing the popular slogan of the anime series.A spokesperson for The Pokémon Company told multiple outlets, including Daily Beast, “We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand. Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”Social media users quickly criticized the DHS video for dehumanizing immigrants and juxtaposing a children’s franchise with real-life law enforcement operations.Many tagged The Pokémon Company and Nintendo, urging them to pursue legal action. The video also included a clip from a raid overseen by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, which reportedly involved the mistaken detention of U.S. citizens.While fans demanded a strong response, Pokémon has remained measured. Don McGowan, the company’s former chief legal officer, told IGN that pursuing litigation was unlikely due to concerns over publicity and potential political ramifications. “They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand,” McGowan said. He added that several executives in the U.S. hold green cards, which could complicate any direct legal confrontation.The controversy highlights a growing tension over government use of copyrighted material in politically charged campaigns. Pokémon Company International, jointly owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures Inc., emphasized it continues to protect its intellectual property worldwide, particularly against uses that could link the brand to controversial or political messaging. As of now, the DHS video remains online, and neither ICE nor the department has publicly addressed the company’s statement.Also Read: How to Get Shiny Miraidon and Koraidon in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: Shiny Odds, Appearance and Availability, Best Tips and More","The Department of Homeland Security recently posted a Pokémon-themed video showing immigration raids.

Poll Which lifestyle change do you find most important for better lung health? Regular exercise & breathing exercises Healthy diet & avoiding pollution

Early warning signs you shouldn’t ignore



Persistent cough or wheezing

Shortness of breath with mild exertion

Chest tightness or unexplained fatigue

Recurrent respiratory infections

Chest pain (especially in smokers)

Subtle signs in children, like tiredness or slower activity levels

COVID-19’s long-term impact on lungs



Lifestyle and exercises for stronger lungs



Yoga & breathing exercises: Bhramari, Bhastrika, Anulom Vilom, Kapalbhati, Ujjayi, deep belly breathing, and pursed-lip breathing can strengthen lungs and ease breathlessness.

Diet: Focus on antioxidant-rich foods like broccoli, spinach, beetroot, carrots, oranges, berries, guava, and healthy spices like turmeric, garlic, cumin, and cinnamon.

Vaccinations: Annual flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines for those at risk.

Environment: Reduce exposure to air pollution, both indoors and outdoors.

Engage in aerobic exercises like brisk walking or swimming

Avoid smoking

Maintain a healthy weight and stay hydrated

Include breathing exercises like pranayama to gradually build lung capacity

Protecting children’s lungs







Your lungs work hard every single day, yet most of us only notice them when something goes wrong. This World Lung Day, it’s the perfect time to pause and focus on lung health, early warning signs of lung disease, and ways to protect your respiratory system, especially with air pollution on the rise and lingering COVID-19 effects still affecting many.We spoke with Dr. Vivek Nangia, Vice Chairman & Head of Pulmonology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, and Dr. Shiba Kalyan Biswal, Clinical Director of Pulmonology at Marengo Asia Hospitals, Gurugram, to break down the most pressing lung health issues today and how you can take charge.Both experts note that lung diseases are on the rise, affecting not just older adults but increasingly young adults and even children.Dr. Nangia explains, “The most common lung diseases we see are bronchial asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung diseases, lung cancer, and respiratory infections like tuberculosis, pneumonia, and influenza. These are increasing due to rising air pollution, personal smoking habits, and post-COVID complications. Early signs like cough, breathlessness, chest tightness, and low-grade fever are often missed.Dr. Biswal adds, “We are also seeing a rise in lung cancer, asthma, and COPD in younger patients. Factors like indoor pollutants, sedentary lifestyle, and worsening air quality are contributing. Even children now present with respiratory issues that were once mostly seen in older adults.”Legitimate red flags for lung disease often get brushed off as a cold or pollution-related cough. Here’s what to watch for:Dr. Biswal warns, “Ignoring these symptoms delays diagnosis and allows the disease to progress, making treatment harder and more complex.”Even years after recovery, COVID-19 continues to affect lung health. Dr. Biswal notes, “Many patients experience chronic breathlessness, scarring of lung tissue, or pulmonary fibrosis. These individuals benefit from long-term follow-up and lung rehabilitation to manage persistent symptoms.”The good news? You can actively improve lung capacity and respiratory health.Dr. Nangia recommends:Dr. Biswal adds:Starting lung-friendly habits early can make a huge difference.Dr Vivek Nangia advises, so for the parents, the simple advice that I want to give is to prevent the damage being done to our children's lungs, we should quit smoking, ensure that nobody's involved in vaping as it also damages the lungs majorly. Children should be regularly exercising outdoors, but at the same time, we should ensure that the outdoor air quality is good.If not good, then they should be doing it indoors only. Give the children some antioxidant rich diets, as I just said, and avoid air pollution as much as possible.Dr. Shiba Kalyan Biswal says for children, it is important to ensure that their surroundings are smoke free and exposure to air pollution is reduced, they also should be encouraged to be physically active outdoors, and stay up to date on their vaccinations. Building these habits at a young age is a great way to improve their lungs and lower their chances of developing chronic lung disease as adults.This World Lung Day 2025, take a moment to listen to your lungs. Persistent cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue isn’t just “part of getting older” ; it could be a warning sign of COPD, asthma, or even heart-related lung complications. Early detection, lifestyle changes, and proper medical care can make a world of difference for both adults and children.","This World Lung Day, it’s the perfect time to pause and focus on lung health, especially with air pollution on the rise and lingering COVID-19 effects still affecting many.

Ethical transparency: Be clear about which Gemini tools you used and how. If you use other tools or external footage, cite or document them. In some sources they say you may be asked to supply open files.



Theme execution over superficial references: It’s not enough to attach a theme name. Judges will look for depth — does your film really “rewrite tomorrow” with new ideas, or does it just slap on futuristic visuals? Does “The Secret Life Of” go deeper than just showing something hidden does it evoke empathy, surprise, insight?



Language / subtitles: English subtitles are required even if your dialogue is in another language. Poor subtitle translation or missing subtitles can hurt.



One entry per individual: While some sources say one entry per individual, others allow multiple entries (but maybe in different genres?). You’ll need to double-check this in the full criteria.



Public vote matters: Being shortlisted means you’ll go through public voting. So a film that appeals to audiences (not just art/AI enthusiasts) may have an edge. Think about clarity, emotional hook, shareability.

The cycle of day and night governs life on Earth, but in some regions, a remarkable phenomenon occurs where the sun never sets for weeks or even months at a time. Known as the midnight sun, this happens in latitudes above the Arctic Circle (66.56°N) and below the Antarctic Circle (66.56°S) during their respective summer seasons. During this extraordinary period, the sun remains visible even at midnight, creating endless daylight and a dreamlike atmosphere. While constant sunlight can disrupt sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, and overall biological balance, it also encourages outdoor activities, cultural festivals, social gatherings, and unique adventures. Residents and travellers alike experience a surreal, brightly sunlit environment that transforms daily life, boosts tourism, and expands recreational opportunities in fascinating ways.Norway, renowned for its dramatic fjords and Viking heritage, is a top destination to witness the midnight sun. At the North Cape, the sun remains visible for almost two months in summer. The long daylight hours allow travellers to engage in outdoor adventures like midnight golfing, hiking, and photography. Norwegian culture combines modern social systems with historic pride, and locals make the most of these endless days for festivals, barbecues, and communal activities.The midnight sun offers both an immersive natural experience and an insight into Norway’s rich cultural landscape.Alaska, often called America’s Last Frontier, covers over 663,000 square miles and is famous for its Aurora Borealis and rugged wilderness. In summer, regions such as Anchorage and northern Alaska experience prolonged daylight, allowing activities typically reserved for the day to continue late into the night. Residents often adjust sleep schedules to accommodate the extra sunlight, while visitors enjoy hiking, kayaking, and wildlife watching at unconventional hours. The midnight sun marks a transition from harsh winters to vibrant summer life, highlighting Alaska’s awe-inspiring natural beauty.Located above the Arctic Circle, Norilsk is the northernmost city of significant population, with around 180,000 residents. This mining town, rich in nickel and coal deposits, experiences the midnight sun for months. Though access is restricted for non-Russian citizens, the city offers a glimpse into human resilience in extreme conditions. Brutalist architecture dominates the landscape, prioritising functionality over aesthetics. Despite the harsh environment, the region benefits from prolonged daylight, aiding productivity and mental well-being during the sunlit summer months.Finland, a land of lakes, forests, and rich culture, enjoys months of continuous daylight in the far north. The midnight sun encourages outdoor activities, creativity, and social gatherings. Finnish culture, including its famous sauna traditions, thrives under the summer sun, while the abundance of light has influenced cuisine and lifestyle. Historically, Finland has been settled for over 13,000 years, and its northerly residents are adept at making the most of the long days, blending productivity with cultural and recreational pursuits.Northern Sweden, part of the Land of the Midnight Sun, experiences nearly continuous daylight in summer. This country is celebrated for its Renaissance architecture, expansive lakes, and peaceful way of life. Locals use the extra light to engage in outdoor sports, festivals, and cultural events. The extended sunlight has social and psychological benefits, encouraging a sense of community and active living. With only 13% of the population living in the frozen north, visitors can explore serene landscapes under the extraordinary summer sunlight.Iceland, situated just south of the Arctic Circle, experiences the midnight sun predominantly in June. Known for volcanoes, geysers, waterfalls, and glaciers, Iceland’s natural beauty is amplified by continuous daylight. Seljalandsfoss waterfall, photographed at 1 am, is a prime example of how the sun transforms familiar landscapes into magical scenes. Icelanders celebrate this phenomenon with outdoor festivals, midnight swims, and cultural events, embracing the unique energy and vibrancy it brings to daily life.Greenland, an island mostly covered by ice, enjoys continuous summer sunlight along its coastal regions. Nuuk, the capital, and surrounding towns celebrate the midnight sun with outdoor activities, fishing, and skiing. Despite extreme environmental conditions, locals adapt their routines to make the most of extended daylight. Historically, settlers named it “Greenland” to encourage immigration, yet today, the sunlit summer months offer relaxation, recreation, and a rare opportunity to witness one of Earth’s most extreme natural phenomena.In Canada’s Nunavut, Yukon, and Northwest Territories, the summer sun barely sets. Indigenous Inuit communities have lived with these extreme day-night cycles for centuries, developing lifestyles and traditions attuned to prolonged daylight. Visitors experience almost 24 hours of sunlight, perfect for hiking, wildlife watching, and cultural exploration. The midnight sun not only illuminates Canada’s rugged Arctic landscapes but also provides insight into indigenous adaptations and sustainable living in extreme northern conditions.Although mostly uninhabited, Antarctica experiences the midnight sun during its summer months (November to January). Research stations, seals, penguins, and other wildlife endure continuous daylight. Scientists take advantage of prolonged sun exposure to conduct fieldwork, while the landscape showcases towering ice shelves, glaciers, and pristine expanses. Unlike the northern hemisphere, the southern polar day occurs during the northern winter, offering a fascinating contrast in Earth’s seasonal cycles.","In some regions, the sun never sets for weeks or even months at a time.

New UAE school rules 2025: What parents must know about the ban on online food deliveries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-uae-school-rules-2025-what-parents-must-know-about-the-ban-on-online-food-deliveries/articleshow/124063276.cms,"Schools across the UAE have introduced a new rule: no more online food deliveries for students during school hours. Food apps like Talabat, Noon and Deliveroo can no longer drop meals at school gates, with education authorities pushing the change to improve child nutrition and safety.





UAE schools ban online food deliveries: New rules, dates and who is affected



Why UAE schools stopped food delivery apps: Health, safety and academic reasons



Nutrition and health: Most app-ordered meals are fast food, high in fat, sugar and salt, and not aligned with UAE health standards. Limiting deliveries helps promote balanced eating habits.

Food safety: Unlike school canteens, delivery food doesn’t undergo municipal or health inspections. This raises risks of poor handling, contamination, or undeclared allergens.

Student focus: Ordering and receiving food during school hours disrupts lessons. Authorities highlight that well-planned meals improve focus, energy and classroom performance.

Security and safeguarding: Limiting who can access school premises reduces unnecessary outside interaction, ensuring a safer environment for children.

How UAE schools will enforce the online food delivery ban and what parents should do



No app deliveries accepted: Schools will no longer accept food from delivery drivers, even if parents place an order.

Parent handover only: If a child forgets their lunch, parents can bring food to the school reception. In some schools, parents must also sign an undertaking form.

Canteens as the primary source: Approved canteens that meet Dubai Municipality, ADEK and Ministry of Health guidelines will provide meals, ensuring no student is left without food.

Special dietary needs: Parents of children with allergies or medical conditions are encouraged to coordinate directly with the school to make arrangements.

Healthy lunchbox ideas and parent tips after UAE school delivery ban



Plan the night before: Pack lunches in the evening to save morning stress.

Aim for balance: Include protein (eggs, chicken, hummus), whole-grain carbs (brown bread, wraps, rice), fruits, and vegetables.

Hydrate smartly: Send a reusable water bottle instead of sugary drinks.

Label containers: Add your child’s name and class to avoid mix-ups.

Involve children: Let them choose snacks or help pack to reduce fussiness.

Check with canteens: Schools are open to providing alternatives if students have dietary restrictions.

Chicken and avocado wrap + carrot sticks + apple slices

Hummus with whole-grain pita + cucumber and tomato salad + orange

Yogurt with granola + boiled egg + berries

What’s next: Compliance, canteens and parent concerns







Schools across the UAE have moved to stop online food deliveries to students during school hours, citing child safety and a push to promote healthier eating habits. Abu Dhabi’s Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) led the change ahead of the new school year, and several major school groups in Dubai have issued circulars telling parents that delivery apps such as Talabat and Noon are not allowed.Abu Dhabi’s education authority introduced updated nutrition rules that explicitly prohibit external food deliveries to schools during operating hours, with the policy taking effect from the start of the academic year on 25 August 2025. The directive forms part of broader measures to tighten school nutrition policies across the emirate.In Dubai and other Emirates, leading school operators (including GEMS and several private schools) have circulated similar internal notices: online delivery services are strictly not allowed, and some schools require parents who bring food to do so in person at reception and sign an undertaking form. Examples named in reporting include Talabat and Noon among the banned delivery options.Authorities cite several key reasons for banning deliveries:The new rules are being enforced through several measures:For parents, the shift means planning ahead and avoiding reliance on quick app orders.To adapt to the new policy, parents can focus on simple, balanced and easy-to-prepare meals. Practical tips include:Example lunchbox combos:The ban is expected to bring smoother meal management in schools, but it also comes with questions from parents. Some worry about picky eaters, time pressures at home, or affordability of canteen food. Schools and education authorities are assuring parents that canteens will continue to improve menus to make meals healthier and more appealing, No child will go hungry; schools will provide alternatives if lunches are forgotten, Feedback channels remain open so parents can raise concerns about menu choices or dietary needs. Ultimately, the initiative is less about limiting choice and more about building healthier habits, safer campuses, and stronger focus in classrooms.","Schools across the UAE have introduced a new rule: no more online food deliveries for students during school hours.

Absher: Driving digital transformation in Saudi Arabia







In a significant step towards simplifying firearms regulation and advancing digital governance, Saudi Arabia has introduced an online service enabling the transfer of air rifle ownership through the Absher platform. The service removes the need for in-person visits and offers a faster, more secure process for citizens and residents alike.Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Arms and Explosives, in coordination with Absher, has rolled out a digital service that allows individuals to transfer ownership of air rifles remotely. This eliminates the traditional requirement of visiting weapons shops or branches of the General Directorate, aligning with national efforts to digitize government services and reduce bureaucratic hurdles.The new digital mechanism offers a smooth, reliable way to manage air rifle ownership, entirely online. All data entered during the transfer process is automatically integrated into the official records of the relevant authorities, ensuring that each transaction is accurately recorded and legally traceable.Authorities emphasized that this step is not only about convenience but also about enforcing better oversight.The ownership transfer must comply with all regulations set by the General Directorate of Arms and Explosives, making sure the transaction is secure, transparent, and in accordance with national safety protocols.The entire process is designed to be quick, structured, and user-friendly. Here's how users can initiate and complete the air rifle ownership transfer via the Absher platform:Once the steps are followed, the system ensures all the data is captured and sent through a unified platform. This integration supports enhanced transparency and strengthens the accuracy of official weapon registration databases.The introduction of the air rifle ownership transfer service is the latest milestone in Absher’s role as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s digital transformation journey. Operated by the Ministry of Interior, Absher has grown into a leading e-government platform in the region, offering more than 350 electronic services that span across public security, passports, traffic, civil affairs, and weapons management.Since its launch in 2010, Absher has played a key role in modernizing government services by enabling individuals, whether citizens, residents, or visitors, to complete official transactions online, without needing to visit government offices or endure long wait times. The platform reflects the Kingdom’s broader commitment to digital innovation under Saudi Vision 2030.","Saudi Arabia’s General Directorate of Arms and Explosives has rolled out a digital service that allows individuals to transfer ownership of air rifles remotely.

Why a UAE Licence matters









Getting a driving licence in the UAE is now easier and more accessible than ever, thanks to recent updates that allow 17-year-olds to apply for permits. Whether you’re planning to ride a motorcycle, drive a car, operate a heavy vehicle, or even become a bus driver, the process is clearly laid out, from eligibility and documents to theory lessons, practical training, tests, and costs. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide to everything you need to know about obtaining your driving licence in the UAE.The UAE issues licences based on vehicle type, with specific age thresholds for each category:Until 2025, applicants could only begin lessons at 17.5 years and had to wait until turning 18 to receive their licence. A new federal decree law passed in October 2024 lowered the minimum age to 17, making the UAE the first GCC country to introduce this change.This update aims to create a new generation of safe, responsible drivers by instilling road safety habits earlier and offering young residents greater independence and mobility.Anyone who is a UAE citizen or resident, of the legal minimum age, and medically fit can apply. Here’s what you’ll need to get started:Here’s how the process unfolds in most Emirates (small variations may apply):Depending on your emirate, you must register with an approved driving school.The total cost of obtaining a UAE driving licence generally falls between AED 4,500 and AED 7,000 (approximately $1,226–1,907), depending on the emirate and the driving school you choose. This amount typically covers theory and practical training fees, the mandatory eye test, as well as all test and licence issuance charges. Once you’ve applied, you can easily check the status of your licence online, Dubai residents can do so via the RTA Dubai website, while applicants in other emirates can use the Ministry of Interior, Abu Dhabi Police, or TAMM platforms.Even with Dubai’s robust public transport network, many residents rely on personal cars for daily commutes. A UAE licence is also essential for renting a car, handy for those who don’t own one.The streamlined process, early eligibility, and rigorous testing ensure that drivers are well-prepared for the road — helping maintain safety standards across the country.","Driving without a licence in the UAE attracts heavy fines, so complete the process fully before getting behind the wheel.

Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has partnered with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to establish the Middle East’s first joint AI research facility. This strategic collaboration marks a significant milestone in the UAE’s growing efforts to become a global force in artificial intelligence and robotics innovation.The newly launched joint research lab, officially called the TII–Nvidia AI Technology Centre (NVAITC), is located in Abu Dhabi and represents the first of its kind in the Middle East. This collaboration brings together TII’s multidisciplinary research expertise in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous systems, and high-performance computing, with Nvidia’s advanced AI models and accelerated computing platforms.According to TII CEO Dr. Najwa Aaraj, the lab will focus on the development of next-generation AI models, humanoid technologies, robotics platforms, and intelligent systems capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.The partnership is designed to integrate advanced robotic platforms with cutting-edge AI tools, driving progress in areas such as:This lab also marks a pivotal shift in the region’s AI landscape as it’s the first time Nvidia’s NVAITC network is expanding into robotics in the Middle East.Carlo Ruiz, Nvidia's VP of Enterprise Solutions and Operations for EMEA, highlighted that the initiative aims to accelerate real-world breakthroughs in intelligent systems.A major highlight of the collaboration is the use of Nvidia’s Thor chip, a powerful edge GPU designed specifically for advanced robotic systems development. This chip, which TII will newly incorporate into its projects, is expected to play a crucial role in accelerating robotic innovation.TII is currently conducting R&D on a diverse portfolio of robotic systems, including:By leveraging the Thor chip and Nvidia’s computing infrastructure, TII aims to advance both the hardware and AI software integration of its robotic systems, with a focus on enabling these machines to reason, adapt, and act autonomously in real-time.Additionally, TII has already been using Nvidia’s chips to train its proprietary Falcon large language model (LLM) family, which is part of the UAE’s broader efforts to build national AI capabilities.This lab launch fits into the UAE’s long-term vision to become a global hub for artificial intelligence and advanced technologies. The country’s AI strategy is structured around several national frameworks:Earlier in 2025, the UAE and U.S. governments signed the AI Acceleration Partnership, reinforcing cooperation on critical technologies and announcing a joint initiative for a 5-gigawatt UAE–US AI Campus.This broader geopolitical backdrop also included a multi-billion-dollar agreement — signed during former U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the Gulf in May — to build one of the world’s largest data centre hubs in Abu Dhabi, powered by U.S. technologies and advanced Nvidia chips. However, the finalisation of this deal has faced delays, reportedly due to security concerns related to the UAE’s ties with China.Discussions to establish the joint lab began approximately a year ago. Now operational, the facility will be staffed by a dedicated team comprising experts from both TII and Nvidia. Additional hiring is underway to expand the project-specific workforce and support the lab's ongoing research objectives.The lab will serve as a central node in Nvidia’s global NVAITC network, and a regional hub for applied research, particularly in real-world AI and robotics deployments. It aims to not only support innovation but also contribute directly to the development of intelligent machines and systems with high levels of autonomy and functional complexity.","Abu Dhabi's Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has partnered with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to establish the Middle East’s first joint AI research facility.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

How LinkedIn is planning to train AI models with user data



“On November 3, 2025, we’ll start to use some data from members in these regions to train content-generating AI models that enhance your experience and better connect our members to opportunities.

This may include data like details from your profile, and public content you post on LinkedIn; it does not include your private messages. We rely on legitimate interest to process your data for this purpose. You can opt out anytime in your settings if you’d prefer not to have your data used in this way.

”

“In our updated User Agreement, we’ve made some changes to make it more readable, and to make some defined terms such as ‘Affiliate’ more prominent. We also added details about when we won’t be able to provide you the typical prior notice about changes to these terms (i.e., because laws change or a new product is launched). We’ve also added more information about when we will use secondary payment methods you may have provided to us, clarified that deep fakes and other wrongful impersonations violate our Terms, and provided more information about how you can appeal LinkedIn decisions that impact your use of our Services,”

What Rafael Nadal said about the AI investment scam



“Hello everyone,

I want to share this message of caution—something unusual for my social media, but necessary. In recent days, together with my team, we have detected fake videos circulating on some platforms. These were generated with artificial intelligence, showing a figure that imitates my image and my voice. In those videos, I am falsely attributed with investment advice or proposals that in no case come from me.

This is misleading advertising, completely unrelated to me. I ask you to be cautious: I have neither made nor endorsed such messages.

Artificial intelligence is a tool with enormous potential, capable of bringing extraordinary progress in education, medicine, sports, and communication. However, it can also be misused, creating false content that generates confusion and may deceive many people.

As a society, we face the challenge of learning to distinguish between what is real and what is manipulated, and of promoting an ethical and responsible use of technology. Innovation is always positive when it serves people, but we must remain aware of its risks and act with critical thinking.

Thank you all for your attention and for your continued support.”
