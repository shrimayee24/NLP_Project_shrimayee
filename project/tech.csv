The trials demonstrated the missile’s capability against ship targets while launched from an naval helicopter.“The missile uses an in- digenous imaging infra-red seeker for terminal guidance. The mission also has demonstrated the high bandwidth two-way datalink system, which is used to transmit the seeker live images back to the pilot for in-flight retargeting,” the defence ministry said.The missile was launched in ‘Bearing-only Lock-on’ after launch mode with several targets in close vicinity for selecting one among them.The trials have proven the missile’s ‘Man-in-Loop’ feature and scored a direct hit on a small ship target in sea-skimming mode at its maximum range, according to a statement released by the ministry.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO, Indian Navy and the industries for the successful flight tests carried out from Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur on Tuesday.

Silkyara tunnel heroes say Telangana battle tougher: 'Men trapped inside are silent',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silkyara-tunnel-heroes-say-telangana-battle-tougher-men-trapped-inside-are-silent/articleshow/118587404.cms,"Poll What Is The Best Way To Prevent Tunnel Disasters?

‘In Silkyara we could hear them, here it’s just silence’

Rat-hole mining: The ‘banned-practise’ that helped in evacuation of 41 workers from Silkyara tunnel

DEHRADUN: The tunnel has collapsed. Water and silt flood the narrow passage.Deep underground, there are eight men - trapped, unheard, unseen. At the mouth of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana, hundreds of rescuers battle against time, fighting to bring them back.Also read: 48hr deadline set to trace missing SLBC workers in collapsed tunnel Among them are three men who have been there before - and done that. Though in a different catastrophe, high up in the hills of Uttarakhand.Over a year ago, they had stood at the opening of another collapsed tunnel, overseeing another desperate mission. Then, too, hope hung by a thread. A diary entry would perhaps read: Silkyara, Uttarkashi. 41 men, 17 days.In the swirling dust and tension, the men who once defied the odds in Uttarakhand are fighting to do it again in Telangana even as they admit the battle this time is harder.A senior supervisor from the Silkyara tunnel project, Shashi Bhushan Chauhan , now standing at the SLBC collapse site, told TOI on Wednesday: ""Life has come full circle for us."" The words hang heavy in the damp air, thick with the smell of wet earth and diesel fumes. His voice is hoarse with exhaustion. It was in Nov 2023 that Chauhan first became a footnote in history, working beside an auger machine in the race to free the workers trapped inside Silkyara's blocked tunnel.Also read: Water, slush and debris make the job tougher for rescuers This time, the crisis is different. The SLBC tunnel is narrower - just 33 feet wide compared to Silkyara's 45 feet. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) is stuck. Water and sludge keep pushing in. Communication lines? Non-existent. The men trapped in are silent. And silence is the worst kind of omen in a rescue mission. But Chauhan and his team - a mechanic and an industrial fabricator from the Navayuga Group - do not deal in omens. They deal in steel, sweat, and a deep, unspoken understanding of what it means to pull men from the earth before it swallows them.""The teamwork feels the same as it did in Silkyara - everyone pushing forward, driven by a single mission,"" Chauhan said. ""But there's one crucial difference. In Silkyara, we could hear them. We knew they were there, that they were holding on. Here, there's only silence. No voices, no signals, nothing. That uncertainty makes this even harder. We don't know their condition, and that makes every second feel heavier.""Another rescuer explains why this operation is even more challenging. ""The auger machine we used in Silkyara? That's not an option here. There's too much water, too much silt. The ground is shifting, unpredictable. We dewater, and more water rushes in. We clear the silt, and fresh sludge takes its place. Every step forward feels like one step back.""Hope, however, comes in the form of men who are built for the impossible. A six-member crew of ' rat-hole miners ', the underground warriors who crawled through Silkyara's debris to bring the last workers to safety, are standing by, ready to descend into the unknown again.""Our team arrived on Sunday. We're waiting,"" says Wakeel Hasan, their leader. ""When the moment comes, we go in."" No bravado, no unnecessary words.Just the quiet, unwavering certainty of men who have walked into darkness before and come out carrying lives.","Eight men trapped in collapsed tunnel in Telangana, India.

Is Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry’s 3-Point Record the Most Unbreakable Stat in NBA History?

In the realm of NBA three-point shooting, there's Stephen Curry , and then there's everyone else. It's like comparing a supernova to a sparkler. While Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson are certified sharpshooters, Curry's recent exploits are less a demonstration of skill and more a display of basketball sorcery. Take the Golden State Warriors ' recent East Coast swing opener against the Orlando Magic. Even when the Dubs faced a daunting early deficit, Curry, simply rewrote the script.He started slow, almost toying with the Magic, before unleashing a second-quarter inferno. It was almost four minutes into the first quarter before the two-time MVP made his first shot. He scored the opening points of the game for the Warriors after draining a 28-footer. Orlando surged to a 34-23 lead as Curry closed the quarter with five points and two assists. Steph Curry scored 16 points in the second quarter, including the final three-pointer, a 49-footer, which reduced the Magic's lead to 66-52.When you see ""Most games with 9+ 3-pointers made in NBA history,"" it reads:45 — Steph Curry14 — Damian Lillard12 — Klay ThompsonYou don't just see a number, you witness a chasm. A canyon. A continental divide.Lillard and Thompson, two titans of the long ball, are relegated to the 'also-rans' section of the Curry story. It's not a slight on their abilities, but a testament to Curry's otherworldly consistency. They're like elite chefs forced to watch a culinary demigod effortlessly whip up a five-star meal while blindfolded.

Why Indianapolis hosts the NFL Combine every year: History and reasons behind Lucas Oil Stadium’s hosting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-indianapolis-hosts-the-nfl-combine-every-year-history-and-reasons-behind-lucas-oil-stadiums-hosting/articleshow/118615806.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Indianapolis and the NFL Combine: Why Lucas Oil Stadium Is Always the Chosen Venue



The Future of the NFL Combine in Indianapolis



For nearly four decades, the NFL Combine has transformed Indianapolis into the ultimate stage for college football’s elite to show their talents. While participants change annually, the Combine's home has consistently been the iconic Lucas Oil Stadium . Since 1987, Indianapolis has hosted this high-stakes event, drawing NFL scouts, coaches, and general managers eager to evaluate the next generation of football talent. But what makes Indianapolis so special that it continues to be the chosen venue?The decision to permanently move the NFL Combine to Indianapolis in 1987 was driven by its strategic location. Centrally positioned in the United States, the city offers easy accessibility for teams and players traveling from all corners of the country. Before settling in Indianapolis, the event was held in Dallas, followed by a rotation between warm-weather cities like Tampa, New Orleans, and Phoenix. However, the logistical challenges posed by those locations made it difficult for all teams to attend. Indianapolis, on the other hand, proved to be the most practical and inclusive option.A key factor that contributed to this decision was the presence of dome stadiums in Indianapolis. Since the Indianapolis Colts relocated from Baltimore in 1984, they have played in enclosed stadiums, starting with the Hoosier Dome and later moving to the state-of-the-art Lucas Oil Stadium in 2007. The stadium's retractable roof and climate-controlled environment create ideal conditions for evaluating player performances without weather interruptions. Additionally, the stadium's central location within the city provides easy access to nearby hotels, medical facilities, and convention centers, making it an efficient hub for all activities related to the Combine.The infrastructure of Indianapolis is another reason for its continued success as the Combine's host city. The well-planned civic design allows players, team personnel, and NFL executives to navigate easily between the stadium, accommodations, and medical facilities—all within walking distance. This seamless accessibility maximizes the efficiency of interviews, physical tests, and real-time medical evaluations, enabling NFL teams to optimize their talent scouting process.The NFL Combine is more than just a series of athletic tests; it is a tradition that has become a spectacle in its own right. Whether it's the 40-yard dash, bench press, or quarterback drills, every moment at the Combine feels more significant under the bright lights of Lucas Oil Stadium. The event has grown into a four-day football extravaganza that captures the attention of fans, scouts, and analysts alike.Despite speculation about moving the Combine to other cities, the NFL reaffirmed its commitment to Indianapolis by confirming that the event would remain there until at least 2026. This decision underscores the stability and consistency that Indianapolis offers, even as the NFL experiments with relocating other league events, such as the NFL Draft .Indianapolis's appeal extends beyond its central location and top-notch infrastructure. Known by many names, including Naptown, Hoosier City, and the Crossroads of America, the city has a rich cultural heritage and a vibrant atmosphere that enhances the overall experience of the Combine. Its reputation as a welcoming and efficient host city has solidified its place as the NFL Combine's permanent home.While Indianapolis continues to provide an unmatched environment for the NFL Combine, discussions about its future location have surfaced in recent years. In 2021, the NFL began accepting bids from other cities, hinting at the possibility of moving the event to capitalize on emerging markets. Nevertheless, Indianapolis remains the favored choice for now, with the Combine confirmed to be held in the Circle City through 2026.Despite the league's interest in exploring new markets, the practical advantages of Indianapolis are hard to overlook. Its strategic location, exceptional infrastructure, and rich tradition make it the perfect backdrop for the NFL Combine. While the future beyond 2026 remains uncertain, one thing is clear—Indianapolis has set a high standard that will be difficult to match.Also Read: Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt reveals emotional turmoil after team's Super Bowl 2025 loss in candid reflection As the NFL continues to evolve, so too may the location of its marquee events. But for now, Indianapolis stands as the unrivaled home of the NFL Combine, where football's next generation takes its first steps toward greatness.","Since 1987, Indianapolis has hosted this high-stakes event.

Cam Newton Defends Shilo and Shedeur Sanders Amid Nepotism Criticism



Cam Newton Gets Real About Dating NFL Stars, NO. 1 Pick Expectations + Using ChatGPT To Get Girls!?

Shilo and Shedeur Sanders have faced an intense amount of criticism throughout their football careers, with many attributing their success to nepotism due to their father, Deion Sanders . While living up to Deion’s legendary legacy is already a challenge, the added scrutiny has made their journey even more demanding. However, NFL veteran Cam Newton is not swayed by the ‘unfair advantage’ narrative surrounding the Sanders brothers.Not everyone can be criticized as nepotism product, at least Cam Newton does not think so. During an episode of Unapologetically Angel, Newton recently pointed out the frequent use of the term nepotism, emphasizing, ""They come up with all types of societal words and this year we’ve heard nepotism as much as any other thing."" Despite the criticism, Newton stands firmly in support of Deion Sanders, praising his role as a dedicated father who is actively shaping his sons' futures.Newton's perspective on the issue is deeply personal, as he is also a father guiding his children through the world of sports. With eight kids of his own, Newton is no stranger to the pressures and responsibilities of parenthood. His eldest son, Chosen Sebastian, is already making his mark in football, basketball, and track and field, while his daughter Sovereign-Dior Cambella and son Camidas Swain are actively participating in multiple sports.Having been in Deion’s shoes, Newton understands the importance of providing opportunities for his children. He also acknowledges the stigma surrounding Black fathers in society and believes that Deion has shattered those stereotypes. ""What Deion Sanders has been doing and has displayed, has been nothing less of a proud father,"" Newton explained. He emphasized that Deion’s active involvement in his children’s lives challenges the misconceptions about Black fatherhood, stating that Sanders has been ""smushing, killing, flushing, and murdering any type of thought process of what a Black father would be in this country.""Interestingly, Newton himself is a product of nepotism. His father, Cecil Newton Sr., played as a safety for the Cowboys and Bills in the 1980s, which helped Cam access valuable coaching and resources early in his career. However, Newton argues that while connections can open doors, maintaining success requires hard work and talent, which Shilo and Shedeur have undoubtedly demonstrated.Deion Sanders' influence on his sons goes beyond the football field. He has been a hands-on father, guiding Shilo and Shedeur through their athletic journeys and helping them shine even in challenging environments like Colorado’s football program. Their success story in the Big 12, despite the team’s struggles, shows their talent and Deion’s dedication.Newton defends Deion's actions, stating, ""To have been doing what he’s been doing for all of his kids, not just one or two of them, has been commendable, and for anybody who doesn’t like it, you just have to ask what would you do in that situation… If somebody’s son is good enough to play, of course, you want your son to play for you and you’re lying if you don’t."" This perspective resonates with many parents who wish to see their children succeed.Also Read: Justin Tucker’s sexual misconduct allegations spark debate over equal treatment with Browns' Deshaun Watson While critics may continue to label Shilo and Shedeur as beneficiaries of nepotism, Cam Newton views Deion’s efforts as a blueprint of fatherhood — a father ensuring his children carry on his legacy. The journey has not been easy, but the Sanders brothers are proving their worth on the field, showing that talent and perseverance are what truly define success.","Cam Newton is a product of nepotism, his father was a safety for the Cowboys and Bills in the 1980s. Newton believes that Deion Sanders has shattered stereotypes about Black fatherhood.

Joe Burrow Gets Heavily Trolled As The NFLPA Report Reveals Cincinnati Bengals Cafeteria Has Been Poorly Ranked



Fans Are Confused How It Is Possible For Cincinnati Bengals To Serve Low Quality Food To Its Players



Joe Burrow, the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, has found himself in a new controversy as a recent ranking has been released. As per the recent ranking, the Cincinnati Bengals have scored pretty poorly when it comes to the food that they serve to the players in their cafeteria. But this has not gone down too well with the fans, and Joe Burrow is being brutally trolled for it.As per the recent ranking, their food's freshness was rated 5.49/1,0 while their food had an average rating of 4.82 out of 10. Unfortunately, the Cincinnati Bengals’ cafeteria food and freshness has ranked last among all teams. But fans are in no mood for any sympathy and have dragged Joe Burrow into this.Warren Sharp recently made a post that read as “Bengals Cafeteria worse than prison” and fans have attacked the players. A fan wrote, “LMAO poor burrow has to walk thru traffic to get to the practice field and then they don't even feed him”, while another fan wrote, “Joe Burrow bringing his meals to the facility so he can eat.”A third fan wrote, “They need to save all that money to pay Joe, Chase and Higgins”, while another user wrote, “Imagine what Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase could do if they were served food greater than middle school cafeteria level.”Many fans also spoke about how the players have a massive net worth, and yet they are complaining about the food that is being served. A fan wrote, “Teams should supply some food. But why should they supply 3 meals a day? These guys make millions in most cases. They can feed themselves a meal or two a day.”Other fans are confused how it is possible for the Cincinnati Bengals to serve low quality food. A fan wrote, “How in the world could it be possible to have such a fiasco in a multi-billion-dollar business?”The team, Cincinnati Bengals, has not issued a statement about this poor ranking yet. It is not just the food that the team has ranked pretty poorly in. As per Warren Sharp’s post, even the dining area has been ranked poorly and got a score of 5.98 out of 10, which has ranked it in the 30th place out of 32 teams.Apart from this, the Cincinnati Bengals are also asking for three meals a day instead of two. Apparently, the Cincinnati Bengals are one of two teams that dont provide three meals a day.A statement from the team and the players is yet to be issued.Also Read: Joe Burrow’s old video resurfaces as he talks about quirky topics and fans fall for his ""nerdy"" charm","Cincinnati Bengals' cafeteria food and freshness has ranked last among all teams.

"Classified or declassified? Justice department releases Jeffrey Epstein files, but critics say they lack new revelations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/classified-or-declassified-justice-department-releases-jeffrey-epstein-files-but-critics-say-they-lack-new-revelations/articleshow/118614418.cms,"Conservative commentators outside White House with “The Epstein Files: Phase 1”

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender. Conservative influencers exiting the White House were seen carrying white binders labeled ""The Epstein Files: Phase 1,"" featuring the DOJ seal, and some held them up for cameras. The release came after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was confirmed earlier this month, had pledged to make files public, including flight logs and names of individuals involved. However, she had cautioned that certain information would remain undisclosed to protect over 250 victims.Despite the anticipation surrounding the release, the DOJ later acknowledged that the files contained little new information. A review of the documents found them heavily redacted and largely composed of details that had already been publicly reported. While the binders were marked ""declassified,"" it remained unclear whether they had ever been classified in the first place.The limited scope of the release led to criticism, even from some Republicans. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, voiced her disappointment, stating, ""I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today … A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein’s phonebook. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!""The manner of the release also sparked controversy online, as the DOJ provided access to the files to a select group of conservative commentators, including Rogan O’Handley (DC Draino), Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, podcaster Liz Wheeler, and Jack Posobiec, among others. By Thursday evening, the files had not been made available to DOJ reporters or posted publicly online, leading to criticism that the rollout resembled the 'Twitter Files'—the selective disclosure of internal Twitter communications by Elon Musk to independent journalists in 2022-23.Social media users questioned why the DOJ had chosen to distribute the documents exclusively to certain influencers rather than making them accessible to the general public. “Trump did exactly what I was afraid of, just like Elon did with the 'Twitter Files.' The Epstein files should have been released on a website to the public, not just to a few select people. Any of these ‘influencers’ who don’t immediately scan and publicly post the entire binder will have outed themselves as a grifting gatekeeping POS,” one person wrote on X.Another commenter stated, ""Not blackpilling, but today's Epstein stunt is unfortunately delegitimizing and a poor attempt at recreating some kind of 'Twitter Files' type exposé. We have all the power now, so we don’t need influencers to leak stuff. Use the government. That’s why we put you in power.""The criticism highlighted concerns over transparency and the selective nature of the document distribution. Many argued that the DOJ should have published the files on an official government website, rather than allowing certain influencers to control how and when the information was shared. “This smells like the Twitter Files again. Select individuals receive the information and decide how to release it. Create a link on a government website and every American can access and review it. Why the gatekeeping? I hope I am wrong,” another user wrote.Epstein’s criminal history has been well-documented over the years, with multiple lawsuits, police reports, and public disclosures outlining his abuse of underage girls, some as young as 14. His crimes allegedly involved high-profile figures, including politicians, celebrities, and royalty. His death in 2019, ruled a suicide while awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail, only fueled speculation and calls for greater transparency regarding his connections and the extent of his criminal network.In January 2024, a court unsealed a significant batch of documents from a lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre. The materials included police reports and victim testimonies that had already been widely circulated. Bondi, in her interview with Fox News ahead of the document release, hinted at their contents but stopped short of confirming whether they would contain new revelations beyond what was already known.The DOJ’s move to release the files was framed as part of its commitment to transparency. However, with many of the materials already publicly available and key details redacted, critics—both online and in Congress—expressed disappointment, arguing that the public deserved full disclosure rather than a controlled release through select individuals.","The US Department of Justice on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.

Accidental activation raises safety concerns

What affected customers should do

Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs. The advisory, posted on Wednesday, follows reports of incidents where the stovetop elements were unintentionally turned on by people or pets, reports CBS news.According to Health Canada, the issue affects more than 137,000 units sold in the country between 2016 and June 2024. As of February 12, LG Electronics Canada had received eight reports of such incidents, including two minor injuries—a cut and a burn.The affected models have five stovetop elements and control knobs positioned at the front, just above the oven door. If accidentally bumped, these knobs can turn on the heating elements, posing a fire risk.A similar recall has been issued in the United States, where approximately 500,000 units were sold between 2015 and January 2025. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported at least 86 cases of unintended activation, resulting in eight minor injuries and five fires, with property damage exceeding $340,000 USD. Tragically, three of these fires involved pet fatalities.Owners of the recalled models do not need to discard their stoves but should take immediate action. LG Electronics Canada advises customers to check the model number, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer, and compare it with the recall list.Once identified, customers should contact LG to receive a free warning label and instructions on its placement.

Carl Feynman: 'I'm outdone in minutes': Computer engineer says AI has surpassed years of his work in a flash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-outdone-in-minutes-computer-engineer-says-ai-has-surpassed-years-of-his-work-in-a-flash/articleshow/118596710.cms,"Carl Feynman

Who is Carl Feynman?

Carl Feynman , son of American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman , pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986. He was both amazed and concerned by AI’s rapid progress. After seeing an AI create a cloth animation in minutes, he shared his thoughts on X, noting how quickly artificial intelligence is outpacing human effort.“I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?” Feynman posted, acknowledging how quickly AI models are mastering complex simulations that once required months of research and powerful computers.The conversation began when an X user shared their experience with Sonnet 3.7, an AI model with reasoning capabilities, which successfully generated an intricate cloth simulation in p5.js—a task that had stumped other leading AI models, including Grok 3 and o1 Pro.""Can you write the most intricate cloth simulation in p5js,"" was the prompt put by the X user.Recognizing the significance of this breakthrough, the user said: “Wow, Sonnet 3.7 w/ Thinking just solved a problem no other model could solve yet.”The reaction by Feynman to the simulation quickly gained traction, with the user pointing out Feynman’s legacy: “The man who literally invented modeling cloth in computer graphics at MIT in 1986 saw the video where Claude creates a cloth animation and says: ‘I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?’”Carl Feynman, the son of renowned physicist Richard Feynman, made significant contributions to computer graphics by developing early methods for simulating cloth movement. His work laid the groundwork for realistic fabric simulations used in films, video games, and virtual reality. In 1986, his master’s thesis, “Modeling the Appearance of Cloth,” was a pioneering achievement in the field.Reflecting on that time, Feynman noted: “It took library research and cleverness and originality and months of work and days of time on big computers. Now I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes.”While AI continues to break barriers in computational creativity, Feynman’s words highlight an underlying concern: the speed at which AI is advancing, raising questions about the future of human expertise in fields that once relied on deep technical skill and years of experience.","Carl Feynman pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986.

Upcoming Moon landings

Athena is one of several commercial lunar landers launching this year. On January 15, a Falcon 9 rocket carried two other landers:

Blue Ghost (by Firefly Aerospace), part of Nasa's CLPS program, is set to land on March 2 in the Mare Crisium region.

Resilience (Hakuto-R Mission 2 by Ispace), taking an indirect trajectory, is expected to land in May near the Mare Frigoris region.

Ispace’s first mission in 2023 ended in a crash, making this its second attempt at a successful lunar landing.

Intuitive Machines’ second lunar lander, Athena, is on its way to the Moon after launching aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday evening. The lander is scheduled to attempt a touchdown on March 6 in the Mons Mouton region, about 100 miles from the Moon’s south pole—closer than any previous spacecraft has landed.After launch, Athena successfully powered on, though a delay in its initial check-in caused a brief moment of suspense at Intuitive Machines’ mission control before data confirmed its status.Athena’s descent will be closely monitored, especially given the lessons learned from Intuitive Machines’ first lander, Odysseus, which landed on the Moon in February 2024 but tipped over upon touchdown. Engineers have conducted extensive testing to ensure Athena avoids a similar fate.The mission is expected to last approximately 10 Earth days, as the solar-powered lander will cease operations when the sun sets on the lunar surface. However, on March 14 at about 2 am ET, Athena will experience a brief eclipse when the Earth moves between the Moon and the sun. The lander will rely on battery power during this period but is expected to survive.The Moon landing will be streamed live on SpaceX’s social media platforms, including YouTube and X. Nasa will also broadcast the event on Nasa+, while Intuitive Machines will provide real-time updates on its official X account.Athena’s primary payload is a Nasa drill designed to extract lunar soil and analyze its composition for compounds like frozen water. The mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which aims to leverage commercial partners for Moon exploration.Additionally, the lander is carrying three robotic rovers and a small rocket-powered “hopper.” One rover, the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform (MAPP), is designed to help test the first cellphone network on the Moon. Built by Lunar Outpost, it will carry a Nokia antenna as part of a Nasa-funded technology demonstration. A tiny MIT-built rover called AstroAnt will ride atop MAPP. Another rover, Yaoki, from Japanese company Dymon, is also on board.The small hopper, developed under another Nasa contract, is designed to explore hard-to-reach areas using thrusters, similar to how the Ingenuity helicopter operates on Mars. It will attempt to fly into one of the Moon’s permanently shadowed craters while carrying another Nokia antenna.Odysseus, Intuitive Machines’ first lunar lander, reached the Moon’s surface in 2024 but tipped over due to a software issue that rendered its laser altimeter inactive. Engineers had to hastily rewrite the landing software using data from an experimental Nasa instrument, but a key parameter was overlooked, causing the spacecraft to land at an incorrect angle.Athena is nearly identical in design to Odysseus, known as the Nova-C model, but extensive testing has been conducted to ensure its laser altimeter functions correctly.Three additional spacecraft hitched a ride on the Falcon 9 rocket.","Intuitive Machines’ second lunar lander, Athena, is on its way to the Moon after launching aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday evening.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What’s new in OpenAI’s GPT 4.5



GPT 4.5 availability

What Sam Altman said about GPT 4.5

GPT-4.5 is ready!

good news: it is the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person to me. i have had several moments where i've sat back in my chair and been astonished at getting actually good advice from an AI.

bad news: it is a giant, expensive model. we really wanted to launch it to plus and pro at the same time, but we've been growing a lot and are out of GPUs. we will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week and roll it out to the plus tier then. (hundreds of thousands coming soon, and i'm pretty sure y'all will use every one we can rack up.)

this isn't how we want to operate, but it's hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages.

a heads up: this isn’t a reasoning model and won’t crush benchmarks. it’s a different kind of intelligence and there’s a magic to it i haven’t felt before. really excited

for people to try it!

OpenAI has launched GPT-4.5, its newest and largest AI language model . At first, it will be available as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users. OpenAI is calling it their ""most knowledgeable model yet,"" but warns that it may not perform as well as some other models like o1 or o3-mini. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that GPT-4.5 is a ""giant, expensive model"" and that it ""won’t crush benchmarks.""The company says that GPT-4.5 comes with better writing skills, improved general knowledge, and a more refined personality than past versions. OpenAI claims conversations with GPT-4.5 will feel more natural, and it is better at recognizing patterns and making connections.However, OpenAI notes that GPT-4.5 is not a major breakthrough model. A leaked document revealed that it improves GPT-4’s efficiency by more than 10 times but does not introduce seven completely new reasoning capabilities. This mention was later removed from OpenAI’s official announcement.It was earlier reported that OpenAI used its o1 model, codenamed Strawberry, to train GPT-4.5 with synthetic data. OpenAI confirms that GPT-4.5 was trained using a mix of new supervision techniques along with traditional methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), similar to GPT-4o.Despite its limitations, OpenAI says GPT-4.5 has fewer hallucinations than GPT-4o and slightly fewer than o1. Researcher Raphael Gontijo Lopes stated that GPT-4.5 was designed to be a better conversation partner, making discussions feel warmer and more intuitive. In tests, human evaluators rated it higher than GPT-4o in almost every category.As mentioned above, GPT 4.5 is currently available for ChatGPT Pro users. OpenAI will expand GPT-4.5 access to Plus and Team users next week, followed by Enterprise and Edu users. It is also available now on Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry platform, alongside models from Stability, Cohere, and Microsoft.In the X post, Altman wrote:","OpenAI has launched GPT-4.5, its newest and largest AI language model.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.
