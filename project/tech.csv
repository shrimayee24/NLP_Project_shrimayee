In a humorous new promo for the upcoming Invictus Games, Prince Harry shared a lighthearted moment with country singer Jelly Roll , where he joked about getting a tattoo on his lower back or 'a**.' The video, shared on Instagram, shows the Duke of Sussex sitting in a tattoo chair at East Side Ink tattoo shop in New York City, awaiting his “artist.”“Is he going to be here any time soon?” Harry asked, to which a staff member assured him the tattoo artist would arrive shortly.The suspense was quickly broken when Jelly Roll, whose real name is Jason Bradley DeFord, walked in wearing black gloves and greeted the prince with enthusiasm. “Hey, hey! Tattoos. Speaking of, what’s up, man?” the country star said, adding that he was “such a fan” of Harry.Jelly Roll expressed his surprise upon learning that Prince Harry wanted him to give him his first tattoo, but Harry clarified that he wasn’t there for a tattoo. Instead, he wanted Jelly to help promote the Invictus Games, which are set to take place in Vancouver in February 2025.Harry humorously added, “There’s no tattoo in this. I can’t get a tattoo.” However, Jelly Roll insisted that if Harry allowed him to give him a tattoo, they could play a game for the Invictus Games. With that, Harry gave in, saying, “Aight, screw it. Let’s go.”When Jelly suggested getting the tattoo on Harry’s neck, the prince joked, “I was thinking like, my lower back or my a**,” adding, “That’s the place where no one’s going to see it.” The singer then went on to jokingly tattoo “I am Jelly Roll” on Harry’s neck, which caused both men to laugh before Jelly quickly exited the room.The video ended with a message announcing Jelly Roll’s performance at the Invictus Games closing ceremony on February 16, 2025.Prince Harry, who founded the Invictus Games in 2014, has worked to create an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.

French plastic surgeon suspended after patients claim he left them with 'potato' noses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-plastic-surgeon-suspended-after-patients-complaint-he-left-them-with-potato-noses/articleshow/115609823.cms,"Olivier Gerbault (Picture credit: Gerbault Chirurgien Esthétique instagram handle)

A well-known French plastic surgeon , Olivier Gerbault , has been suspended from practicing for two years after multiple patients accused him of performing unsatisfactory nose surgeries. Gerbault , known for his ultrasonic rhinoplasty technique, allegedly left some patients with breathing difficulties and deformities.Several women who filed complaints with the medical ethics committee described their noses as resembling ""potatoes"" after the procedures, according to a New York Post report. Elisa, one of the patients, said:“My nose was long, crooked, thick, and looked like a potato. My left nostril was collapsing, and I couldn’t get any air through.”Another patient, Chloé, reported similar experiences, claiming her nose became infected and her nostrils collapsed after the surgery. She said:“I had a lump [in place of my nose], a big potato. From then on, I lost all taste for life.”Alix, another patient, alleged Gerbault inserted a chin prosthesis without her consent during her rhinoplasty.“I feel like I’ve been mutilated,"" Alix said, as quoted by New York Post. ""When I woke up, I was vomiting liters of blood. The doctor must have used a trowel. Since then, I’ve had a horrible burning sensation, air rushes in too strongly, and it gets on my nerves. Gerbault has ruined my life.”Gerbault, 58, received a two-year ban in November 2023.Despite the suspension, Gerbault continues to practice with permission from local authorities. He denies all allegations, claiming the complaints are part of a smear campaign orchestrated by a rival surgeon.“These patients are all connected and the complaints are strictly the same, sometimes down to the last word. It’s obvious they are being helped by a colleague, which is particularly serious and unprofessional,” Gerbault said, as quoted by New York Post.The surgeon is currently appealing the suspension.","Olivier Gerbault, a well-known French plastic surgeon, has been suspended from practicing for two years.

Grimes Channels Pain Into Art



Claire Grimes Boucher , widely known as Grimes, has spoken candidly about her evolving relationship with Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX , with whom she shares three children. In a heartfelt post on X (formerly Twitter), the Canadian artist revealed how Musk's political transformation and personal decisions have profoundly impacted their bond, leading her to describe him as ""no longer the man I fell in love with.""Grimes (Claire Boucher) and Elon Musk met in a way that highlights their shared interests in technology and creativity.Their first interaction took place on Twitter in early 2018, when Musk was preparing to tweet a joke about artificial intelligence and a pun involving a character from 18th-century philosophy.Musk had come up with a joke about a thought experiment known as ""Roko's Basilisk,"" blending it with a pun on ""Rococo,"" an ornate art style. However, he discovered that Grimes had already made a similar joke in 2015 through her music video for ""Flesh Without Blood,"" where she referenced ""Rococo Basilisk."" Impressed by her wit and intrigued by her knowledge of esoteric topics, Musk reached out to her.The two connected over their shared fascination with futuristic ideas, artificial intelligence, and creative exploration. Their mutual appreciation for the intersection of art and technology sparked a rapport, and their online conversation soon turned into a real-life meeting. By May 2018, they made their first public appearance as a couple at the Met Gala, surprising many fans and media observers.However, their bond became strained over time due to their differing lifestyles and public scrutiny. Despite having two children together, they announced in 2021 that they were ""semi-separated.""Grimes shared her struggle in detaching from Musk, whom she once described as the love of her life. She highlighted how his shift towards conservative political ideologies, including his contentious relationship with his transgender daughter , Vivian Jenna Wilson, has made him seem ""unrecognizable"" to her. The artist has been vocal in her support for Vivian, contrasting with Musk’s alleged actions that she finds difficult to reconcile with the person she once knew.Musk's increasing alignment with right-wing politics, including his support for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, appears to have widened the gap between him and Grimes. While she has remained apolitical in public, the ideological differences seem to have strained their personal connection.In her post, Grimes hinted at significant challenges beyond their political differences. She alluded to feeling distanced from Musk’s intellectual and financial resources during their separation. She also mentioned the pain of being separated from one of their children for five months amid legal disputes. These revelations underscore the emotional toll their relationship has taken, though Grimes emphasized that some details remain private.Despite the turmoil, Grimes expressed how her personal challenges have inspired her creativity. She revealed that her upcoming artistic projects, while potentially provocative, are deeply rooted in her experiences. Grimes hopes her work will resonate with those who can relate to the complexities of love, change, and resilience.","Claire Grimes Boucher, widely known as Grimes, has spoken candidly about her evolving relationship with Elon Musk.

The slice remains carefully preserved in its original small box, featuring a silver insignia of the then-Princess Elizabeth and contains an ornate doily, CNN reported.The cake was originally dispatched from Buckingham Palace to Marion Polson, who served as housekeeper at Holyrood House in Edinburgh, Scotland, as a token from the royal couple.Polson also received a letter of gratitude from Elizabeth for ""such a delightful wedding present.""The letter, typed and signed by Elizabeth, stated: ""We are both enchanted with the dessert service; the different flowers and the beautiful colouring will, I know, be greatly admired by all who see it.""""This is a present which we shall use constantly, and whenever we shall think of the kindness and good wishes for our happiness which it represents.""The original wedding cake stood impressively at nine-foot tall (2.7 metres), weighing 500 pounds.The cake's decorations included both families' coats of arms and sugar-iced figures depicting the couple's preferred activities.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Court order to Discord

The 'big Netflix leak'

Earlier this year, Netflix suffered from a massive leak that saw full episodes and pictures of some of its most popular shows including Terminator Zero, Arcane, Squid Game and Ranma 1/2 leak online ahead of their official release. Streaming giant Netflix had then released an official statement saying that it was “actively taking action” against the perpetrator of the leaks.It now appears, it may have found some lead here. Netflix is enlisting the help of Discord to track down the individual responsible for leaking unreleased footage of its Blockbuster shows. According to a report in Polygon, ""Netflix is looking toward Discord for help in figuring out who, exactly, is leaking unreleased footage from some of its popular shows.""The Northern District of California court recently issued a subpoena to compel Discord to share information that can help identify the Discord user who’s reportedly involved in leaking episodes and images from these popular Netflix shows. Documents filed alongside the subpoena reportedly specifically call out an unreleased and copyrighted photo from the second season of Squid Game, posted by a Discord user @jacejohns4n.The leak, which occurred in August, is believed to have originated from a security breach at Lyuno, a post-production studio that works with major streaming platforms. “One of our post production partners has been compromised and footage from several of our titles has unfortunately leaked online. Our team is aggressively taking action to have it taken down,” a Netflix representative told press at the time.In a statement published on Lyuno's website, a company spokesperson said, “Iyuno is aware of a recent security issue, involving unauthorized access to confidential content.” “Protecting our clients’ confidentiality and ensuring the security of their content is our highest priority. We are actively investigating this security breach to mitigate any potential risks and identify the responsible parties.”Other than Netflix, Lyuno's other customers include Amazon Studios, BBC, Disney, HBO, and DreamWorks.","Netflix is enlisting the help of Discord to track down the individual responsible for leaking unreleased footage of its Blockbuster shows.

What Apple has to say

Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers. The regulator also targeted Google’s $20 billion search deal with Apple in keeping the revenues flowing for the companies.The CMA's inquiry group specifically criticised Apple's requirement that all iOS browsers use its WebKit engine, which limits the functionality and differentiation of competing browsers.“The group has provisionally found that Apple’s rules restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers. Other browser providers have highlighted concerns that they have been unable to offer a full range of browser features, such as faster webpage loading on iPhone. Many smaller UK app developers also told us that they would like to use progressive web apps – an alternative way for businesses to provide apps to mobile users without downloading apps through an app store – but this technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the CMA said.The CMA's report also highlights a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google, suggesting that the arrangement reduces their incentive to compete with each other.“In addition, the group has provisionally found that a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS,” it added.The CMA launched its investigation into Apple and Google's mobile dominance in 2021, focusing on app store practices, browsers and cloud gaming. While the CMA has dropped the cloud gaming aspect of its probe due to recent changes by Apple, it maintains concerns about Apple's browser policies.“The CMA is inviting comments on its provisional findings by December 13 and expects to make a final decision in March 2025,” it added.An Apple spokesperson said that it disagrees with the findings, as per a report by TechCrunch.",The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers.
