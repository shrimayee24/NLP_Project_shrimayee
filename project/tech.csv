Eric Kilburn Jr. , a 16-year-old football star from Goodrich High School in Michigan, has made headlines by setting two Guinness World Records for having the largest feet and hands of any living teenager. Standing tall at 6'10"", Eric wears size 23 shoes, which measure an astonishing 13.5 inches, while his hands span 9.13 inches—significantly larger than the average size.""People are usually amazed and feel comfortable starting conversations with me about the size of my feet and hands,” Kilburn shared with Guinness.This unique characteristic has not only made him a standout on the football field but has also allowed him to connect with many interesting individuals.Eric's extraordinary height has presented its fair share of challenges. Since fifth grade, he struggled to find shoes that fit, as typical stores didn't carry his size. Custom-made footwear, which can cost over $1,500, was often out of reach for him and his family. In Michigan's harsh winters, he faced painful foot issues from wearing ill-fitting Crocs.Eric's story captured the attention of major brands like Under Armour and Reebok, as well as NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, who stepped in to provide him with properly fitting shoes. ""I was deeply moved by the outpouring of support and kindness from strangers. It was truly inspiring to see how many people genuinely care about helping others,"" he remarked.In response to the kindness he received, Eric and his mother launched theBig Shoe Network . ""I want to pay it forward and help those struggling to find clothes and shoes that fit, just like I was helped when I needed it most,"" he explained.In an exclusive interview with Guinness World Records, Kilburn expressed his gratitude for being part of the 2025 edition.

Dubai, renowned for its opulent skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa and Princess Tower, epitomises luxury and a high quality of life. Each year, countless individuals flock to this vibrant desert metropolis in search of better opportunities and brighter futures. Yet, the story behind Dubai’s impressive skyline often overlooks the lives of the many labourers who work tirelessly to construct it.A significant portion of these workers come from India, earning daily wages as construction labourers in this bustling city.Recently, a viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers, igniting widespread outrage. This heartbreaking reality was brought to the forefront by Instagram user Md Rafique, whose video revealed a seldom-seen aspect of Dubai: the overcrowded and inadequate living spaces many workers endure. The viral video reveals the living conditions of many migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, providing internet users with a stark glimpse into their struggles. The footage, which is circulating widely online, has ignited significant debate about the inhumane conditions these workers face.The footage shows a large hall with a tin roof, packed with shabby dormitories stacked closely together. Rows of bunk beds stretch on, illustrating the cramped quarters that thousands of workers call home after long, gruelling days on construction sites.The makeshift accommodations house workers from various countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, China, and India. After labouring under the relentless sun, these men return each night to rest in conditions that offer little comfort.The video has struck a chord with viewers, amassing over two million views and sparking discussions about the plight of these labourers. Comments reflect a mix of sympathy and outrage. One viewer lamented, “This is heartbreaking! They deserve so much better for all their hard work.” Another emphasised the need for advocacy for change, while some shared personal experiences, with one recalling, “I worked in Dubai years ago and witnessed this firsthand. It’s time the world knows.”Many have likened the situation to an animal farm. Pranav Roy remarked, “It’s no different than a chicken farm .” Tushar Jalavadiya advised, “You might as well stay in India with your family; no one should have to earn money under such conditions.” Radhika commented, “They claim to earn well in Dubai, but the reality is revealed online.” Ashwani Atwal stated, “It’s nothing more than a jail.”However, not all feedback was negative. Adil Chaudhary pointed out that workers receive a three-hour break during the summer, and that there are air-conditioned rooms and toilets available. He also noted that buses transport workers to and from their living quarters, with a rule that no room can house more than six people in Dubai.Many are calling for greater accountability from the companies employing these workers, with one comment stating, “These companies need to be held responsible for the living conditions of their workers!”","A viral video has shed light on the harsh living conditions faced by Dubai’s labourers.

Jesus: Why are christians calling for a boycott of Coca-Cola over 'Jesus' custom cans?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-are-christians-calling-for-a-boycott-of-coca-cola-over-jesus-custom-cans/articleshow/113678310.cms,"Coca-Cola machine refusing to print the name “Jesus” (Photo: Antwoine Hill)

A video showing a Coca-Cola machine refusing to print the name “Jesus” on a custom soda can has sparked outrage among some Christian consumers , leading to calls for a boycott of the beverage giant. According to Daily Dot , the online drama began with a Facebook post by Antwoine Hill, who demonstrated at a Coca-Cola store how he could write the names of various religious figures, including “Allah” and “Satan,” but not “Jesus.” When attempting to print “Jesus,” Hill received an error message showing, “Sadly, we cannot automatically allow this text on the can!”.Hill's video prompted hundreds of comments, with many users vowing to stop purchasing Coca-Cola products. One woman declared, “We need to STOP buying coke!!! I’m done,” while another urged fellow Christians to avoid Coke products, stating, “The only language corporations understand is money.”The controversy also gained traction on X, where influencers encouraged Christians to withdraw their support for Coca-Cola.When the Daily Dot attempted to create a custom can with the name “Jesus” on the Coca-Cola website, they received a similar error message. According to the company, phrases may be rejected for various reasons, including being trademarked or potentially offensive.Despite the backlash, Hill expressed mixed feelings about the situation, saying, “This isn’t real persecution. I’m pointing out the obvious.” He supports the boycott to convey the importance of the name Jesus but acknowledges larger societal issues, saying, “I’m in the streets daily seeing the much bigger issues, drugs, violence, homelessness.”","A video showing a Coca-Cola machine refusing to print the name ""Jesus"" has sparked outrage among some Christian consumers.

By the autumnal equinox Sunday, Danni Capalbo had already had her fall game plan in place for weeks. She would spend the coming months wrapped in cozy layers in her apartment in Boston, stirring up steaming vats of carbohydrates. Her inspiration for the season is a benevolent witch she met in the hills of Calabria, Italy, many years ago: Strega Nona , the title character of a 1975 children's book of the same name by Tomie dePaola .""She's so relatable,"" Capalbo, 28, said. ""She's a little Italian witch who makes pasta all the time."" She first encountered the character in her childhood library. But lately she has been seeing Strega Nona pop up on social media, recast by adults as a patron saint of autumnal nostalgia. She joined in by posting a tribute to the character that has been viewed over 300,000 times on TikTok. Other fans have enumerated the signs of a ""Strega Nona September,"" or joked that they were trading the chaos of "" brat summer "" for a more wholesome ""Strega Nona fall.""If these posts are an outgrowth of the online habit of branding every season, they also represent an enduring fascination with a character known for her quiet way of life and gently administered lessons - not exactly the typical recipe for internet fame. Strega Nona, whose name means ""Grandmother Witch"", is a healer who enchants townspeople with her magically refilling pasta pot. When she recruits the help of a young man named Big Anthony, he bungles the spell that is supposed to halt pasta-making. The town overflows with noodles. Margaret Duncan, 29, a healthcare worker in Boston, finds herself reaching for characters like Strega Nona every autumn, when her nostalgia swells with the back-to-school season. ""I think that there's a longing for simplicity,"" she said. ""Her biggest problem is that this young man who helps her made too much pasta."" Even that problem Strega Nona is able to solve: She hands Big Anthony a fork and tells him to start eating.The illustrations in the book, also by dePaola, feature the rich colours of the Italian countryside. Capalbo said the book conjured a certain snug atmosphere that was welcome as she hunkers down for colder weather. The character's witchiness, she added, is also a nice prelude to Halloween. ""Everyone has their big fun summer,"" she said. ""Now you just want to be cozy and make pasta from your magic pasta pot"".","Strega Nona is the title character of a 1975 children's book of the same name by Tomie dePaola.

The Solar Boat is approximately 4,600 years old, dating back to the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt.

The vessel measures 42 meters (138 feet) in length and weighs around 20 tons.

It was discovered in 1954 by Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh, located at the southern corner of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

The Solar Boat is considered one of the oldest and largest wooden ships ever found, representing advanced ancient Egyptian shipbuilding techniques.

It was believed that such boats were buried with pharaohs to aid them in their journey to the afterlife, reflecting the religious beliefs of the time.

The boat is made from high-quality cedar wood, showcasing the materials and craftsmanship of ancient Egyptian shipbuilders.

Extensive restoration efforts have been undertaken, guided by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities' chief restorer, Ahmed Youssef Moustafa.

The vessel was moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum using a remote-controlled vehicle within a protective metal cage, taking 48 hours for the operation.

The Grand Egyptian Museum, scheduled to open later this year, will feature the Solar Boat among over 100,000 artifacts from ancient Egypt.

The Solar Boat not only enhances our understanding of ancient maritime practices but also serves as a symbol of Egypt's rich cultural heritage and its fascination with the afterlife.

The ancient Solar Boat of King Khufu has recently been relocated from its long-time resting place near the Great Pyramid of Giza to the upcoming Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM). This 4,600-year-old vessel, known for being one of the oldest and largest wooden ships discovered, provides invaluable insights into ancient Egyptian civilization and its maritime practices.Discovered in 1954 by archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh, the boat was originally buried alongside the Great Pyramid, believed to aid the pharaoh in his journey to the afterlife.Officials from Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced that the boat's transport was meticulously planned to ensure its preservation for future generations. Weighing approximately 20 tons and measuring 42 meters (138 feet) in length, the vessel was moved over a 48-hour period using a specially designed remote-controlled vehicle, encased in a protective metal structure. This operation marks a significant step in safeguarding one of the world's oldest intact ships, a testament to the advanced shipbuilding techniques of ancient Egypt.","The Solar Boat is approximately 4,600 years old, dating back to the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt.

Shortly after, a grand jury indicted him on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and illegal transportation for sexual activities, to which Combs pleaded not guilty.In an attempt to secure bail, Combs’ legal team, led by Marc Agnifilo, proposed a $50 million bond package, using the Star Island home as collateral and backed by six passports from Combs and his family to demonstrate that he wasn’t a flight risk. Despite this, the judge denied bail, citing concerns of potential violence, flight, or interference in the ongoing investigation.Combs’ decision to clear the mortgage was likely a tactic to leverage Florida's Homestead Act, a law that safeguards homeowners from losing the equity in their primary residence regardless of legal troubles. This same law allowed O.J. Simpson to retain his Florida home despite a $100 million judgment against him. By settling his mortgage, Combs ensured the protection of his main asset against any legal ramifications.The bond hearing shed light on Combs’ extravagant lifestyle. His Star Island mansion, purchased for $14.5 million in 2003, has since transformed into a sprawling 14,800-square-foot estate, complete with multiple pools, a spa, and cabana-style pool houses, now valued at $48.5 million.Combs cleared the mansion’s mortgage in August, in anticipation of legal complications. Although this was acknowledged as a poor business decision, it was a calculated effort to gain the court’s trust.Star Island, a 55-acre exclusive enclave inhabited by billionaires and celebrities, is no stranger to high-profile residents. Combs, who acquired another mansion next door for $35 million in 2021, chose only his primary residence for the bail proposal, which ultimately failed.Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, a prominent figure in the music and entertainment industry, also known by aliases like Puff Daddy and P. Diddy , faces serious allegations that could tarnish his legacy. Born in Harlem in 1969, Combs rose to fame as a music producer and entrepreneur in the 1990s, establishing Bad Boy Records and launching the careers of artists such as The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, and Mase. He later expanded into fashion with his Sean John clothing line, spirits through Ciroc Vodka, and media with REVOLT TV, amassing a multi-million dollar empire.Combs is now embroiled in a federal case that alleges involvement in "" freak-offs ,"" described as sexually charged gatherings held in luxury hotels. Prosecutors claim he engaged in coercive, abusive, and criminal sexual activities at these events. The indictment details charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, arson, bribery, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice. It describes these ""freak-offs"" as involving prostitutes, excessive drug use, and substantial amounts of baby oil, all recorded on video by Combs, who allegedly used the footage to maintain control over participants. Some individuals were reportedly so physically drained from these events that they required intravenous fluids to recover, with a clean-up crew later restoring the hotel rooms.Central to the case is Cassie Ventura , a singer and Combs' former girlfriend, who filed a civil lawsuit alleging years of abuse and forced participation in the ""freak-offs."" Her lawsuit detailed how Combs directed her to use excessive oil, engage with prostitutes, and filmed the encounters as ""personal art projects,"" even adjusting lighting for effect. Ventura settled her lawsuit a day after filing, but her claims prompted a broader investigation, encouraging others to come forward with similar allegations.These accusations coincide with heightened discussions on power, consent, and gender equality, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The case has provoked debates on how powerful figures exploit their influence and how society addresses allegations involving wealthy, high-profile individuals. Some politicians have used this case to advocate for stricter laws on sex trafficking and better support for survivors, while others stress the importance of accountability regardless of status or wealth.Combs' legal team denies all allegations, asserting that the ""freak-offs"" were consensual. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, claims interviews with men identified as sex workers in the indictment revealed no evidence of coercion. Nevertheless, the allegations have subjected Combs to intense public scrutiny, with many expressing disappointment in him, given his status as a cultural icon and social justice advocate. His business ventures have also felt the impact, with some partners distancing themselves.As the case progresses, it remains a significant topic in discussions about power dynamics, racial stereotyping, and the criminal justice system, especially amidst ongoing social and political debates.","Hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs cleared the mortgage on his $48.5 million Star Island mansion just before charges were brought against him.

Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines.

Step 4:

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Popular YouTuber and influencer Ranveer Allahbadia has fallen victim to a cyber attack that resulted in both of his YouTube channels being hacked and renamed ""Tesla”. Also, all the videos available on both the channels were deleted.The hackers reporetedly used a deceptive livestream featuring an AI-generated Elon Musk avatar, urging viewers to invest cryptocurrency for a false promise of doubling their returns.The avatar directs viewers to scan a QR code and deposit Bitcoin or Ethereum on a suspicious website, elonweb.net. This tactic is a classic ""Bitcoin doubling"" scam, commonly used in cyberattacks targeting high-profile YouTube channels.The channels have been deleted from YouTube. Previously, when we attempted to search for the channels, YouTube displayed a message stating that they had been removed due to a violation of the company's policies. However, now the live streaming platform shows a message, ‘This page isn't available. Sorry about that.

Meta’s AI buddy just got a Hollywood makeover

AI to take over your Facebook and Instagram feed

Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses get smarter: Real-time translation and more

Meta's artificial intelligence just got a major upgrade. At the company's Connect event, Meta announced that its AI can now talk to you using celebrity voices, edit your photos, and even create personalised content for your social media feeds.Imagine chatting with an AI that sounds like John Cena or Dame Judi Dench. That's now possible if you're using WhatsApp Facebook , or Instagram in the United States.Meta AI can speak with voices from several celebrities, including Awkwafina, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen BellBut that's not all. Meta AI can now look at your photos and answer questions about them. Want to know how to make that cake in your picture? Just ask, and the AI will try to find a recipe for you. It can even change things in your photos, like swapping out your outfit or adding a rainbow to the background. This new capability is powered by Meta's latest AI model, Llama 3.2, which can understand both images and text.Meta also showed off a live demo of the AI video call feature that’ll let people chit chat with a creator’s AI personality.Meta is also testing something new for your Facebook and Instagram feeds. Soon, you might see AI-created images made just for you. These ""Imagined for You"" pictures could even include your face in fun scenarios, like being a video game character or an astronaut. Users will have the option to share these images or generate new ones in real-time.You can use the Meta AI on Instagram too, when you share a photo from your feed to your Instagram Stories. The AI looks at the photo, figures out what it’s about, and then creates a background for your Story.For video creators and viewers, Meta is working on AI that can automatically translate Reels. It will change the speaker's voice to another language and match their lips to the new words. This feature will start with English and Spanish in the US and Latin America, with plans to expand to more languages in the future. Mark Zuckerberg , Meta's CEO, showed off some cool updates for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses too. These glasses will be able to translate conversations in real-time and understand more natural ways of talking to the AI. Users won't always have to say ""Hey Meta"" to activate the AI, making interactions smoother and more natural. Not just that but they’ll also remember things for you by snapping pictures.Zuckerberg also announced the new AI model, Llama 3.2. It's smarter than ever and can understand both pictures and words.While these changes sound exciting, they also bring up questions about privacy and how AI might change our social media experience. The introduction of AI-generated content in feeds and the use of users' faces in AI-created images raise concerns about consent and data usage. Meta says it's just testing these features for now, and it's not clear how quickly they'll roll out to all users.","Meta's new AI model, Llama 3.2, is smarter than ever and can understand both pictures and words.
