'It's time to make re-wearing outfits fashionable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-time-to-make-re-wearing-outfits-fashionable/articleshow/113648553.cms,"Reusable fashion vs fast fashion (AI generated image)

NEW DELHI: In a world where fast fashion reigns and the idea of repeating outfits is often met with disapproval, designer Rina Dhaka is championing a shift towards sustainability . Dhaka believes fashion doesn’t have to be disposable and that reusing clothes should be seen as stylish. “We need to make re-wearing outfits fashionable,” she urged.Speaking at an interactive session organised by FICCI-FLO on Tuesday, titled ""How to Be the Best Version of Yourself,"" Dhaka was one of seven panellists captivating the audience with her insights.What left the crowd particularly inspired was when she told them about the ‘ 30 Wears rule ’.The 30 Wears rule encourages consumers to ask themselves whether they would wear a particular piece of clothing at least 30 times before making a purchase. By doing so, it promotes more mindful shopping habits and helps reduce textile waste, advocating for a longer life cycle for each item of clothing. Dhaka's message was clear: sustainability and style can go hand in hand, and mindful fashion choices are the way forward.During the session, panelists touched on a variety of topics—from how improving posture can enhance one’s appearance to the importance of incorporating Indian textiles into everyday fashion.Another panelist, Nelofar Currimbhoy, daughter of beauty mogul Shahnaz Husain and a veteran of the industry, offered a fresh perspective on beauty, emphasising that it extends far beyond appearances. ""Beauty is a tool for cultivating self-worth,"" she shared, highlighting its deeper role in personal empowerment. ""It's not just women who are conscious of their looks—men are, too. But for women, dressing up can be an act of empowerment, a way to express confidence and strength.""Currimbhoy was quick to clarify, however, that beauty isn’t about spending hours in a salon. ""We’re not advocating that women should chase perfection with endless treatments. What matters most is authenticity.""Rina Dhaka echoed this sentiment, adding a modern-day twist. ""In an era where real faces are increasingly replaced by silicone, the focus should shift to grooming and hygiene, rather than chasing artificial ideals."" Dhaka’s words underscored the need for a return to simplicity—celebrating beauty that’s rooted in self-care and self-respect.For the session the panelists included fashion designers such as Leena Singh, Neenal Pratap Rudy, Rina Dhaka, and Nelofar Currimbhoy, Tanu Jain, Aditya Dhir from the jeweler industry, and Donna Masih, who is a Fashion Model and Fashion Lifestyle Influencer.Donna emphasised the powerful impact of good posture on enhancing one’s personality and presence. In today’s world, where we’re constantly glued to our phones, poor posture—especially a hunched neck—has become all too common. ""A strong posture speaks volumes,"" she explained. ""It’s essential for making a positive impression, particularly in first meetings or public interactions.""She went on to highlight how crucial first impressions can be, often setting the tone for success or failure. ""Your first impression can make or break a situation,"" Donna remarked. ""Sometimes, it’s not about what you say, but how you present yourself. Non-verbal cues, like posture, can make you seem approachable and open, encouraging others to engage in conversation."" Her advice was clear: standing tall not only boosts confidence but also opens doors to meaningful connections. The only male panelist among the group also gave some jewellery styling tips, saying now less is more.When an audience member at the event candidly asked for tips on how to look more camera-ready, the panelists eagerly offered their advice. Donna chimed in first, suggesting that side profiles and angled poses often work best on camera. ""A slight turn can make all the difference,"" she said, hinting at the magic of finding flattering angles.Nelofar Currimbhoy added her own expert tip, particularly for group photos. ""In a group shot, try stepping back from the others slightly,"" she advised. ""It creates a better perspective and can give you a more flattering angle in the frame."" Both panellists emphasised that small adjustments can dramatically improve how you present yourself on camera, making every shot count.As the session wrapped up, Leena and Rina treated the audience to live styling demonstrations, showing how a few layers and simple outfit choices can transform a look from ordinary to chic. Meanwhile, Donna took the stage to offer practical advice on perfecting body posture and enhancing overall presentation, reminding everyone that how you carry yourself is just as important as what you wear. Together, their demos provided a seamless blend of fashion and confidence tips, leaving the crowd inspired to elevate their style and presence.","FICCI-FLO held an interactive session on 'How to Be the Best Version of Yourself' Panelists included fashion designers Rina Dhaka, Neenal Pratap Rudy, Nelofar Currimbhoy, Tanu Jain and Aditya Dhir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113648549,imgsize-1518464,width-400,resizemode-4/113648549.jpg"
Why Diddy settled his $18.8 million mortgage before sex trial arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-diddy-settled-his-18-8-million-mortgage-before-sex-trial-arrest/articleshow/113637461.cms,"Anticipating a federal sex-trafficking indictment, the hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs settled the $18.8 million mortgage on his opulent $48.5 million Star Island mansion just before charges were brought against him.This strategic move, anticipating criminal proceedings, emerged during a recent bond hearing where prosecutors claimed Combs hosted ""Freak Offs""—wild, drug-infused parties involving female victims and male sex workers.Federal agents raided his Star Island estate in March, uncovering substances like drugs, baby oil, and lubricant, all reportedly used during these gatherings. Shortly after, a grand jury indicted him on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and illegal transportation for sexual activities, to which Combs pleaded not guilty.In an attempt to secure bail, Combs’ legal team, led by Marc Agnifilo, proposed a $50 million bond package, using the Star Island home as collateral and backed by six passports from Combs and his family to demonstrate that he wasn’t a flight risk. Despite this, the judge denied bail, citing concerns of potential violence, flight, or interference in the ongoing investigation.Combs’ decision to clear the mortgage was likely a tactic to leverage Florida's Homestead Act, a law that safeguards homeowners from losing the equity in their primary residence regardless of legal troubles. This same law allowed O.J. Simpson to retain his Florida home despite a $100 million judgment against him. By settling his mortgage, Combs ensured the protection of his main asset against any legal ramifications.The bond hearing shed light on Combs’ extravagant lifestyle. His Star Island mansion, purchased for $14.5 million in 2003, has since transformed into a sprawling 14,800-square-foot estate, complete with multiple pools, a spa, and cabana-style pool houses, now valued at $48.5 million.Combs cleared the mansion’s mortgage in August, in anticipation of legal complications. Although this was acknowledged as a poor business decision, it was a calculated effort to gain the court’s trust.Star Island, a 55-acre exclusive enclave inhabited by billionaires and celebrities, is no stranger to high-profile residents. Combs, who acquired another mansion next door for $35 million in 2021, chose only his primary residence for the bail proposal, which ultimately failed.Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, a prominent figure in the music and entertainment industry, also known by aliases like Puff Daddy and P. Diddy , faces serious allegations that could tarnish his legacy. Born in Harlem in 1969, Combs rose to fame as a music producer and entrepreneur in the 1990s, establishing Bad Boy Records and launching the careers of artists such as The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, and Mase. He later expanded into fashion with his Sean John clothing line, spirits through Ciroc Vodka, and media with REVOLT TV, amassing a multi-million dollar empire.Combs is now embroiled in a federal case that alleges involvement in "" freak-offs ,"" described as sexually charged gatherings held in luxury hotels. Prosecutors claim he engaged in coercive, abusive, and criminal sexual activities at these events. The indictment details charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, arson, bribery, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice. It describes these ""freak-offs"" as involving prostitutes, excessive drug use, and substantial amounts of baby oil, all recorded on video by Combs, who allegedly used the footage to maintain control over participants. Some individuals were reportedly so physically drained from these events that they required intravenous fluids to recover, with a clean-up crew later restoring the hotel rooms.Central to the case is Cassie Ventura , a singer and Combs' former girlfriend, who filed a civil lawsuit alleging years of abuse and forced participation in the ""freak-offs."" Her lawsuit detailed how Combs directed her to use excessive oil, engage with prostitutes, and filmed the encounters as ""personal art projects,"" even adjusting lighting for effect. Ventura settled her lawsuit a day after filing, but her claims prompted a broader investigation, encouraging others to come forward with similar allegations.These accusations coincide with heightened discussions on power, consent, and gender equality, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement. The case has provoked debates on how powerful figures exploit their influence and how society addresses allegations involving wealthy, high-profile individuals. Some politicians have used this case to advocate for stricter laws on sex trafficking and better support for survivors, while others stress the importance of accountability regardless of status or wealth.Combs' legal team denies all allegations, asserting that the ""freak-offs"" were consensual. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, claims interviews with men identified as sex workers in the indictment revealed no evidence of coercion. Nevertheless, the allegations have subjected Combs to intense public scrutiny, with many expressing disappointment in him, given his status as a cultural icon and social justice advocate. His business ventures have also felt the impact, with some partners distancing themselves.As the case progresses, it remains a significant topic in discussions about power dynamics, racial stereotyping, and the criminal justice system, especially amidst ongoing social and political debates.","Hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs cleared the mortgage on his $48.5 million Star Island mansion just before charges were brought against him.

She promptly relocated it back onto her property and disposed of it.However, three weeks later, she was startled by another visit from an enforcement officer who presented her with a £500 (Rs 55,571.20) fine for fly-tipping.""I got a knock on the door with a man with an enforcement camera on his chest, telling me he is filming me,"" she said.

She has received an outpouring of support from the local community, with one resident admitting to engaging in similar practices for years without realizing it constituted fly-tipping.Additionally, several local councillors have reached out to Pepin with messages of support.

"After a 'brat summer', Gen Z is celebrating a 'Strega Nona fall' this September",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/after-a-brat-summer-gen-z-is-celebrating-a-strega-nona-fall-this-september/articleshow/113644213.cms,"Kids' book-inspired coziness: A pasta-making witch from a 1975 kids’ fable is being hailed online as the blueprint for autumnal coziness

By the autumnal equinox Sunday, Danni Capalbo had already had her fall game plan in place for weeks. She would spend the coming months wrapped in cozy layers in her apartment in Boston, stirring up steaming vats of carbohydrates. Her inspiration for the season is a benevolent witch she met in the hills of Calabria, Italy, many years ago: Strega Nona , the title character of a 1975 children's book of the same name by Tomie dePaola .""She's so relatable,"" Capalbo, 28, said. ""She's a little Italian witch who makes pasta all the time."" She first encountered the character in her childhood library. But lately she has been seeing Strega Nona pop up on social media, recast by adults as a patron saint of autumnal nostalgia. She joined in by posting a tribute to the character that has been viewed over 300,000 times on TikTok. Other fans have enumerated the signs of a ""Strega Nona September,"" or joked that they were trading the chaos of "" brat summer "" for a more wholesome ""Strega Nona fall.""If these posts are an outgrowth of the online habit of branding every season, they also represent an enduring fascination with a character known for her quiet way of life and gently administered lessons - not exactly the typical recipe for internet fame. Strega Nona, whose name means ""Grandmother Witch"", is a healer who enchants townspeople with her magically refilling pasta pot. When she recruits the help of a young man named Big Anthony, he bungles the spell that is supposed to halt pasta-making. The town overflows with noodles. Margaret Duncan, 29, a healthcare worker in Boston, finds herself reaching for characters like Strega Nona every autumn, when her nostalgia swells with the back-to-school season. ""I think that there's a longing for simplicity,"" she said. ""Her biggest problem is that this young man who helps her made too much pasta."" Even that problem Strega Nona is able to solve: She hands Big Anthony a fork and tells him to start eating.The illustrations in the book, also by dePaola, feature the rich colours of the Italian countryside. Capalbo said the book conjured a certain snug atmosphere that was welcome as she hunkers down for colder weather. The character's witchiness, she added, is also a nice prelude to Halloween. ""Everyone has their big fun summer,"" she said. ""Now you just want to be cozy and make pasta from your magic pasta pot"".","Strega Nona is the title character of a 1975 children's book of the same name by Tomie dePaola.

The Solar Boat is approximately 4,600 years old, dating back to the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt.

The vessel measures 42 meters (138 feet) in length and weighs around 20 tons.

It was discovered in 1954 by Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh, located at the southern corner of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

The Solar Boat is considered one of the oldest and largest wooden ships ever found, representing advanced ancient Egyptian shipbuilding techniques.

It was believed that such boats were buried with pharaohs to aid them in their journey to the afterlife, reflecting the religious beliefs of the time.

The boat is made from high-quality cedar wood, showcasing the materials and craftsmanship of ancient Egyptian shipbuilders.

Extensive restoration efforts have been undertaken, guided by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities' chief restorer, Ahmed Youssef Moustafa.

The vessel was moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum using a remote-controlled vehicle within a protective metal cage, taking 48 hours for the operation.

The Grand Egyptian Museum, scheduled to open later this year, will feature the Solar Boat among over 100,000 artifacts from ancient Egypt.

The Solar Boat not only enhances our understanding of ancient maritime practices but also serves as a symbol of Egypt's rich cultural heritage and its fascination with the afterlife.

The ancient Solar Boat of King Khufu has recently been relocated from its long-time resting place near the Great Pyramid of Giza to the upcoming Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM). This 4,600-year-old vessel, known for being one of the oldest and largest wooden ships discovered, provides invaluable insights into ancient Egyptian civilization and its maritime practices.Discovered in 1954 by archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh, the boat was originally buried alongside the Great Pyramid, believed to aid the pharaoh in his journey to the afterlife.Officials from Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced that the boat's transport was meticulously planned to ensure its preservation for future generations. Weighing approximately 20 tons and measuring 42 meters (138 feet) in length, the vessel was moved over a 48-hour period using a specially designed remote-controlled vehicle, encased in a protective metal structure. This operation marks a significant step in safeguarding one of the world's oldest intact ships, a testament to the advanced shipbuilding techniques of ancient Egypt.","The Solar Boat is approximately 4,600 years old, dating back to the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt.

Suicide: 'I want to have some dignity': Terminally ill US woman plans assisted death in Switzerland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-want-to-have-some-dignity-terminally-ill-us-woman-plans-assisted-death-in-switzerland/articleshow/113609990.cms,"A terminally ill woman from Missouri, US is preparing to travel to Switzerland for a physician-assisted death . Gayle Hendrix has been battling lupus and interstitial lung disease for four years and says her lung capacity is steadily worsening, leaving her eager to maintain control over her final moments.“I’ve had a great life, and I want to have some dignity when I’m going to the next phase,” Hendrix told 12 KFVS.She plans to make the journey with her daughter, Charlene Foeste, and end her life on September 26.Hendrix led an active lifestyle filled with hiking and travel but now struggles to breathe and must rely on an oxygen machine. She explains that her decision to travel to Switzerland stems from not wanting to wait until she is no longer physically able to make the journey.“I don’t want to get to the point of, ‘This is existing, not living,’” she said.The 79-year-old's decision has sparked difficult conversations within her family. Her daughter, Charlene, admits she doesn’t agree with her mother’s choice but feels it’s not her place to interfere. “It’s not my choice. I do love her and support her,” Foeste said. “There’s no way on the planet my mum is going to do this alone, no way.”Physician-assisted death is legal in 10 US states and Washington DC, but Hendrix chose Switzerland due to restrictive US regulations , which require patients to have less than six months to live. Hendrix believes waiting until she’s closer to death would rob her of control. “I don’t want to wait that long,” she said. “I don’t want to get that sick.”Hendrix has long been an advocate for assisted suicide . Her journey to Switzerland was delayed due to a lack of available appointments, but the process was eventually set in motion.Although some of Hendrix’s friends and family disagree with her decision, she remains determined. “I just am peaceful about my decision, and it’s the right thing for me and my body,” she said, as per Fox News.","Gayle Hendrix, 79, has been battling lupus and interstitial lung disease for four years.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Earlier this year, he criticised Google’s autocomplete feature for “assassination attempt of” and “president donald” not showing Trump in the autocomplete predictions. He then said that Google had a “search ban” on Trump. Google responded by saying that “That’s not happening, and we want to set the record straight.”","Quiver Quantitative report suggests Google and Microsoft are the companies making major donations to the Kamala Harris/Joe Biden campaign.
