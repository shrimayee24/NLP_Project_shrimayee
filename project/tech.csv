Chef: ‘I’m a chef but my kid ate bhindi for a year. Parents shouldn’t take the child’s food choices personally’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/im-a-chef-but-my-kid-ate-bhindi-for-a-year-parents-shouldnt-take-the-childs-food-choices-personally/articleshow/114886636.cms,"Is your daughter a foodie like you?

Cooking is a survival skill, but few parents bother to teach their children to cook. Should this change?

Most moms find that feeding their kids is their biggest cause of stress in their lives. You often see moms chasing their kids with bites or handing the iPad at mealtime. How can parents make mealtimes stress-free?

How has motherhood changed you?

How do you deal with tantrums?

These days, a lot of parents are scared to give sweets as they fear their kids will have a ‘ sugar rush ’ and get hyper. How can parents satisfy their child’s sweet craving without giving unhealthy packaged items?

Is junk food banned for your daughter or are you cool with her indulging occasionally?

While some moms go out of their way to make smiley-shaped rotis and star-shaped sandwiches, others believe one should let the child skip a meal if he is being fussy. What’s your take?

Aloo paratha and khichdi used to be staple meals for kids. But these days, parents worry that their child may not be getting enough protein, vitamins or fibre if they eat these. How can we ensure the child gets all the macronutrients?



You are always cooking yummy food. How do you manage to stay in shape?

I think any working parent struggles with guilt. Would I rather be hanging out with my baby on the beach? Absolutely! But would I also like to be a role model for her so can achieve whatever she puts her mind to? Absolutely as well!Kids are great for an ego-check, especially if you are a chef . So yes, Zanskar is a foodie. She loves dark chocolate, Swiss cheese, khao suey and dimsum, but there are some things (like sushi) that she absolutely will not try.Parents most definitely need to teach their kids how to cook. I joke with my mom that I had never entered the kitchen till I went to Le Cordon Bleu, Paris. I feel in India because of large families and lots of domestic help, we don’t know basic survival hacks. On the other hand, Chris (Christophe Perrin, her husband and co-founder of Gaia Gourmet) grew up in the Swiss Alps and he has been cooking for himself since he was 10.We all want little gourmands eating with chopsticks by the tender age of ten months. But that’s a very unattainable goal. Kids are unpredictable. Zanskar ate only fried bhindi and chapati for a year. Did I take it personally? Of course, I did. I’m a chef. But that was not wise. I think parents should not take it personally if the child does not eat what they have prepared. It is your job to offer food at the right time and according to your schedule, and it is the baby’s job to figure out how much and what she wants to eat.I also think we should remember that our house is not a restaurant. Give kids variety but not unlimited choices at meals. If your child does not like her meal, give her a familiar, safe alternative or a glass of milk and try with the next meal. Also, it is not good to bribe, distract or threaten though I must admit I am guilty of all three. But not often. Force-feeding is also a bad idea. It disregards the child’s satiation point. Let them learn to follow those internal commands of when to stop. Eating a meal together is a generous, fun, collective act. Include the child in the fun, from shopping to cooking. You never know, they might surprise you by polishing off the meal.For me, it’s been an inspiring, humbling, endlessly entertaining, learning journey. I truly believe we choose our kids and they choose us.I make Zanu punch a pillow. These days she walks away, sits on a chair on her balcony and looks at nature, saying it calms her. I’m very impressed.A lot of packaged healthy food out there tastes like cardboard. I think the question is not sugar vs no sugar. It’s refined vs natural, it’s processed vs homemade and packaged vs fresh. I talk a lot about where your food comes from. A homemade ragi chocolate chip cookie (see recipe) is a very different creature from a packaged biscuit. No harm in eating sweet treats that are made at home using fresh ingredients and without preservatives.I wish I had that much power to ban stuff. She has very good taste in junk. She loves chips, hates lollipops and only likes dark chocolate. She is lucky because we make loads of fun, healthy snacks at home, even gummy bears. And we buy snacks only after reading the ingredients and knowing where they come from.Getting your kid excited about food is great whether it’s interesting shapes or fun colours (eat the rainbow!). I do believe in packaging the food in kid-friendly forms. But yes, forcing a kid to eat usually won’t work anyway and will only result in a lot of stress for the parent and child.This is exactly why I wrote ‘ Baby Knows Best ’. I wanted it to be a bridge between our traditions and modern nutrition. I make a lot of parathas, but I upgrade the recipes using gluten-free flours and millets with fillings such as ABC (apple, beetroot, carrot, chia) and moringa pea paneer. We also don’t need to stick to the basic dal and rice khichdi. We can make khichdi with different millets and add a variety of root veggies and gourds.Let’s clarify this once and for all. You can eat yummy food and still be in shape and be healthy. It is your food choices and lack of exercise and probably laziness that is the reason you are not in shape.",Parents most definitely need to teach their kids how to cook. Zanskar ate only fried bhindi and chapati for a year.

How to get your CIBIL Credit score without a PAN Card

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109067339,imgsize-51000,width-400,resizemode-4/109067339.jpg"

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

​How this Okta security flaw exposed accounts with long usernames,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-okta-security-flaw-exposed-accounts-with-long-usernames/articleshow/114893747.cms,"Take a look a the post here



How this security flaw can be a serious concern



Okta , has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass password authentication under specific conditions. In its latest security advisory sent to its users, the identity and access management provider noted that the vulnerability affected accounts with usernames of 52 characters or more and required the presence of a stored cache key from a previous successful login. However, to access them without passwords, the account's owner had to have previous history of logging in using that browser. This notice was also shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter).This flaw, which was introduced in a July update, was discovered and fixed last month by the company. Okta also assured users that organisations requiring multi-factor authentication were not affected.A Forbes report cited the company which said: ““A precondition for this vulnerability is that the username must be or exceed 52 characters any time a cache key is generated for the user.”However, a 52-character username is easier to guess than a random password. It can be someone’s email address, containing their full name and their organisation’s domain. Its also important to note that suchlong usernames are also rare.This vulnerability also highlights a potential security risk for accounts with long usernames and a history of logins from the same browser. Okta has recommended users who meet these conditions to review their access logs for any unauthorised activity.Okta offers software that simplifies adding authentication services to apps for companies to provide a unified login experience across multiple apps. This saves end-users from the need to verify their identities separately for each one.The company hasn’t stated whether it knows of anyone affected by this particular issue but has earlier promised to ""communicate more rapidly with customers"" after the Lapsus$ threat group accessed a few user accounts.","Okta has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass password authentication under specific conditions.

Tony Fadell , former Apple executive and creator of the iPod , defended Apple's cautious approach to artificial intelligence . Speaking at the 2024 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Fadell acknowledged the not-so-overwhelming first impressions but emphasised the strategy's long-term benefits.""People were like, 'I downloaded it,' and they were like, 'Apple's AI is meh,'"" Fadell said.

Cook attributed this surge to strong interest in Apple Intelligence features.The company plans to release additional AI capabilities in December, initially in US English before expanding to the UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand.

"Intel rolling back this ‘major’ chip design, CEO Pat Gelsinger says “..not a good way to run the business…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-rolling-back-this-major-chip-design-ceo-pat-gelsinger-says-not-a-good-way-to-run-the-business/articleshow/114880595.cms,"Why Intel is rolling back to older ways

So, as that shift occurred, obviously, this became a bigger margin implication, both for Lunar Lake and for the company overall. But we were very pleased to have the option to scale Lunar Lake and higher volume because of the momentum energy around the AIPC category. That said, a volume product and a volume industry like the

PC industry

, you don't want to have volume memory going through that channel. It's not a good way to run the business.

So, it really is, for us, a one-off with Lunar Lake. That will not be the case with Panther Lake, Nova Lake and its successors as well. We'll build it in a more traditional way with memory off-package and the CPU, GPU, NPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off-package in the road map going forward.

And we won't have this kind of impact that we're dealing with for '25 in the margin structure, specifically around Lunar Lake. But again, it's a great product and we're happy that we have it in the portfolio, and we've scaled it commensurate with the enthusiasm of the AIPC category.

Intel is reversing a major design decision in its laptop chips, CEO Pat Gelsinger has said. The change will come in the form of abandoning the on-package memory approach introduced with its Lunar Lake processors.During the earnings call, the company executives said that the Lunar Lake chip has the memory in the package that affects the gross margins. Gelsinger said that going-forward upcoming chips will have memory sticks .This announcement comes as a surprise as it had previously touted the benefits of on-package memory, particularly its potential to improve battery life in laptops by reducing power consumption associated with data transfer.Intel said that the change reduces the power consumption of moving data through the system by approximately 40%.","Intel is reversing a major design decision in its laptop chips, CEO Pat Gelsinger has said.

Apple planning to buy Intel: What and why of rumours of Apple acquiring the 56-year-old chipmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-planning-to-buy-intel-what-and-why-of-rumours-of-apple-acquiring-the-56-year-old-chipmaker/articleshow/114861241.cms,"Why Apple may acquire Intel

A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel. As to how this Apple planning to buy Intel rumour started? They come from the tech YouTube channel 'Moore's Law is Dead', where Tom S. reported ""whispers"" of a potential purchase of Intel by Apple. He, at the same time, also claimed that Samsung too is interested in acquiring or merging with the chip manufacturer Intel.While this idea may seem utterly absurd to many, it would certainly be a dramatic twist in the long-running saga of the PC industry.Back in 2019, Apple did acquire Intel's modem division, but this new rumour proposes a full-scale takeover of the entire chipmaker. While Samsung is also mentioned as a potential buyer, it's Apple's involvement that piques the most interest, and perhaps a touch of amusement.Once a dominant force in the PC industry, Intel's fortunes have waned in recent years. The company has faced numerous challenges, from manufacturing delays to declining market share. Despite repeated promises of groundbreaking new processors, Intel has struggled to regain its former glory.Meanwhile, Apple has successfully transitioned away from Intel's chips, developing its own powerful Apple Silicon processors. These chips have consistently outperformed Intel's offerings, solidifying Apple's position in the tech industry. If Apple acquires Intel, the iPhone maker could free itself from an overreliance on TSMC for chips.Also, please note that the Youtuber Tom reiterates several times in the video that these are all rumours, and it's not clear if any purchase of Intel is actually in the works.","A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel.
