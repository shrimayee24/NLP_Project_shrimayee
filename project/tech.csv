Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, and gaining a lot of attention, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox. Fans are, therefore, speculating, it is just a hoax, like all the other times before. So, until any confirmation is received, one can relax and continue playing their favorite on the platform.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, news about Roblox being shut down has spread and repeatedly, those were denied. The claims of Roblox shutdown were called rumors, and a hoax.The platform gave reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true. Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe, Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the player-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens. Whether or not it is true, only time would tell.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

Gisele Bündchen accused of erasing Tom Brady’s son Jack from her life and focusing on her new family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-accused-of-erasing-tom-bradys-son-jack-from-her-life-and-focusing-on-her-new-family/articleshow/123477917.cms,"Gisele Bündchen (Getty Images)

Not every family milestone plays out on social media: privacy and new priorities

What this says about blended families, step-parent roles and growing up in the spotlight

Tom Brady’s recent tribute to his eldest son, Jack, drew warm reactions online — and also shone a light on the different ways blended families handle big moments. Brady filled his feed with praise and photos as Jack turned 18, writing that his heart was ""overflowing with happiness and pride. "" But Gisele Bündchen, Brady’s ex-wife and a longtime stepmother figure, didn’t post a public birthday message, instead sharing family shots focused on her younger children and new partner. That contrast set off chatter — and it’s worth unpacking beyond the headline.Public figures often navigate competing pressures: celebrate openly to fans or protect private family life. Gisele’s choice to highlight her younger children and recent personal moments suggests a conscious boundary.She posted photos of Benny and Vivi and moments with Joaquim Valente, which coincided with Jack’s birthday timeline. For many parents — celebrities included — shifting priorities after a divorce can mean reframing whose milestones are celebrated publicly.Jack, born in 2007, has grown up partly in public and partly out of it. Brady’s visible celebration underscores his role as an involved father; Bündchen’s quieter presence may reflect respect for Jack’s independence as he becomes an adult, or simply her focus on her immediate household.Either way, the episode highlights a broader point: social media silence isn’t always a slight — sometimes it’s a deliberate choice to protect relationships and boundaries. Fans and commentators should be cautious before reading too much into a single Instagram gap.Also Read: “Give up my dream because…”: Gisele Bündchen slams the media and reveals the truth behind split with Tom Brady At the end of the day, Jack’s 18th birthday is a personal milestone.

"Visa fraud: Indian-origin Rambhai Patel sentenced to 20 months in jail, deportation for organizing fake burglary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/visa-fraud-indian-origin-rambhai-patel-sentenced-to-20-months-jail-deportation-for-organizing-fake-burglary/articleshow/123462340.cms,"Indian-origin man Rambhai Patel sentenced for visa fraud.

What is U-visa?







Indian-origin New York man Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to. His prison sentence is followed by two years of supervised release and forfeiture of $850,000. After that, Patel is subject to deportation.Beginning in March 2023, Patel and his co-conspirator Balwinder Singh set up and carried out staged armed robberies of at least 18 convenience or liquor stores and fast-food restaurants across the United States, including at least five in Massachusetts. The purpose of the staged robberies was to allow the store clerks to claim that they were victims of a violent crime on an application for U nonimmigrant status (U visa). A U visa is available to victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and who have been helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.During the staged robberies, the “robber” would threaten store clerks and/or owners with an apparent firearm before taking cash from the register and fleeing, while the interaction was captured on store surveillance video.The clerks and/or owners would then wait five or more minutes until the “robber” had escaped before calling police to report the “crime.” The “victims” paid Patel to participate in the scheme. One purported victim paid $20,000 to participate as a victim in one of the staged armed robberies. In turn, Patel paid the store owners for the use of their stores for the staged robbery. Patel earned approximately $850,000 in the scheme, all of which he is required to forfeit as part of his sentence.At least two purported victim co-conspirators submitted U Visa applications based on being victims of the staged armed robberies.The U visa is a type of non-immigrant visa in the United States created to protect victims of certain serious crimes who have suffered significant physical or mental abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. It was designed to encourage undocumented victims to come forward without fear of deportation, thereby strengthening public safety. To qualify, the crime must fall under specific categories such as domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, kidnapping, or similar offenses, and the victim must provide helpful information to authorities. The U visa grants legal status in the US for up to four years, along with work authorization, and after three years, holders may apply for a green card. Family members, including spouses, children, and in some cases parents or siblings, may also benefit through derivative visas, making the program a vital form of protection and relief for vulnerable victims of crime.","Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to.

“She doesn’t include Blake”: Taylor Swift leans on Travis Kelce’s support and no longer values Blake Lively’s advice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/she-doesnt-include-blake-taylor-swift-leans-on-travis-kelces-support-and-no-longer-values-blake-livelys-advice/articleshow/123467910.cms,"Taylor Swift - Blake Lively (Getty Images)

Why Taylor’s private listening parties matter more than just early reactions

Taylor Swift credits Travis Kelce for boosting her confidence and bold new image

Taylor Swift’s album rollout for The Life of a Showgirl is already shaping up to be as much about relationships as it is about new music. After announcing the record on Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce’s “New Heights” podcast, Swift has reportedly staged intimate listening sessions for a handful of close friends — and those invites are telling. Sources say some familiar faces are at the front of the room while others, like Blake Lively , are noticeably absent.Carefully curated preview events are a modern marketing tool: they create buzz, craft narratives, and seed early endorsements. According to one insider, “Selena Gomez has heard it. Zoë Kravitz too.” Public praise from those names carries weight — Zoë even said in an interview, “I’ve heard bits of it. It’s fantastic… No skips.” Those endorsements turn private plays into viral talking points, amplifying anticipation ahead of the October 3 release.Excluding a longtime friend from these gatherings is bound to spur speculation. “It’s raised eyebrows,” the source observed, and the situation has fans and media dissecting what it means for the singer’s social dynamics. “Taylor is testing the waters with the people she trusts most.” The insider bluntly summed up the stakes: “If you’re in that room, you’re in her heart. Right now, that doesn’t include Blake.” Whether this reflects scheduling, shifting alliances, or strategic PR, Swift’s selections send clear signals about who she wants publicly aligned with this new era.Taylor Swift is reportedly embracing a bolder persona for her upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl, thanks to the confidence instilled by her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce. A source told the Daily Mail, “Travis treats her with so much dignity and respect, and it has allowed her to explore a sexier side of herself safely.” While the singer experiments with a more daring style, the insider emphasized it won’t be “too explicit. ”Also Read: Taylor Swift’s secretive feature film leaves fans guessing — and why Travis Kelce won’t be in it Swift’s evolution reflects both personal growth and her comfort with Kelce, allowing fans to “follow her through all parts of her personality.” The album drops October 3.","Taylor Swift has reportedly staged intimate listening parties for a handful of close friends.

NHL Trade Rumors: Vancouver Canucks push for middle-six center as trade market heats up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-vancouver-canucks-push-for-middle-six-center-as-trade-market-heats-up/articleshow/123467931.cms,"Vancouver Canucks (Ben Nelms/CP)

Canucks exploring beyond free agents after cooling interest in Jack Roslovic

Jesperi Kotkaniemi and Pavel Zacha stand out as possible solutions



With training camp fast approaching, the Vancouver Canucks are once again at the center of trade buzz. The organization has made its intentions clear: they want to bolster depth down the middle, and that pursuit could mean a significant move before the season begins.According to The Athletic’s Thomas Drance, the Canucks have shifted their focus away from the free-agent pool. While Jack Roslovic was once on their radar, management no longer sees him as a long-term fix. Instead, Vancouver is exploring the trade market, searching for a center who can play meaningful middle-six minutes while complementing their offensive core.The Canucks reportedly made an aggressive push at the NHL Draft, offering the 15th overall pick for Minnesota Wild forward Marco Rossi. That deal fell through when the Wild decided to keep Rossi, signing him to a bridge contract. With few appealing free-agent options remaining, Vancouver is now turning to players who could be available via trade.Two names continue to circulate around Vancouver’s rumor mill: Jesperi Kotkaniemi of the Carolina Hurricanes and Pavel Zacha of the Boston Bruins. Kotkaniemi, still just 25, carries an affordable $4.82 million cap hit and has shown flashes of offensive upside, though he has yet to fully meet expectations from being drafted third overall in 2018.Many believe a change of scenery could finally unlock his potential.Zacha, meanwhile, represents a more polished option. With multiple 20-goal seasons and experience centering Boston’s top line, he offers proven production. At 28 and entering his prime, he would cost the Canucks more in terms of trade assets, but his ceiling may be exactly what Vancouver needs.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Toronto Maple Leafs linked to shocking Erik Karlsson deal with Penguins As the Canucks prepare for camp, Filip Chytil and Aatu Raty are projected to handle center duties.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain dropped a request for Apple to create a tool to give law enforcement access to customers' cloud data.

Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything?

Every year, as the brutal summer heat begins to wane, eyes across the Arabian Peninsula turn skyward in anticipation of a celestial sign: Suhail. This year, with temperatures soaring to 50 degrees Celsius, the star’s rise is awaited with even greater urgency. Known in Western astronomy as Canopus (α Carinae), Suhail has guided Arab calendars, agriculture, and folklore for centuries. Its annual appearance marks the seasonal shift to cooler nights, stirring cultural, environmental, and poetic associations across generations.Suhail is the Arabic name for the star Canopus, scientifically designated as α Carinae. It is located approximately 310 light-years from Earth and is part of the Carina constellation in the southern sky. With a luminosity more than 10,000 times that of the sun and a mass around eight times greater, Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, surpassed only by Sirius.This brilliant, yellow-white giant becomes visible before dawn, typically 30 to 50 minutes before sunrise, rising low on the southeastern horizon. For optimal visibility, observers are advised to find a dark, elevated area away from artificial light, especially in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula.Suhail’s brilliance is not just astronomical but deeply cultural. Historically, it served as a navigational aid, particularly for Arab sailors and desert travelers, earning it the status of a celestial compass and seasonal clock.The appearance of Suhail is seasonal and gradual, progressing from south to north across the Arabian Peninsula:: First visible in Jazan, a southern region of Saudi Arabia : Reaches the central parts of Saudi Arabia.: Becomes visible in the northern regions of the Kingdom.This timing can slightly vary based on geographic location, but August 24 is widely recognized as the key date for Suhail's emergence in most of the Arabian Peninsula.The Suhail season spans 52 days, marking a transition period where daytime remains warm, but nighttime temperatures begin to cool. By the end of the season, typically aligning with the autumnal equinox on September 23, even daytime heat becomes more manageable, with temperatures stabilizing around 30°C in many regions, especially as October's rainy season approaches.For Arabs, Suhail has long served as a seasonal milestone. Its appearance marks more than just a shift in climate, it signals changes in daily life, agriculture, and social rhythms.Suhail indicates the time to begin camel grazing, date harvesting, and palm tree pollination, typically 70 to 80 days after its appearance. Fishermen, pearl divers, and farmers have traditionally synchronized their activities with the star’s rise.Arab astronomers historically used Suhail to track other stars and as a reference point in the night sky. Its significance extends beyond mere utility, it became part of their classification and naming systems for celestial bodies.Suhail has inspired countless lines of Arabic poetry and proverbs, often associated with relief, abundance, and the promise of change.The star was a reliable navigation tool for early Arabs, especially sailors and travelers, guiding journeys across land and sea.Suhail holds a profound place in Arab cultural heritage, celebrated for both its visual beauty and symbolic resonance. It’s a frequent subject in Bedouin sayings, folk wisdom, and classical Arabic poetry.Classical poet Abu Al-Ala Al-Maari once wrote:“Suhail is like the cheek of love in color... and the heart of the lover in palpitations,”reflecting the star's vivid color changes- red, yellow, and green, and its emotional symbolism.“If Suhail appears, do not be afraid of a flood”This suggests the star’s appearance may precede seasonal rainfalls and possible flooding, urging awareness of natural changes.“If Suhail rises, the night will be pleasant”A reflection of how Suhail marks cooler, more comfortable nights after the oppressive summer.“When Suhail rises, you can feel the dates at night”A seasonal marker for the ripening of dates, vital for both nutrition and trade in the region.","Suhail is the Arabic name for the star Canopus, scientifically designated as α Carinae.

Sharjah has welcomed a significant new addition to its architectural and religious landscape with the opening of the Quran Mosque in Aljada. Designed with both scale and simplicity in mind, the mosque reflects the emirate’s commitment to Islamic values, community well-being, and modern spiritual infrastructure.On the afternoon of August 21, 2025, H.H. Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah and Chairman of Arada, officially inaugurated the Quran Mosque in the Aljada district. Following the opening ceremony, Sheikh Sultan led worshippers in the Dhuhr (midday) prayer, marking the mosque’s spiritual debut.The inauguration was attended by a number of high-level officials and dignitaries, including:Spanning 6,388 square metres, the Quran Mosque is one of the largest mosques in Sharjah and the first to be established in the Aljada community. Its design is notable for the absence of interior columns, creating an open and uninterrupted prayer space — a rare architectural feature that enhances both visibility and serenity.Key architectural and spatial features include:The mosque is topped with a circular central dome and a 39-metre-high minaret, blending minimalism with traditional Islamic aesthetics. The exterior is enhanced by elegant Arabic calligraphy, merging simplicity with visual sophistication.Beyond its architectural elegance, the Quran Mosque incorporates thoughtful facilities designed to support spiritual and communal life. These include:These features aim to create a welcoming and functional environment for both daily prayer and deeper spiritual engagement, serving both residents of Aljada and visitors to the area.During the opening, religious scholar Salem Al Doubi delivered a speech highlighting the mosque’s importance as a gathering place for worship and moral upliftment. He spoke on the spiritual rewards of building mosques and their role in promoting peace and unity among the faithful, describing them as ""houses of God"" with a central place in Islamic life.The Quran Mosque is not a standalone project. It marks the first of several mosques planned by Arada to meet the growing needs of the Aljada community. Two additional mosques are in development, forming part of a broader effort aligned with Sharjah’s long-term vision to expand access to places of worship across the emirate.","Sharjah has welcomed a significant new addition to its architectural and religious landscape with the opening of the Quran Mosque in Aljada.

In a defining moment at Expo 2025 Osaka, the UAE Pavilion has recorded over three million visitors since opening in April, solidifying its status as one of the most admired and frequently visited national pavilions at the global event.The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three-million visitor threshold — a milestone that reflects its broad international appeal, immersive experiences, and the compelling narrative it offers under the theme “Earth to Ether.”Opening its doors in mid-April 2025, the Pavilion has since established itself as a hub of dialogue, innovation, and cultural exchange. Visitors from around the world have been drawn to its engaging displays, sustainable architecture, and human-centric programming — all designed to reflect the UAE’s deep-rooted heritage and its ambitions for a globally inclusive and technologically progressive future.This landmark was marked on August 21st by a celebration on-site. The Pavilion team — including its Youth Ambassadors — welcomed guests with their hallmark hospitality, creating a moment of shared reflection and connection. These Youth Ambassadors have played an integral role in shaping the Pavilion experience, facilitating storytelling, encouraging cultural conversations, and leaving a meaningful impression on the millions of visitors who’ve walked through the Pavilion’s doors.Behind the Pavilion’s unique identity is its design, crafted by the Earth to Ether Design Collective — a collaboration of architects and creatives from the UAE, Japan, and other global partners. The structure is built with 90 architectural columns, inspired by the form and resilience of the date palm, and constructed using agricultural palm waste. This design not only pays homage to the UAE’s natural heritage but also embodies sustainable principles and an ethos of shared global progress.Inside, the Pavilion invites visitors on a journey across five thematic zones. Each space is thoughtfully curated to highlight key areas where the UAE is making bold strides, including:Interactive installations, sensory-driven storytelling, and a clear narrative flow allow visitors to explore these themes in a deeply engaging, memorable way.Beyond its architectural and thematic appeal, the UAE Pavilion has grown into a daily cultural destination within Expo 2025. Its dynamic programming includes:These daily activities draw both casual visitors and dedicated Expo participants, many of whom return for second or even third visits — a strong indicator of the Pavilion’s emotional and cultural impact.A notable highlight is the Pavilion’s food program. At the heart of it is Japan’s first-ever Emirati restaurant, located within the Pavilion, which has already attracted over 100,000 visitors. Traditional dishes such as lamb ouzi, loqaimat (sweet dumplings), and a signature drink made from camel milk, rehash, and toasted pistachio have offered Japanese and international guests a taste of Emirati hospitality and culinary tradition.In addition, summer culinary workshops for children and families have proven especially popular, with young Japanese participants learning the art of pastry-making under the guidance of Emirati chefs. These sessions not only share flavours but stories — offering a chance for participants to connect with Emirati culture through personal and sensory experiences.Commenting on the milestone, Shihab Alfaheem, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the UAE to Japan and Commissioner General of the UAE Pavilion, reflected on the significance of the Pavilion’s impact:“Reaching the three million mark is a huge milestone for the UAE Pavilion. It is a cherished achievement, and speaks to the global resonance of the UAE’s story and our shared aspirations for the future. Every visitor who walks through the Pavilion brings their own voice to our collective journey. Together, we are shaping a narrative that crosses borders, embraces diversity, and accelerates progress. With two months remaining, we want more guests to experience our pavilion. ”With Expo 2025 running until October 13, the Pavilion remains open and active — continuing to welcome visitors with the same warmth, curiosity, and openness that has defined its success so far.","The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three- million visitor threshold.

In a significant anti-narcotics operation, Abu Dhabi Police, in collaboration with the National Drug Control Service, have seized 377 kilograms of crystal meth and arrested three individuals. The suspects, Asian nationals, had attempted to conceal the drugs inside oil cans intended for sewing machines, deploying what authorities described as a ""sophisticated"" smuggling method. The bust not only highlights the vigilance of local law enforcement but also underscores the role of public reporting tools like the Aman Service in combating crime.Abu Dhabi Police announced the successful dismantling of a drug smuggling operation involving three Asian nationals who were found in possession of a large quantity of crystal methamphetamine, weighing a total of 377 kilograms. The operation was executed in coordination with the National Drug Control Service, reflecting a joint effort to target and eliminate narcotics trafficking in the region.According to Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Criminal Security Sector, the gang employed an unconventional concealment method by hiding the crystal meth inside oil cans manufactured for sewing machines.Authorities noted that this attempt to bypass detection systems demonstrated a high level of planning and ingenuity.However, the operation was foiled thanks to what Brig. Al Dhaheri described as the ""expertise and vigilance"" of the anti-narcotics teams. He emphasized that their ability to detect and intercept such a well-disguised cargo speaks to the strength of the emirate’s ongoing counter-narcotics strategy, which is supported by Abu Dhabi’s leadership and aligned with the national drug control agenda.After their arrest, the suspects were referred to the competent authority for legal proceedings.Alongside details of the bust, Abu Dhabi Police issued a strong public advisory warning residents not to fall prey to the common misconception that drug use leads to happiness or comfort. Brig. Al Dhaheri highlighted the serious negative effects of drug abuse, particularly its toll on personal health and public safety.Police reiterated that drugs, regardless of how they are presented or marketed by traffickers, carry grave health risks and contribute to broader social harm. They urged all community members to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity involving narcotics or related crimes.To support these efforts, the police pointed to the Aman Service, Abu Dhabi’s official platform for reporting cybercrimes and other serious offenses. Established in 2009, the Aman Service allows the public to confidentially share information related to security, cybercrimes, traffic incidents, and community threats.The service operates 24/7, year-round, and is not intended for filing police reports but specifically for providing intelligence or information that may help authorities prevent or investigate crimes.The Aman call centre supports Arabic, English, and Urdu, ensuring access for a wide range of residents. Authorities guarantee complete confidentiality for all individuals using the service to report criminal or suspicious activities.Residents are encouraged to use Aman to report incidents such as unauthorized access to personal accounts, blackmail, privacy violations, or the distribution of malicious content.","Gang hid 377kg of crystal meth inside oil cans made specifically for sewing machines, using them to bypass security detectors.

Poll Should AI responses from public figures be clearly labeled as AI-generated? Yes No





Mark Sewards, a British MP for Leeds South West and Morley, has launched an AI version of himself that responds to public complaints using his own voice.He introduced the digital assistant, ""AI Mark"", through his official X account. ""This prototype AI model offers my constituents an additional way to engage with their MP on local casework and policy issues. It can't replace the other work I do – it simply gives people another option to contact me, any time of day,"" Sewards wrote.Encouraging residents to try the tool, he added, ""I encourage any resident of Leeds South West and Morley to give AI Mark a try. This is only a prototype, and every request will help train it and make it better.""The AI responds with supportive messages or offers to forward queries to Sewards' team. While the aim is to make it easier for voters to feel heard by a voice that sounds like their MP, a disclaimer on the website reads:“AI Mark is a prototype digital assistant – this is a work in progress and not everything it says should be taken as fact. All responses are AI-generated.”The chatbot has attracted both interest and criticism from AI experts and the media.The Guardian reported that it struggled with accents, failing to recognise messages from people living just a few kilometres from the constituency’s border.Dr Oman from the University of Sheffield told BBC that the growing use of AI in public services poses challenges, especially for older people. “Many don’t realise they’re speaking to a bot and assume it’s a real person.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities. I remain committed to giving law enforcement the resources they need to take down these gangs and protect the public.""",A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring.

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

To ensure continued access to pension benefits, annual life certificate submissions are mandatory for all pensioners. This process, which verifies the pensioner's living status, has been streamlined through various online and offline methods. With the recent initiatives to promote digital submissions, pensioners can conveniently fulfil this requirement and maintain their financial support.The requirement for pensioners to submit their jeevan pramaan patra is a critical process in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of pension funds. By providing multiple submission methods—both online and offline—the government is making it easier for pensioners to comply with this requirement. The ongoing digital campaigns further illustrate the government’s commitment to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of pension services, ensuring that pensioners receive their benefits without unnecessary delays.The submission window for life certificates opened on November 1 for pensioners under the age of 80. This is part of an annual cycle during which pensioners must reaffirm their eligibility for pension disbursement. The deadline for submitting the life certificate is November 30. If the certificate is not submitted by this deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting in December. This requirement also applies to super senior citizens (aged 80 and above), who were allowed to submit their certificates starting on October 1, with the same November 30 deadline.Pensioners can submit their life certificates through several methods, accommodating various preferences and technological capabilities. Here are the options available:For those choosing to submit their life certificates online through the Jeevan Pramaan Portal, the following steps are involved:For pensioners opting for offline submission, the process is straightforward:If pensioners fail to submit their life certificates by the stipulated deadline, their pension payments will be halted starting the following month. However, payments will resume once the life certificate is submitted, thereby ensuring that pensioners do not permanently lose access to their funds, provided they complete the required process.In an effort to facilitate the submission process, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) has initiated its third nationwide digital life certificate (DLC) campaign. This campaign runs from November 1 to November 30, covering 800 cities and districts. The campaign aims to promote the use of digital platforms for certificate submission, ensuring greater accessibility for pensioners.On the first day of this campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners successfully generated their digital life certificates, highlighting the growing adoption of technology among pensioners. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization and the effective use of biometric authentication methods.A life certificate is an official document that verifies a pensioner's living status, required annually to continue receiving pension benefits.All pensioners, including family pensioners, must submit a life certificate to maintain their pension payments.Pensioners under 80 must submit their life certificate between November 1 and November 30 each year. Super senior citizens (80 and above) can submit theirs starting from October 1, with the same deadline.If the life certificate is not submitted by the deadline, pension payments will be suspended starting the following month.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online via the Jeevan Pramaan portal, through doorstep banking agents, using biometric devices at post offices, or in person at bank branches.Pensioners can submit their life certificates online by using the Jeevan Pramaan portal and completing biometric verification through designated apps.Yes, pensioners can submit their life certificates in person at their respective banks or post offices.Generally, you will need your Aadhaar number for biometric verification, along with any other identification or pension-related documents as required by your pension disbursing authority.Pensioners can check the status of their life certificate submission through the Jeevan Pramaan portal or by contacting their bank or pension disbursing authority.Yes, if your submission fails, you can reapply and submit your life certificate again using the same methods available to you.",Submission window for 'Jeevan Pramaan Patra' opens for pensioners under 80 with a deadline of November 30. Pensioners can opt to have a bank agent visit them at home to facilitate the submission of their life certificate. This method is particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114942014,imgsize-53514,width-400,resizemode-4/114942014.jpg"
"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.
