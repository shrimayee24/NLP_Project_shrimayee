The arrival of an exceptionally large newborn often sparks both medical attention and public fascination. Shelby Martin, a first-time mother from Nashville, Tennessee, recently captured worldwide interest after giving birth to her son, Cassian, weighing an astounding 12 pounds, 14 ounces (5.8 kg). His birth not only set a new record at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital but also went viral online, with thousands reacting in disbelief and humour. Cassian’s extraordinary size highlights the natural variation in human births while underscoring the strength and resilience required of mothers during delivery. Despite the challenges associated with delivering a jumbo baby, both Shelby and her son are thriving, demonstrating the remarkable combination of maternal endurance and expert medical care that makes such births possible.Shelby Martin shared her pregnancy journey on TikTok, showcasing an unusually large baby bump. Her humour and candid commentary struck a chord, quickly amassing over 4.4 million likes and tens of thousands of comments. In the video, she quipped, “When people talk about having a big baby… trust me, I know big,” giving viewers a glimpse of the size of her unborn son before birth, while also sharing tips on coping with physical strain, cravings, and the emotional ups and downs of late-stage pregnancy.Social media users responded with disbelief and humour, with comments jokingly asking how long the baby had been inside or suggesting creative ways he might have been delivered. The viral moment highlights how extraordinary pregnancies can captivate public attention, especially when coupled with light-hearted commentary, relatability, and genuine, everyday parenting experiences that resonate widely online.As reported by The New York Post, Cassian, Shelby’s newborn son, weighed a staggering 12 pounds, 14 ounces at birth via C-section. This size is remarkable, as the average newborn in the United States weighs approximately 7 pounds, according to Stanford Children’s Health. Cassian’s birth marks the largest at TriStar Centennial Women’s Hospital in more than three years, leaving both doctors and nurses in awe of his size and overall health.Despite his impressive size, Cassian required only a brief stay in the NICU for monitoring. He received IV fluids, oxygen support, and glucose monitoring to ensure stable health in his first critical days. Doctors acted quickly to prevent complications, and Shelby expressed her gratitude to the medical team, highlighting the importance of professional care and support during complex deliveries.Babies born with exceptionally high birth weights—commonly referred to as macrosomic or “jumbo” babies—pose unique challenges during delivery. Mothers may require C-sections to safely deliver infants over 10 pounds due to increased risks of complications, such as prolonged labour, perineal tears, and shoulder dystocia. NICU monitoring for glucose levels, oxygen, and feeding is often necessary to ensure the newborn’s smooth transition after birth.These precautions underscore the importance of skilled obstetric and neonatal care, particularly in cases of extreme birth weights. Shelby’s experience demonstrates that, with proper medical support, both mother and child can thrive, even in extraordinary circumstances.Cassian is not the first oversized newborn to make national news. In Florida, Daniella Hines delivered her son Annan at 13 pounds, 15 ounces in early September, while in Alabama, Pamela Mann welcomed her daughter Paris Halo weighing 13 pounds, 4 ounces in March. These births show that, while rare, jumbo babies occur across the country, often inspiring social media fascination and local media coverage as reported.For comparison, a typical newborn weighs between 6 and 8 pounds, meaning these infants are nearly double the size of average babies. Their births offer both medical intrigue and a reminder of the wide spectrum of normal human development.Extraordinarily large babies often bring a mixture of awe, humour, and practical challenges. Families celebrate the milestone, while medical teams carefully manage delivery risks. Social media reactions—from playful jokes to expressions of amazement—highlight the fascination these births inspire globally.Babies weighing over 9 pounds, 15 ounces at birth are generally classified as macrosomic. While genetics and maternal health play key roles, factors like maternal diabetes or prolonged pregnancies can contribute to higher birth weights. Careful prenatal monitoring, preparation for potential C-section deliveries, and NICU readiness are crucial for safe outcomes.","Shelby Martin shared her pregnancy journey on TikTok, showcasing an unusually large baby bump.

Elon Musk’s xAI studio aims to create innovative AI-generated video games



Experts warn AI content creation cannot match human creativity and vision



Musk’s Grok aims for AI movies while raising copyright and ethical concerns

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine 0.9 boosts AI video, text, and image creation.

"Arm CEO Rene Haas is 'sorry' for Intel; says: Unfortunately, Intel has ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/arm-ceo-rene-haas-sees-sorry-for-intel-says-unfortunately-intel-has-/articleshow/124399073.cms,"Arm CEO Rene Haas. Image credit: YouTube

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Poll Do you see a significant cultural divide affecting the semiconductor industry in the US versus Taiwan? Yes, it's a major factor No, it's overstated

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”

Residents in several parts of the UAE are being advised to brace for rainy weather, lower temperatures, and dusty winds between Friday, October 10, and Tuesday, October 14, as a shifting weather system moves through the region, primarily affecting the northern and eastern areas.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast a period of unstable weather conditions starting Friday, October 10, through Tuesday, October 14, due to the influence of an extended surface low-pressure system from the south and an upper-level low carrying relatively cold and humid air. These upper-level low-pressure systems tend to intensify with altitude and are typically linked with cloud development and rainfall.During this five-day stretch, weather models indicate that areas most likely to experience rain include Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain, while major coastal cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to remain largely dry. The Windy app projects the rain will begin on Sunday. Forecasts describe the expected rainfall as light to moderate overall, with some areas experiencing heavy rain intermittently. This weather activity is expected to affect primarily the northern and eastern regions, with the potential to extend inland and toward some western areas.There is also a limited chance of hailstones forming in certain locations.In addition to rain, a noticeable drop in temperatures is expected across affected regions. Windy conditions may intensify at times, potentially kicking up dust and sand. These conditions may reduce visibility in some areas and could affect outdoor plans, especially during the weekend. Sea conditions are also likely to be impacted, with wave activity in both the Arabian Gulf and the Oman Sea ranging from slight to moderate, occasionally becoming rough.September and October are typically among the most humid months of the year in the UAE, with humidity sometimes reaching 100 percent. However, this year has seen relatively drier conditions leading up to this weather shift. With forecasts predicting a cooler, wetter period, residents and travelers are advised to monitor updates and plan accordingly.","From October 10-14, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Al Ain are expected to experience light to moderate rain and dust.

Egypt’s Karnak temple was built on a primeval island

Unveiling Egypt’s river secrets

A new chapter in Karnak’s history





For centuries, the vast Karnak Temple complex near Luxor has stood as one of ancient Egypt’s most enduring mysteries. Now, new research has revealed astonishing secrets hidden deep beneath its foundations. A geoarchaeological study published in Antiquity in October 2025 has uncovered evidence that the temple was originally built on a natural river island more than 3,000 years ago. Led by Dr. Angus Graham of Uppsala University and Dr. Ben Pennington of the University of Southampton, the study used 61 sediment cores and tens of thousands of pottery fragments to reconstruct the temple’s ancient landscape, revealing a sacred island that shaped Egypt’s religious and architectural evolution.The study found that around 2520 BCE, shifts in Nile River channels created a raised island about 500 metres east of the modern Nile. This island later became the foundation of Karnak Temple. Ancient Egyptians saw this “primeval mound” as a symbol of creation, mirroring their myth of the sun god Ra (or Amun-Ra) rising from the primordial waters. The temple’s location, therefore, was not accidental but a deliberate choice reflecting powerful religious beliefs about cosmic rebirth and divine emergence.Over centuries, natural river movements and deliberate human interventions shaped Karnak’s environment. The Nile carved new channels around the sacred island, while ancient engineers expanded the site by filling waterways with desert sands and sediments to make room for temple construction. This blending of geology and ingenuity turned the area into one of the grandest religious centres of the ancient world, aligning architecture with celestial and environmental symbolism.By analysing sediment layers and pottery distribution, researchers traced how the Nile’s floodplain evolved alongside Egypt’s civilisation. The findings reveal that temple construction began much earlier than previously believed, dating to the Old Kingdom period (2591–2152 BCE). These results also show how environmental change directly influenced urban planning and religious architecture, offering the first measurable evidence of how Egyptians transformed a dynamic river landscape into sacred land.The Karnak revelations come amid a surge of major finds across Egypt. Archaeologists recently unearthed three 3,000-year-old tombs near Dra Abu el-Naga, dating to the New Kingdom period. Meanwhile, underground tunnel systems at Taposiris Magna have renewed interest in Cleopatra’s final resting place, and submerged harbour sites are shedding light on Egypt’s maritime and funerary traditions. Collectively, these discoveries are reshaping our understanding of how the Nile’s shifting geography influenced Egyptian religion, burial practices, and power.The study marks a breakthrough in Egyptology, demonstrating how modern science can illuminate the hidden geological and mythological layers of ancient monuments. The discovery of the sacred island beneath Karnak reframes the temple not merely as a structure of devotion, but as a living reflection of Egypt’s relationship with the Nile and the cosmos. As excavations continue, researchers believe further secrets lie buried under Luxor’s sands, waiting to rewrite the story of Egypt’s sacred beginnings.","Karnak Temple was originally built on a natural river island more than 3,000 years ago.

Riyadh metro fines list

Eating or drinking on the train: SAR 100. Avoid food or drinks inside carriages.



Smoking or vaping onboard: SAR 200. Smoking is strictly banned inside vehicles and many station areas.



Strong odours / perishable food or bulky unapproved items: SAR 200. Keep smelly foods and large items out of carriages.



Travelling without a valid ticket / fare evasion: SAR 200 + applicable fare (inspectors can add the fine on top of the fare). Validate your ticket.



Putting feet on seats / occupying priority seats without reason: SAR 200. Courtesy rules protect seats for others.



Bringing non-foldable scooters, bikes, skateboards (not permitted): SAR 200. Pushable strollers and mobility aids are allowed.



Sleeping in prohibited areas / disturbing passengers or staff (loud phone calls, blocking doors): SAR 200. Keep noise and obstruction to a minimum.



Dangerous behaviour (sticking body out windows, hanging off exterior): SAR 300. This is classed as a safety risk.



Vandalism, tampering with equipment or unauthorized access: SAR 500 (and higher for serious damage). Deliberate damage carries much harsher penalties. Major infrastructure misuse or repeat/dangerous offences: fines scale steeply up to tens/hundreds of thousands of SAR — and repeat offenders may face penalties up to SR10 million and possible imprisonment in the most extreme cases. (These are handled under rail/transport law to protect critical infrastructure.)



How fines are enforced, paid and — if needed — appealed

Ask staff for the violation slip and keep any proof (ticket, photo, time). RPT has customer care contacts for queries.



Pay online via national portals — many government fines can be paid through Saudi platforms such as My.gov.sa / Sadad / Efaa or the specific payment method listed on the fine. (Check the violation notice for payment instructions.

If a fine is a traffic-style government violation it may also appear on national e-services.

What it means for daily commuters — quick, common-sense tips to stay fine-free

Always validate your Darb card or digital ticket before boarding. The ticket system is linked to fine enforcement.



Don’t eat, drink or smoke on trains. Enjoy snacks at stations or before/after journeys. SAR100–200 is easily avoidable.



Keep feet off seats and respect priority seats. It’s cheap to follow and the fine is real.



Fold or avoid bringing big wheeled devices (non-foldable scooters/bikes are not permitted). Use permitted luggage zones



If you see damage or safety hazards, report it to station staff or RPT hotlines reporting helps protect the system and may spare you liability if you were unaware.







Riyadh Public Transport has published a set of new rules and fines for users of the Riyadh Metro to keep trains clean, safe and on time. Most everyday slips (eating, feet on seats, fare evasion) carry modest penalties — SAR100–SAR200 — while deliberate damage or major safety violations can trigger very large fines and even criminal charges. Read on for the exact penalty list, how fines are enforced, where to pay or appeal, and simple common-sense tips to keep you fine-free.Here are the penalties commuters are likely to encounter — the short version you can memorize:Why two different ranges appear in the press: short, everyday fines (SAR100–500) are set to manage passenger behavior; a separate regulatory framework sets much larger penalties for sabotage, infrastructure damage or repeat, serious offences.Riyadh Public Transport (RPT) enforces the rules using station staff, onboard inspectors and CCTV; fines may be issued on the spot or registered via the system and tied to your ticket or card. For commuters this means: validate your ticket, follow signage, and keep a receipt if you are issued a notice.If you do get a notice:Riyadh’s new rules mostly target nuisance behavior and real safety threats. For the average rider a few small habits prevent trouble:For everyday Riyadh riders the message is simple: these fines are designed to keep rides clean and safe most penalties are small but enforceable. The expensive, high-end penalties are aimed at protecting transport infrastructure and public safety, don’t test those.

If you’re in Dubai this October, get ready to catch one of the city’s biggest Diwali celebrations yet. Fireworks will be lighting up the skies at key spots, alongside a range of cultural events. It’s a perfect chance to experience how Dubai blends tradition and celebration for the Festival of Lights.Running from October 17 to 25, Dubai’s expanded Diwali fireworks celebrations will light up iconic locations like Al Seef and Global Village.

This year’s fireworks schedule includes five major shows across two venues.The festivities kick off on October 17 with a stunning opening display at Al Seef. Located along the banks of Dubai Creek, this historic waterfront destination offers a unique Diwali experience, pairing views of traditional wooden dhows and restored souks with modern cafés and boutiques.Organisers recommend arriving early — the show is free to attend, but expect large crowds drawn to the charming, old-world setting.The celebration continues at Global Village, which hosts four additional shows over two weekends. Each display begins at 9:00 PM, adding sparkle to the venue’s festive ambience as families and tourists pour in for the Diwali weekend.From October 17 to 19, Al Seef also hosts the ‘Noor: Festival of Lights’, a cultural showcase organised by Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE) under the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), in collaboration with the Indian Consulate in Dubai and Teamwork Arts.Far more than just a fireworks event, Noor transforms Al Seef into a cultural crossroads, celebrating India's rich artistic heritage through:The festival begins at 6:00 PM on October 17, inviting families, residents, and tourists to dive into a multisensory journey of India’s performing arts.

Hasan Piker collargate: Twitch Streamer denies shock collar use after dog's viral yelp. Netizens ain’t buying it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hasan-piker-collargate-twitch-streamer-denies-shock-collar-use-after-dogs-viral-yelp-netizens-aint-buying-it/articleshow/124428362.cms,"



Prominent Twitch streamer Hasan Piker has found himself at the centre of a growing controversy after a clip from his October 7 livestream went viral, showing his dog Kaya yelping as he scolded her for moving out of the camera frame.The moment has triggered widespread accusations of animal cruelty, with viewers alleging that Piker used a shock collar to keep the dog in place during broadcasts.Piker, who has over 3 million followers on Twitch, has denied the claims, stating that the collar Kaya wears is a vibration-only training collar with an AirTag attached. He claimed that Kaya let out the yelp after catching her dewclaw on the edge of her bed, not due to any electric stimulation.However, sceptics online remain unconvinced. Some users zoomed in on the livestream clip and pointed to what they claim was a green blinking light on the collar - suggesting it could be an electric shock device. They also resurfaced an older clip in which Piker once described a shock collar as “incredibly effective.”A now-viral post on X read: “Shock collaring that innocent dog for no reason just cause he wants to walk around? That’s not a prop for your stream background, that’s a living being.You’re a sick f***.”Another post said, “Wild how the most good faith interpretation of the Hasan thing is that he didn't really use a shock collar on his dog, he just got weirdly angry at his dog for briefly stepping off of the little square he makes her sit on for 4+ hours while he livestreams.”Adding fuel to the controversy, a clip was widely circulated in which Piker is heard saying: “I don’t give a s*** if the dog is in pain and can’t breathe, it’s a dog.”Critics claim this undermines his defence and raises questions about his care for the animal.Some users have even called for official action. One user posted the number for LA’s department of animal Services, saying, “Is he shocking that dog to keep it on screen? This dude’s a f***ing psycho... I’m calling in the morning. You should too. (888) 452-7381.”The backlash has also drawn comments from other prominent streamers like xQc and Tectone, who expressed concern over the viral clip. Meanwhile, people for the ethical treatment of animals (PETA) issued a statement:“Hasan Piker has denied using a shock collar on his dog, and we hope that’s true because shock collars are dangerous and downright cruel. They put dogs at risk of burn wounds, chronic anxiety, and displaced aggression. Positive reinforcement is a far more effective training method and doesn’t betray our animal companions’ trust in us,” reported The Hollywood Reporter.According to Grok’s summary of social media reaction, posts on the controversy have generated over 3 million engagements, indicating a deeply polarised response from Piker’s audience and the wider streaming community.","Prominent Twitch streamer Hasan Piker has found himself at the centre of a growing controversy.

Enter your beneficiary ID, password, and captcha, then click 'Sign In.' To create and link your ABHA ID, hover your mouse over the 'Update' menu and click on ""Create/Link ABHA ID."" If you're creating an ABHA ID for family members, ensure each family member is mapped after the main cardholder logs in through the ""Beneficiary login."" Select ""I don’t have an ABHA number."" Enter your Aadhaar number, review the terms and conditions, and provide your consent. In the subsequent step, input the OTP sent to your mobile number registered with Aadhaar and click 'Verify OTP.' You'll see the 'Link Status' option. If the details match, you can print the ABHA card by selecting 'print ABHA card.'

If you already have an ABHA number, follow these steps to link it with your CGHS beneficiary ID:

Log in to the CGHS website using your beneficiary ID and password, following the same process as mentioned above until Step 4. After Step 4, click on the 'Link Using ABHA Number' option and enter your ABHA number. Review the consent collection form carefully and provide your consent.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again turned his fire on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , accusing the company of betraying its founding mission and exploiting its non-profit status to profit. In a scathing post on X, the world’s richest man writes: “OpenAI is built on a lie”, adding “They stole a charity and used it for their own financial gain”. Musk was replying to a post by an X user named Helen Toner who shared:“Every so often, OpenAI employees ask me how I see the co now.It's always tough to give a simple answer. Some things they're doing, eg on CoT monitoring or building out system cards, are great.But the dishonesty & intimidation tactics in their policy work are really not. E.g:”Elon Musk’s sharp remarks against OpenAI comes as multiple users on X reported to have received subpoena from OpenAI in Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, demanding all documents related to its governance and investors, served at his Oklahoma home shortly after organizing an open letter on AI transparency.In another post, Musk accused the company of using “dirty tricks” to intimidate AI policy advocates, specifically referencing a sheriff's deputy serving a personal subpoena to nonprofit lawyer Nathan Calvin amid California's SB 53 debates.The incident ties into OpenAI's lawsuit against Elon Musk, where subpoenas sought evidence of his funding critics like Calvin's group Encode, though no such links exist, escalating public scrutiny on AI corporate tactics.Notably, this is not the first time that Elon Musk has criticized OpenAI. Musk has publicly labelled OpenAI CEO as ‘SCAM Altman’. He has consistently argued that this shift compromises OpenAI's original mission, turning it into a ""closed-source de facto subsidiary"" of Microsoft and prioritizing profit over public good. He has even filed lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging breach of contract and that the company has strayed from its initial non-profit commitment.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again turned his fire on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

""We are probably the world's most active users of Slack internally at OpenAI and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while.”

“We use kind of all the canonical SaaS systems you can think of. These are really important systems for OpenAI, and I think they're going to be really enduring and important systems for a while,”

How AI will improve among Slack and other traditional tools



“live in the cracks”

“But one of the things that we're able to do is actually use AI systems to basically help live in the cracks between, kind of what the user needs to be able to do with those systems, and kind of what those systems represent in terms of a workflow. So if you're a salesperson, for example, and you're trying to prepare for a meeting, right, there are a lot of factors that aggregate into how you think about preparation for that client and that customer.

Historically, you've had to go collect all those yourself. You've had to synthesise all the takeaways. You've had to kind of run the analysis, pull the data to write the profile, and hand that off to the other person who needs the context. All that now can be condensed, and so we built a lot of tooling around that for us to be able to actually make our sales teams much more productive and much more efficient and so and we hold everyone to that bar.

So the way we kind of look at this is there's a team whose job it is to think about how to actually drive output, drive impact in our organisation, so that when we have a salesperson join the team, or a marketer or a software engineer or whoever it is, they really are starting at a higher baseline level of productivity, and they can start to think more along the lines of, ‘hey, you know, instead of managing five or 10 accounts, maybe you can manage 20 accounts, Right? And that's just incredible leverage in our business.”

OpenAI divides its computing power internally into five categories: ""compute per researcher,"" ""computes per project,"" ""computing per project"" and ""comp compute per researcher""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124455078,imgsize-857397,width-400,resizemode-4/president-greg-brockman-describes-as-exercise-in-39pain-and-suffering39-inside-chatgpt-maker-openai.jpg"

How AI can be exploited







Eric Schmidt, who led Google as chief executive from 2001 to 2011, has delivered a ‘dangerous’ assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) security risks while simultaneously expressing optimism about the technology's transformative potential. Speaking at the Sifted Summit during a fireside chat this week, Schmidt addressed concerns about whether AI poses dangers comparable to nuclear weapons, acknowledging significant vulnerabilities in current AI systems.""Is there a possibility of a proliferation problem in AI? Absolutely,"" Schmidt stated, highlighting concerns that the technology could fall into the hands of malicious actors who could repurpose and misuse it.Schmidt pointed to evidence that AI models, whether closed or open-source, can be compromised to bypass their built-in safety mechanisms.“There’s evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails. So in the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone,” Schmidt highlighted.He noted that while all major AI companies implement safeguards to prevent their models from answering dangerous questions—a decision he characterised as both well-executed and ethically sound—these protections are not foolproof.""All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons. There's evidence that they can be reverse-engineered, and there are many other examples of that nature,"" Schmidt said.AI systems face multiple forms of attack, with prompt injections and jailbreaking among the most concerning methods, according to the former Google CEO.In prompt injection attacks, hackers embed malicious instructions within user inputs or external data sources such as web pages or documents. These hidden commands trick the AI into performing unintended actions, including sharing private information or executing harmful commands.Schmidt expressed concern about the lack of effective safeguards to address AI's proliferation risks.""There isn't a good 'non-proliferation regime' yet to help curb the dangers of AI,"" he stated, suggesting that current regulatory frameworks are insufficient to manage the technology's potential misuse.Despite these warnings, Schmidt struck an optimistic tone about AI's broader impact and argued that the technology is actually underestimated rather than overhyped.","Eric Schmidt, who led Google as chief executive from 2001 to 2011, has delivered a ‘dangerous’ assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) security risks.
