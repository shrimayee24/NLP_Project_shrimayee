The colourful design, created by Pune-based artist Rohan Dahotre , features a series of animals representing various regions of India, intricately woven into the letters of 'GOOGLE' to resemble a lively 'wildlife parade'. Among the highlights are a snow leopard dressed in traditional Ladakhi attire, a tiger sporting a dhoti-kurta while playing a musical instrument, a peacock in flight, and an antelope carrying a ceremonial staff.The doodle was designed to commemorate an event that stands as a symbol of unity and patriotism across the nation. As per the description on Google's website, the doodle captures the essence of Republic Day, an occasion that brings the country together in a spirit of pride and celebration. Dahotre, reflecting on India's vast diversity, stated, ""Republic Day holds great significance for India, as it unites people across the nation and ignites a sense of patriotism in every Indian.""Republic Day 2025 holds particular significance as the country celebrates 75 years of its Constitution's enactment, marking a momentous milestone in India's history. The event will feature a grand military parade on Kartavya Path, with President Droupadi Murmu leading the nation in the celebrations. The parade will showcase a mix of India's military might, cultural vibrancy, and achievements, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto attending as the chief guest. The 90-minute procession will include 16 tableaux from various states and Union Territories, as well as performances from armed forces contingents.This year’s Republic Day also places a strong emphasis on the theme 'Shashakt aur Surakshit Bharat' (Empowered and Secure India). Among the impressive displays is a Tri-services tableau, illustrating joint operations in land, air, and sea with indigenous defence equipment like the Arjun Main Battle Tank, Tejas MKII fighter aircraft, and the INS Visakhapatnam destroyer. There will also be tributes to the resilience and dedication of India's veterans, as well as representations of Nari Shakti, with women officers from all three services taking part.The ceremonial proceedings will include a fly-past by 40 aircraft and helicopters from the Indian Air Force , as well as a special motorcycle display by the Corps of Signals, famously known as 'The Dare Devils'. These breathtaking stunts, along with the concluding vertical manoeuvre by a Rafale fighter jet, will cap off a day of celebrations that honour the achievements of the nation and its people.","The doodle was designed to commemorate an event that stands as a symbol of unity and patriotism across the nation.

Fans called out the Mets for letting go of Pete Alonso

""Talks between Pete Alonso and the Blue Jays are 'advancing,' per a source with knowledge. Not done yet and no guarantee that it gets there,” Martino wrote.

""#firestearns @StevenACohen2 if y’all let Pete walk over a few million dollars your promises will have meant nothing, and this season is a waste of lindors prime and @JuanSoto25_ should request a trade immediately due to broken promises.""

""Noooo Pete don’t do this…""

""Would be odd for the Mets to spend so much time selling Juan Soto on the idea of ""family"" and then turn around and let a homegrown guy walk for the promise of next year's big free agent.""

""lmao have fun being irrelevant in toronto big man.""

""I think that if the Mets really wanted Pete something would have gotten done already. It seems like Stearns wants more Athletic guys..""

""Having to come back for a lesser offer than he turned down is a tough one. that's another reason why I don't think he will sign with Mets bc of his ego. The idea of him coming back to NY for a lot less and to face the media after is a devastating hit to that ego.""

With just a few weeks left for the offseason to end, multiple reports have been arising, highlighting the Toronto Blue Jays ' interest in signing Pete Alonso . In fact, the contract discussions between the two are ""advancing."" While the Blue Jays fans would be happy to have Alonso, many fans aren't happy with the New York Mets for letting the first baseman go.On Thursday, MLB analyst Andy Martino took to his X account to share a viral Tweet in which he claimed that the contract talks between the Toronto Blue Jays and Pete Alonso have been ""advancing."" Thus, there's a good chance that the Blue Jays might end up signing Alonso.However, this report didn't land well with many Mets fans. Fans came forward to share their reaction, as they called out the Mets for their low efforts at retaining Pete Alonso. One fan stated that the Mets would be wasting Juan Soto by letting off Alonso and wrote:Another Mets fan, dramatically asking Pete Alonso not to go with the Blue Jays, wrote:Then there was a fan who highlighted that it wouldn't make sense for the Mets to let go of Pete Alonso, considering how they have been selling Juan Soto through the idea of being a ""family."" Sharing his take on the same, the Mets fan said:A fan called out Pete Alonso, claiming that he would be ""irrelevant"" in the Blue Jays, as much relevant as he was in the Mets. Sharing his reaction, the fan tweeted:There was also a fan who pointed out the fact that the Mets have given up on Pete Alonso. Talking about how the team would have done something about his signing if they wanted to, the fans expressed:Another fan highlighted that it would be a ""tough"" decision for Pete Alonso to get back to the Mets, considering that he has already rejected a major offer from them. Talking about the same, the fan wrote:Before calling out the Mets for letting Pete Alonso go to the Blue Jays, a famous sports critic lashed out at Steve Cohen for his least efforts to hire back the first baseman.","The Toronto Blue Jays are reportedly in contract talks with Pete Alonso.

“Here you don’t have that,” - Bengals Ring of Honor Boomer Esiason taunts Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers

Aaron Glenn has been in the NFL books for far too long. He was with the No. 1 seed, Detroit Lions, for four long years as a defensive coordinator. The head coach there, Dan Campbell, even vouched for his vigor, saying, “He’s as good a coach as you’re going to find…he’s an even better human being. Look, if nobody wants him, I’ll take him again - I can tell you that right now. The thought of 'going through another cycle and he’s not somebody’s head coach' is ridiculous.”.So many people are cheery with this switch from DC of Detroit Lions to HC of New York Jets . Yet, there’s always a fish out of water. And that fish is, the former NFL MVP and quarterback for Cincinnati Bengals, 63-year-old Boomer Esiason . He is down in the dumps about the Jets going for Aaron Glenn as the head coach. Let’s understand his plight.At the Morning Show with Boomer & Gio, the four-time Pro Bowl quarterback, Esiason, talks about the Jets’ hiring Aaron Glenn,“Even though he’s a very popular defensive coordinator, a very popular personality within the Jets community, we’re going down the same road once again, they continue to go down, and they’ve not had an ounce of success at all.”Ever since quarterback Aaron Rodgers joined the Jets in 2023, the success rate has been down. In 2023, it was 7 wins and 10 losses; in 2024, it was 5 wins and 12 losses.Boomer roared at the show saying, “They’ve thrown money at every aspect of the team they possibly can, including quarterback, general manager, head coach. They’ve spent so much money on so many players over the last 12 years and they still can’t get it right.”The New York Jets have spent $112.5 million on their quarterback Aaron Rodgers, $5 million annually on their head coach, Robert Saleh, and $18 million on their general manager, Joe Douglas.Craig Carton, the co-host of Boomer & Gio, added his take on the New York Jets’ move to hire Aaron Glenn. He said,“They went from Todd Bowles, defensive coordinator first-time head coach to Robert Saleh, defensive coordinator first-time head coach, now Aaron Glenn, defensive coordinator to first-time head coach. Three in a row!”Boomer replied,“We’re not advocates for a newbie to come in here and take this thing over. When I’m saying that Aaron can’t do it, we’re certainly, I’m rooting for him like hell. I just wish he would get it.”On the Morning Show, Boomer shared that he’s rooting for Aaron Glenn like hell. But Glenn should have chosen Jacksonville Jaguars to coach. Because they have a quarterback there ‘who can still play’.Esiason is referring to the 25-year-old Trevor Lawrence, the quarterback for the Jaguars. Boomer continued his plight, “Here you don’t have that.”.

Google revamps mobile search URLs for a sleeker appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-revamps-mobile-search-urls-for-a-sleeker-appearance/articleshow/117569233.cms,"Google has announced a major update to its mobile search results, aimed at simplifying the appearance of URLs for a more user-friendly experience. This redesign focuses on presenting a cleaner and more streamlined look, enhancing readability and usability on mobile devices.Like all organising efforts, this one came with its challenges. “Rethinking the visual design for something like Search is really complex,” Aileen says.“That’s especially true given how much Google Search has evolved. We’re not just organising the web’s information, but all the world’s information,” Aileen says. “We started with organising web pages, but now there’s so much diversity in the types of content and information we have to help make sense of.”Previously, Google's mobile search results often displayed long, complex URLs that could be challenging to parse quickly. This change involves removing the breadcrumb element from mobile search results, which frequently got cut off on smaller screens. Instead, Google will now show only the most critical parts of the URL, such as the domain name and a simplified path.Google explained that this update is designed to make it easier for users to understand where a link will take them without unnecessary clutter. The company emphasised that this change will apply to all languages and regions where Google Search is available on mobile. Meanwhile, the breadcrumb element will still be present on desktop search results.“We hope this change makes it easier for people to find what they're looking for when they're searching on mobile,” a Google representative mentioned in a blog post.

Platforms and prices

US entrepreneurs are seizing an unusual opportunity to cash in on TikTok ’s temporary unavailability by selling phones preloaded with the app for hefty prices, some even exceeding $50,000 on platforms like eBay and Facebook Marketplace .However, it remains unclear whether buyers are willing to pay such extravagant sums.Short video content platform TikTok, which was temporarily inaccessible to US users over the weekend, is no longer available for download from Apple’s App Store or Google Play.However, those who already have the app installed can still use it, leaving individuals without prior access unable to join the platform.Many sellers are eyeing this as an opportunity, selling devices, pre loaded with TikTok and other ByteDance apps, such as Lemon8 and CapCut.On Friday, eBay listings ranged from $340 to $50,000, with more moderate priced options receiving the most attention.Nicholas Matthews, a seller from New York, listed an iPhone 14 Plus preloaded with TikTok for $10,000. Speaking on Friday, he revealed that his highest bid so far was $4,550.""I’m just expecting to sell this one phone,"" news agency AP cited Matthews.At present, TikTok has a massive user base of around 170 million users in the US, and the ongoing ban does not bar existing users from accessing the app.Earlier this week, former President Donald Trump directed the US justice department to delay enforcing them until early April.The future of this app remains at edge for now with uncertainties surrounding whether ByteDance, its China-based parent company, would agree to sell it.","TikTok is no longer available for download from Apple’s App Store or Google Play.

"$3,000 for a used iPhone? In US, if it has TikTok, maybe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/3000-for-a-used-iphone-in-us-if-it-has-tiktok-maybe/articleshow/117539517.cms,"For about $1,000, you may leave an Apple store with a brand-new, hermetically sealed iPhone that has been personalised for you by a verified Genius. Or, for hundreds or even thousands of dollars more, you can buy a used phone with a cracked screen and dirt-filled speakers, from someone on the internet. It just depends on how much you love TikTok.When the app stopped working in the US on Saturday after Supreme Court backed a law that effectively banned it, some users deleted the app from their phones. The next day, the app started working again when President Trump said he was planning an executive order to pause enforcement of the law. But, as of Thursday, Apple and Google, which had removed TikTok from their app stores to comply with the law, had not made it available again.The uncertainty about whether the app will return to app stores has caused some people who never removed the app to view their phones like golden tickets, coveted by anyone who misses thumbing through TikTok's algorithm or had followings they can't reach after they hastily removed the app.It was not immediately clear how many people deleted TikTok and whether it will return to app stores. But people such as Piotr Gustab, 37, are seeing opportunity in the uncertainty. Gustab listed his iPhone 15 Pro with TikTok downloaded onto it for $3,000 on Facebook Marketplace. That's about three times the cost of a brand-new iPhone 16 Pro. On Thursday, he had an offer for $1,200, still more than almost every brand-new iPhone and nearly twice as much as a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro without TikTok.""UNLOCKED WITH TIKTOK,"" an ad on Poshmark reads ($3,500). ""iPhone 14 Pro UNLOCKED! W/ TikTok,"" a listing on eBay calls out ($3,000). On Facebook Marketplace, sellers include screen recordings to verify that TikTok is installed on the phone. ""This app is worth a lot,"" said Izell Malloy, 20. He said he was offered $5,700 on Facebook Marketplace for his iPhone with TikTok on it.Perhaps iPhone listings asking for $30,000 are not realistic. Even users going through the most severe TikTok withdrawals would be hard-pressed to buy a used phone for the price of a 2025 Toyota Prius. There are safer options. TikTok is still accessible on web browsers, and users on Reddit say they have found a workaround to download the app. If TikTok goes dark again, the app is ""just a piece of art."" But art, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. To someone, the renegade and pop-culture memes may be worth a few months' rent.","TikTok stopped working in the US on Saturday after Supreme Court backed a law that effectively banned it.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

The most expensive S series smartphone from Samsung continues the trend of refined aesthetics with a squared-off titanium frame and Gorilla Glass Armor 2. The Gorilla Glass Armor 2 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is scratch resistant and it also provides anti-reflective glass ceramic cover the the smartphone. The design is both durable and elegant, with a slimmer and lighter build compared to its predecessors. The phone now features smoother, rounded corners, making it more comfortable to hold.

The display on the smartphone offers a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The screen is protected with a coating of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass which makes it resistant to scratches. We really liked the display on the flagship Samsung smartphone. It offers a crisp resolution, smooth 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and enhanced Vision Booster for vivid outdoor viewing. Samsung has further enhanced brightness levels, making it easy to view even under harsh sunlight. The colour accuracy and HDR performance ensure vibrant visuals, whether you're gaming or streaming videos.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is powered by Android’s most powerful and advanced chipset – Snapdragon 8 Elite.

The smartphone also supports Qi wireless charging. Samsung claims that the smartphone can charge from 0to 65% in just 30 minutes. However, we are yet to test this functionality and the battery backup of the smartphone. The dual SIM smartphone comes equipped with an in- display fingerprint sensor and sports a quad rear camera setup.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra runs Android 15 operating system topped with the company's own layer of One UI 7. Samsung has also confirmed that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will get seven years of OS and security updates.

The AI features of the OS come with a significant new look, based on a new notification system that streamlines communication with easy access from the device's lock screen. It includes Now Bar, which highlights relevant activities across various features like Interpreter, Music, Recording, Stopwatch and more.

We will talk more about the software in our detailed review of the smartphone.Same as its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra also sports a quad rear camera setup. The rear camera consists of 200MP main camera with f/1.7 aperture, 50MP ultra wide sensor with f/1.9 aperture, 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and f/2.4 aperture and 50MP periscope telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom and f/3.4 aperture.

The primary sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra manages to capture incredible detail and dynamic range. The AI enhancements bring sharper portraits and more accurate colour reproduction. Features like depth-of-field control and Galaxy Log enhance creative possibilities and help users do much more with the camera. Also, the redesigned camera UX allows more intuitive control over advanced settings.

The Gadgets Now Awards 2024 witnessed a gathering of leading technological minds who assembled to perform a comprehensive review of the year's most impressive digital innovations. This distinguished panel, composed of influential figures in the technology industry, conducted a thorough examination of the current state of technological advancement.A key member of this esteemed jury was CP Gurnani , the co-founder and executive vice chairman of AIonOS.Gurnani, a visionary leader in the field of technological innovation, offered invaluable strategic insights during the evaluation process. While participating in the jury meeting, Gurnani expressed his admiration for the remarkable innovation demonstrated by the showcased products, noting that selecting a winner from such a competitive pool proved to be a challenging endeavor.“You know, on one end, I would say.. an amazing product range. Clearly when it came to innovation in design, innovation in features, innovation led by AI, and the power of the chipsets. It was really a difficult task to choose the winner,” Gurnani told the Times of India-Gadgets Now team.Gurnani expressed a desire for even more ambitious and impactful innovation, particularly in the area of environmental sustainability.“But you know, there's always this “dil mange more” moment. And I would have been happy if it was a green innovation contest. For me, the dream would be, ‘every gadget that we ever sell or supply in Delhi, should come in with those miniaturised air purifiers. If you can convert a watch into a phone; And if you can convert a phone into a TV studio. I don't see a reason why we cannot dream big and think of features, which are more software-driven, more electronics-driven and can be miniaturised,” he added.Gurnani analysed the innovation seen in different gadget categories, highlighting both progress and areas needing further development.“Clearly every category has got its own range of innovation or maturity of innovation. For example, the foldable category – whether it was the Flip or the fold category, the level of integration of hardware software, and the sophistication of hardware is very impressive, the form factor is becoming better and more importantly, the weight of the device has become a lot better,” he said.“Similarly, in the desktops or in the laptop categories, the power of the chip, the power of a gaming console or a PC console, becoming similar and even the power of not only the laptops but also that you could do a multi-fold screen right on the same device, I think it is a great innovation,” Gurnani noted.“Number three on the devices, whether it was the robotics or whether it was small improvements of noise cancellation on the earbuds, I think there is a definitive progress. Where many of us still carry those battery chargers, I think we need to improve the battery life,” he added.Gurnani also shared his view on AI – the buzzword in today's tech industry.“AI will come into the design. AI will come into the use cases. Hopefully the medical devices industry will die as the camera industry died. At one stage, because if all your testing can be done on your smartwatch or your phone, I don't see any reason why a CT scan cannot be done through one of the devices,” he added.Other jury members included, chairman of the India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), who lent his expertise on manufacturing and market trends, offering a crucial perspective on the industry's trajectory., technology advisor at FTI Consulting, contributed decades of experience in technology journalism to the panel's deliberations., CEO of WinZO Games, enriched the discussion with his specialised knowledge of digital entertainment and gaming technologies., Business Head of Times Internet Ltd, lent his keen acumen to the jury, providing a crucial analytical perspective to the selection process.The Jury meet was moderated by Manisha Singh, editor, TOI Tech.The winners for the Jury's Choice Awards, along with the Popular Choice Awards—for which voting is open until February 7, 2025 – will be announced on February 14.","CP Gurnani is the co-founder and executive vice chairman of AIonOS.
