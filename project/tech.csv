What Exactly Is Pandora’s Lunchbox?

Positive boosts (like healing, energy recharge, or buffs),

Negative effects (such as debuffs, weird modifiers, or fresh conditions),

Or a combination of both.

This is why YOU NEVER use Pandora's Box | PEAK

So, Why Would You Use It?

1. It Removes the Curse Debuff

2. Emergency Reset Button

PEAK Trailer: OUT NOW!

When Not to Use It

In the bizarre, high-stakes world of PEAK, survival demands quick thinking, and sometimes, blind luck. That’s where Pandora’s Lunchbox comes in. This mysterious box is equal parts chaotic and clutch. It’s not your everyday tool; it’s more like cracking open chaos. But in the right situation, it could be your unexpected lifeline. Here’s what it is and why you should use it.Pandora’s Lunchbox is one of the most unpredictable items in PEAK. The moment you use it, it wipes away all negative status effects from your character. Sounds like a win, right? Well… not so fast.Right after the cleanse, the Lunchbox activates a hidden mechanic—a kind of internal ""effect budget""—that randomly adds new status effects to your character. These can be:The number of effects ranges from none to five, with two being the average. The outcomes? Totally unpredictable.Despite the risk, Pandora’s Lunchbox can actually be a clutch move, especially when things go south fast.Got revived and stuck with a nasty Curse? You can’t heal, you’re constantly losing progress, and it just won’t go away. The Lunchbox is currently the only known way to remove this specific debuff. If you’re Cursed and don’t want to burn valuable resources or die (again), popping the box could be your best shot.If you’re hanging by a thread, poisoned, drained, low on health, this item can act as a full reset. In some runs, it has completely restored health and energy in one go. Is that guaranteed? Nope. But when you’re already spiraling, it’s worth the gamble.If you're in control, fully powered, and moving smoothly through the game, maybe don’t mess with it. Opening Pandora’s Lunchbox when things are going well could replace your good fortune with a string of bad effects. And remember: once it’s open, there’s no undo button.Pandora’s Lunchbox is both a blessing and a bombshell. It clears your problems, but invites new ones in. That makes it perfect for desperate moments, but risky in stable ones. If you’re already sinking, take the chance. If you’re soaring, maybe keep it sealed. Because in PEAK, sometimes the only way forward... is to roll the dice.","Pandora’s Lunchbox is one of the most unpredictable items in PEAK.

Customers across affected regions began regaining connectivity, with mobile phone lines, internet access, and SIM card functionality returning to normal. The company thanked customers for their patience and encouraged those still experiencing issues to restart their devices or contact support for assistance.The outage affected a broad range of Rogers wireless services, including voice calls, data connections, and SMS messaging.

Nazi symbols prohibited in Germany



Nazi symbols not banned in the US



Lack of tech company regulation







""Hip-hop visionary, cultural icon and controversial genius YE will perform July 20, 2025 exclusively at the Rubicon Festival in Bratislava. It will be his only confirmed live performance in Europe in 2025 — and ever first show in Slovakia in history,"" organizers confirmed on the event's website on Monday. ""Rubicon Festival is raising the bar for European festivals to a whole new level.""His participation in the festival has sparked anger. More than 3,000 people have already signed a petition asking the festival to cancel the performance of the rapper, who is formerly known as Kanye West.The authors of the petition point out that Ye has in recent years repeatedly and openly adopted the symbolism and ideology associated with Nazi Germany, having written, for example, ""I am a Nazi"" and ""I love Hitler"" on social media platforms.""He trivializes the crimes of the totalitarian dictatorial regime and the war atrocities that also affected the Slovak population,"" the petition reads.The petition refers to Ye's latest track, ""Heil Hitler,"" which was released on May 8 — the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.The song references the Nazi salute which was used while Adolf Hitler was in power. The single's artwork resembles a swastika, and the song ends with a lengthy sample from a Hitler speech.As the petition also mentions, the song is banned in Germany.Within Germany, Ye's video cannot be seen among his posts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Changing one's location to the United States with a VPN makes the post visible.""Heil Hitler"" was used as an official greeting in Nazi Germany. The accompanying arm movement, which is made with the right arm extended and the palm facing down, is said to have its origins in ancient Rome and was then adopted by Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, in the 1920s.Later, Hitler made it a signature of the Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 until 1945.In the postwar era, West German authorities banned the use of many Nazi symbols and gestures as the country emerged from the Holocaust, which claimed millions of victims throughout Europe.The public display or dissemination of Nazi symbols and slogans such as the arm gesture or the phrase became a criminal offense under Section 86a of the German criminal code.This law prohibits the use of symbols associated with ""unconstitutional organizations,"" including those affiliated with the party, such the swastika, SS runes and the Nazi salute and slogans.Using such symbols or gestures can be punished with up to three years in prison or a fine.Denying the Holocaust is also illegal in Germany and many other European countries, as well as in Canada and Israel.Eighty years after the end of the war, the ban on Nazi-related content remains strictTo counter the rise of far-right groups and growing antisemitism, other countries have also banned hate symbols — some quite recently. In February, Australia passed a law against hate crimes that includes minimum sentences for displaying hate symbols, including the Nazi salute.In the United States, many forms of hate speech are protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment, which is meant to guarantee free expression.It is not illegal to perform a Nazi salute or wear a swastika in the United States.Since World War II, the salute has often been used by neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In 2016, for example, a shocking video showed a white supremacist group supporting Donald Trump's 2016 presidential win by raising their arms in an apparent Nazi-style salute.In January, X owner Elon Musk, who openly supports the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, came under scrutiny for performing what looked like a Nazi-style salute at Trump's second inauguration. Musk's defenders claimed it was accidental; many observers saw it as intentional.In response, activists from campaign group Led by Donkeys projected an image on his Tesla factory just outside of Berlin showing Musk doing the gesture, with the title appearing as ""Heil Tesla."" The group felt that if the German authorities considered the symbol to be illegal according to the country's criminal code, it would prove that Musk had performed the Nazi salute.Musk has come under fire for expressing antisemitic views in recent years, including responding to a user on X in 2023 who accused Jewish communities of ""pushing ... dialectical hatred against whites,"" a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists.""You have said the actual truth,"" Musk tweeted in a reply to the user.Though platforms including Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud worked to ban Ye's single quickly after its release because of its antisemitic content, the video was widely available on X. Even though Ye has been suspended multiple times from Twitter and now X for antisemitic content, his account has always been restored.Ye's celebrity status also led fans to share the video on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit, among other platforms, millions of times.It shows just how little power big tech companies seem to have — or want to put into removing offensive content once it has already been published. The video and the scramble to remove it have caused a renewed look at the content policies of major tech companies, particularly the social media platforms owned by Meta.In light of the video, the Anti-Defamation League, a US-based, international nongovernmental organization that combats antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination, started a petition asking Facebook and Instagram to ""reinstate guidelines meant to protect users from disinformation and hate"" on Facebook and Instagram.Meta announced in January that it would no longer employ fact checkers, and loosened rules around hate speech and abuse in light of ""recent elections"" — a reference to Trump's presidential win.Yet the pro-Hitler rhetoric spouted by Ye's latest single still falls under the company's rule of prohibiting ""harmful stereotypes historically linked to intimidation, including Blackface and Holocaust denial.""","More than 3,000 people have already signed a petition asking the festival to cancel the performance of the rapper. The petition refers to Ye's latest track, ""Heil Hitler,"" which was released on May 8 — the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The song references the Nazi salute which was used while Adolf Hitler was in power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122067456,imgsize-1123877,width-400,resizemode-4/122067456.jpg"
"What is China's mosquito drone? Capable of capturing images, audio & electronic signals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-mosquito-drone-capable-of-capturing-images-audio-electronic-signals-details/articleshow/122090220.cms,"Representative AI image





NEW DELHI: China showcased a miniature, insect-like drone designed for covert surveillance missions, drawing global attention and concern over its potential military and espionage uses.Developed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), the drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It was unveiled on the Chinese military broadcaster CCTV-7 as part of an exhibit on next-generation robotic systems.In a demonstration aired over the weekend, NUDT student researcher Liang Hexiang held up the ultra-light robot and said, “Here in my hand is a mosquito-like type of robot. Miniature bionic robots like this one are especially suited to information reconnaissance and special missions on the battlefield.”The drone, resembling a real mosquito, is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. It can reportedly operate silently and without radar detection, carrying ultra-miniature cameras and microphones to capture images, sounds, and electronic signals. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.According to The Defense Post, the device’s compact build enables it to evade conventional detection systems and operate in confined spaces — a feature that has raised alarms among privacy advocates and military analysts.Experts warn that such drones could be exploited for espionage, cyber intrusions, or even biological warfare.“This could mean greater access to restricted areas such as secure government facilities,” noted Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. “If China is able to produce mosquito-sized drones, it would likely be interested in using them for various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks, especially in places that larger drones struggle to access, such as indoor areas. These drones could be used to track individuals or listen in on conversations.”Other experts are raising more dystopian concerns. Tracey Follows, a futurist and former Google advisor, told The Sun that such drones could be used for “untraceable murders” or carry pathogens, referencing a Black Mirror episode in which robotic insects were weaponised for targeted killings. “In time, one expects a drone to have the situational awareness to carry out an attack autonomously without a human in the loop,” she said. “The big question is what's the payload on these drones, what are you actually attaching to the drone?”The mosquito-sized UAV is part of a broader NUDT programme exploring micro-robotics, with parallel developments including artillery-launched drones that can survive the extreme conditions of being fired from 155mm cannon shells. These innovations reflect China’s ambition to lead in micro-UAV technology, a field seeing increasing global competition.Other countries have made strides in this area. Norway’s Black Hornet, developed by Teledyne FLIR Defence, is already used by militaries worldwide. The latest version, the Black Hornet 4, won the 2025 Blue UAS Refresh award from the US Department of Defence for advancements in battery life, signal range, and wind resistance. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s RoboBee project has demonstrated insect-sized drones that can transition from water to air and even perch on surfaces using static electricity.Beyond military applications, microdrones are being explored for civilian use in medicine, agriculture, and disaster response. In healthcare, they could enable precision drug delivery or internal imaging. In environmental monitoring, their small size allows access to hazardous zones during floods, fires, or chemical spills.Still, with their stealth capabilities and growing autonomy, these tiny machines are poised to become one of the most ethically and strategically complex technologies of the decade.","The drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s upcoming “wedding of the century” in Venice was always bound to grab headlines - lavish, star-studded, and shrouded in exclusivity. But what no one saw coming? That the invitation card would steal the show and not in a good way.The multi-day extravaganza, reportedly hosting around 200 A-listers from Hollywood, tech, and politics, has already drawn fire for contributing to Venice’s overtourism crisis. Critics say it’s yet another example of billionaires turning cities into backdrops while locals are priced and pushed out.But now, the conversation has taken a turn, from too much luxury to not enough taste.ABC News obtained an image of the wedding invitation, and the internet hasn’t been the same since. The card is adorned with cartoonish doves, feathers, butterflies, shooting stars, and Venetian landmarks, gondolas and bridges included. What might have been intended as whimsical and romantic is now being dragged across X (formerly Twitter) as tacky, outdated, and, cheap-looking.“All that money and they couldn’t hire a designer?” one user said. Another took a dig by saying, “This looks like a 15-year-old made it on Canva.”Another mentioned, “Straight out of Microsoft Paint.” While an internet user quipped, “Proof that taste cannot be bought.”Some even joked it looked like AI-generated clip art, with one user saying, “Did Bezos ask ChatGPT to design this in 30 seconds?”While Bezos has spent the last year flaunting his new $500 million yacht, “Koru”, and planning a celebration fit for royalty, the humble invite has become the internet’s latest obsession, and not in the way the couple likely intended.But perhaps the irony is poetic: In an age where billionaires are building space rockets and planning underwater internet cables, it turns out the real rocket fuel for the public imagination is still... a bad wedding card.As the festivities gear up in Venice, it’s unclear whether Bezos will respond to the invite backlash. But one thing is certain, the internet RSVP’d with a resounding: “This could’ve been prettier.”","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s upcoming “wedding of the century’ in Venice was always bound to grab headlines.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Construction delays raise questions about opening timeline

Steakhouse meets stadium: What fans can expect

Kansas City Chiefs icons Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes may dominate on the football field, but their latest off-field venture—a high-end steakhouse called 1587 Prime—is facing some serious delays just months before its planned grand opening.Located in downtown Kansas City’s upscale Loews Hotel, the much-hyped restaurant is being marketed as a luxury hotspot blending fine dining with a football stadium vibe. But while Chiefs fans were expecting to enjoy ribeyes and red-zone replays under the same roof by late summer, insiders say construction problems could put those plans on ice.Recent footage from inside 1587 Prime has cast doubt on whether the space will be ready in time. The footage shows exposed framing, unfinished kitchen installations, and an overall construction zone far from completion. With NFL training camp around the corner, both Mahomes and Kelce have shifted their focus to football, leaving their hospitality partners at Noble 33 to carry the weight.The global restaurant group—known for trendy destinations like Meduza Mediterrania in New York—is tasked with turning the unfinished space into a two-story steakhouse experience unlike any other in Kansas City.The vision for 1587 Prime is ambitious. Guests will enter through a “stadium tunnel” leading to a host stand and a premium meat display modeled after an Arrowhead Stadium walkout. The first floor will feature sleek kitchens and a central wine wall, while the second story boasts an open-air kitchen and bar area showing exclusively Chiefs games.Private dining rooms and a VIP suite are also part of the plan. One unique touch? A celebrity viewing area with a two-way mirror, offering high-profile guests—like Taylor Swift—privacy while soaking in the ambiance.While the menu has yet to be revealed, it’s expected to center around American steakhouse classics—porterhouse, filet, strip cuts—with a focus on luxury that’s “still accessible,” a nod to Kelce and Mahomes’ blue-collar Midwestern roots.Also Read: “The damage…is permanent”: Taylor Swift furious over Blake Lively as Travis Kelce gets caught in between the legal storm With the NFL season approaching fast, all eyes are now on Noble 33.

Jason Kelce steals the show with hilarious speedo stunt at charity fundraiser



Jason Kelce may have retired from the NFL, but the former Philadelphia Eagles center hasn’t retired from making headlines—or making crowds laugh. On June 25, the 37-year-old turned heads and lifted spirits at a charity event in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, where he helped raise money for the Eagles Autism Foundation. But it wasn’t just his presence that got people talking—it was his unforgettable, stars-and-stripes-themed entrance.Arriving with a bright green lifeguard chair hoisted over his head, Kelce marched into the heart of the crowd, already setting the tone for something outrageous. Moments later, he climbed atop the towering chair and gave the audience a moment to brace themselves. Then came the big reveal: Kelce tore off his American flag-inspired boxer shorts to expose a snug, patriotic speedo and a white crop top. The crowd erupted.The “New Heights” podcast, co-hosted by Kelce and his brother Travis, didn’t miss the moment. Multiple fan-shot videos, some shared by the Eagles' official X (formerly Twitter) account, captured every angle of the surprise. As Kelce stood triumphantly in his patriotic outfit, the camera panned to spectators—some cheering, some gasping, others just plain stunned.One reaction stood out so much that Kelce decided to immortalize it.""That's one front row seat that will forever remain priceless,"" he remarked the next morning as he changed his X profile picture to a zoomed-in shot of the astonished fan.Though outrageous, the moment was filled with heart. Known for his beer-chugging, tank-top-wearing, luchador-mask-loving antics, Kelce brought that same chaotic energy to a cause close to his heart. His latest stunt wasn’t just for laughs—it was all for charity. The event successfully brought attention to the Eagles Autism Foundation, which continues to make a meaningful impact in the lives of individuals with autism and their families.Kelce’s showmanship and heart have always gone hand in hand. Post-retirement, he's proving that his larger-than-life personality isn’t confined to the football field—and when it comes to entertaining a crowd for a good cause, Jason Kelce knows exactly how to steal the spotlight.Also Read: What does Aaron Rodgers' possible retirement mean for the Steelers’ future plans?","Jason Kelce stole the show at a charity event in Sea Isle City, New Jersey.

Lauren Kyle’s friendship moves sparked a deeper bond between Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl

The life Connor McDavid has off the ice continues to affect his on-ice chemistry in both subtle and subliminal ways. At the very heart of this connection lies his wife, Lauren Kyle, who has quietly propagated this relationship between Connor and Leon Draisaitl, his Edmonton Oilers teammate. Their partnership transcends goals and assists, being driven by relationships at the partner level. With Lauren's bond creating lasting off-ice camaraderie, the McDavid-Draisaitl duo is positioning itself as an example of how a personal foundation can fuel professional brilliance.While the Oilers stars have represented the Edmonton branch of the NHL for close to the past decade, the off-ice camaraderie is now elevated as a result of Lauren Kyle. In a recent Forbes interview, Lauren revealed how she introduced Draisaitl to her high school pal, actress Celeste Desjardins . Bearing the happy elegance of the dual couples in the lives of both Oilers stars and detracting somewhat from the life of the female star, it furthers the camaraderie between the two Oilers stars.The friendship of their partners has grown into a double couple system, allowing the players to be more comfortable with each other on a personal level. Lauren opined that the friendship between the two players probably does become stronger by virtue of their partners' closeness.The two women, Celeste and Lauren, served in the wedding party at McDavid and Kyle's wedding last summer. With Draisaitl acting as a groomsman and Celeste as a bridesmaid, the act served to cement the bonds between the group.Recently, Lauren and Celeste enjoyed their bachelorette party in Greece, together with Miakyla, wife of another Oilers player, Darnell Nurse. The regular social activities among players’ spouses have made the Edmonton locker room feel more like a family, and this is a winning advantage on the ice.Unless it is just friendships making a difference, McDavid’s future desire could be the other factor. Kyle recently opened a luxury bar and furniture store in downtown Edmonton, owning a fashion brand called “Sports Club Atelier” alongside the Oilers. According to NHL insider Chris Johnston, the development of these personal and professional ties could urge McDavid to look at a longer-term contract extension with his team.Also Read: How will the Edmonton Oilers retain Connor McDavid? With all the heat from the Cup bid, contract discussions gain momentum Lauren Kyle may not sport skates or slapshots, but her work comes quietly as the glue that develops the bonds in the Edmonton Oilers. Apart from building a close relationship between Leon Draisaitl and one of her best friends, she also operated on the local business front, which makes Edmonton her home. As the core streets of the Oilers solidify, this type of off-ice relationship might be what goes into growing a winning mentality.","Lauren Kyle's friendship with actress Celeste Desjardins cemented the bond between Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl.

Mikayla Raines

""This is Completely Devastating"" – Asmongold’s Initial Reaction to Mikayla Raines' Bullying

""I kind of feel weird watching this and reacting to this entire thing... This is a video I never planned on making, and it's completely devastating having to sit down and watch this."" Asmongold

""She was so sensitive to everything, which is a double-edged sword because on one hand, it allowed her endless empathy for those in her care, but it also means that she took everything negative to heart.""

The Role of Reddit and Online Harassment in Mikayla's

Reddit is f*cking evil, man..

""Reddit has rules against witch hunting, right? And the problem is that there are subreddits that are created that are dedicated to witch hunting... How is it that you have subreddits that are dedicated to just posting negative content about a person constantly, right? And even lying about them?"" Asmongold

""When you have an entire subreddit that's dedicated to hating on one person specifically... you really need to ask yourself, is this really something that's positive for the website?""

The Psychology Behind Online Hate

""I think a lot of people out there are losers, and when they see somebody out there who's doing something that's productive, that's successful... they're mad because it's like, 'Well, I'm not doing anything, so I have to figure out a reason why.'""

""It’s Not Just Reddit’s Fault"" – A Nuanced Take

""For people to say that it's entirely because of Reddit that this happened... I don't think that's really a very fair analysis.""

Should Online Bullies Be Legally Punished?

""If you're weaponizing a government program to execute your internet beef, you have a huge problem... That's where it crosses the line.""

""The issue is not that people are saying mean things—it’s that there are communities dedicated solely to destroying someone’s life.""

Popular Twitch streamer and content creatorrecently reacted to the tragic death of, an animal rescuer who took her own life after enduring relentless online harassment. The video, which included a heartfelt message from Mikayla’s loved ones, sparked a deep and emotional discussion about cyberbullying, Reddit’s role in fostering toxic communities, and the real-life consequences of online hate.Asmongold, known for his unfiltered commentary, approached the topic with surprising sensitivity, acknowledging the devastating impact of Mikayla Raines’ death while also dissecting the broader issues at play.From the start, Asmongold made it clear that this was not an easy topic to cover.He highlighted Mikayla Raines’ work with Save a Fox Rescue, emphasizing how her empathy for animals made her particularly vulnerable to online cruelty.Asmongold didn’t shy away from criticizing Reddit, particularly its failure to enforce its own rules against witch-hunting. He pointed out that entire subreddits exist solely to target and harass individuals, often with little to no moderation.He argued that while free speech is important, platforms must take responsibility when communities actively facilitate harassment.Asmongold speculated on why people engage in such vicious behavior, suggesting that much of it stems from insecurity and jealousy.He also noted that online harassment often escalates beyond just words—people weaponize real-life systems (like false CPS reports or swatting) to inflict harm.""Closing your eyes isn't going to stop you from hearing the knock on the door from CPS... When internet communities try to weaponize real-life consequences, that's where accountability needs to come in.""While Asmongold condemned the online harassment Mikayla Raines faced, he also cautioned against placing all the blame on anonymous commenters. He pointed out that, according to the statements from Mikayla’s loved ones, people she knew personally—including other animal rescuers and even friends—contributed to her distress.He stressed that suicide is rarely caused by a single factor but rather a combination of personal struggles and external pressures.When asked whether those who harassed Mikayla should face legal consequences, Asmongold was hesitant. He said, ""No, you can't charge people because they sent someone a mean message on the internet. That's crazy.""However, he drew a clear line when harassment escalates to real-world threats, such as doxxing, swatting, or false reports to authorities.Asmongold ended his reaction by reiterating that while the internet will always have toxicity, platforms must do more to curb organized harassment campaigns.He also emphasized that anonymity online is an illusion, warning that those who engage in severe harassment could eventually face consequences if law enforcement gets involved.Asmongold’s reaction to Mikayla Raines’ death was a mix of anger, empathy, and pragmatism. While he acknowledged the tragic impact of cyberbullying, he also pushed back against oversimplifying the situation, urging a more nuanced discussion about accountability—both for individuals and the platforms that enable them.Also read: What led to Mikayla Raines death: Inside the YouTuber’s battle with cyberbullying Mikayla’s story serves as a grim reminder of how online cruelty can have real-world consequences, and Asmongold’s commentary adds to the growing call for better moderation, personal responsibility, and systemic change in how we handle digital harassment.Rest in peace, Mikayla. 🦊💔","Twitch streamer and content creatorrecently reacted to the tragic death of, an animal rescuer who took her own life after enduring relentless online harassment.
