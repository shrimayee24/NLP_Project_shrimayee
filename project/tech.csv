Dana White announces $100K bonuses for undercard fighters at Canelo Alvarez vs Terence Crawford event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/dana-white-announces-100k-bonuses-for-undercard-fighters-at-canelo-alvarez-vs-terence-crawford-event/articleshow/123859351.cms,"Dana White (Image Source: Getty)

Dana White’s perspective on every step he took

The vision of giving visibility and respect to talents who fail to gain the spotlight

UFC President Dana White announced something extremely surprising yet exciting. Undercard fighters will have the chance to earn $100,000 bonuses at the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight, which is nearing. This move is a major shake-up in how boxing events reward fighters, especially those not in the main event spotlight.Traditionally, undercard fighters are the athletes who compete before the main attraction and rarely see significant bonuses. White’s announcement changes that. Each undercard bout will feature two $100,000 awards: one for Fight of the Night and one for Performance of the Night. That’s $200,000 per fight, on top of whatever the fighters normally earn. For many athletes on the undercard, this could be life-changing money.White explained the decision in his signature straightforward style that Canelo and Crawford are going to be excluded from the bonus reward event on Saturday night. But on the undercard fights, they are going to have a Performance of the Night and a Fight of the Night as the main focus for his announcement. His approach clearly represents a keen interest in putting a spotlight on the fighters who usually get overlooked.The undercard of the event will feature nine fights. Athletes like Callum Walsh and Fernando Vargas Jr. are the primary stars of the preliminary matches. Every fighter on these undercards will be eligible for the bonuses. Their opportunity to portray a show will help them bag a strong incentive. The hope is that this will push fighters to bring their best, making the entire fight night more thrilling for fans.Also Read: UFC boss Dana White says he wants Conor McGregor, not Jon Jones, to headline White House UFC event This announcement is about more than just money. It’s about respect. For too long, undercard fighters have fought in relative obscurity, often putting in the same dedication and training as the stars of the evening. By offering these bonuses, White is recognizing their effort and contribution to the sport.This initiative throws light on the growing influence of UFC leaders in boxing. The bonus culture is familiar in MMA to a boxing card. White is bridging the two sports in a way that benefits fighters and fans alike. Other promoters may soon follow, raising the bar for how undercard fighters are treated and rewarded.As fight night approaches, this announcement has already created a lot of chatter. Fans are eager to see which fighters will rise to the occasion, and athletes are no doubt motivated by the chance to walk away with a $100,000 bonus. Dana White’s bold move is setting a new standard in boxing, proving that even the fighters who compete before the main event deserve recognition, excitement, and reward.","Undercard fighters will have the chance to earn $100,000 bonuses at the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight.

Alongside the Air, Apple also introduced the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro, as well as Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, SE 3, and AirPods Pro 3, further solidifying its unmatched ecosystem dominance. The highly anticipated launch has generated massive worldwide buzz across social media platforms, technology forums, industry panels, tech blogs, and consumer communities alike. Among notable reactions, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised the iPhone Air, calling it the first Apple upgrade he’s genuinely excited about in years, highlighting its significance even to forward-thinking industry innovators and dedicated Apple fans worldwide.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter): “First new iPhone upgrade I have really wanted in awhile! Looks very cool.”Altman’s endorsement signals that Apple’s innovative design and cutting-edge technology appeal not only to general consumers but also to leading tech innovators globally. His reaction amplified social media conversations, inspiring lively debates on the iPhone Air’s advantages, performance features, and comparisons with the iPhone 17 Pro.His endorsement further highlights how Apple continues to shape trends and influence leaders across AI, software, and broader technology sectors.Apple described the iPhone Air as “impossibly thin and light,” emphasising portability without sacrificing durability.

In addition, the iPhone 17 series brings major upgrades in display, battery, and camera performance, maintaining Apple’s reputation for innovation and cutting-edge technology.Beyond the hardware, Apple unveiled enhanced software features, including iOS 19 improvements for faster multitasking, new widgets, and AI-powered photography tools, which further enhance the overall user experience, convenience, and personalization on the iPhone Air.The iPhone Air measures just 5.6 millimeters in thickness, making it roughly a third thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro, and it weighs 165 grams.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Meanwhile, Musk, who appeared to have seen some of the videos, said in a post, “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies.

Microsoft’s controversy over Azure and Gaza





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.""According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said. “There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that.”",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees the company needs to rebuild trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return- to-office rule that the company announced recently. The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123845941,imgsize-20982,width-400,resizemode-4/satya-nadella.jpg"

In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step. Here’s how the process works:","UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID in one step. Age-based validity auto-assigned through ICP’s digital platforms.

China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy.

Confessions of a food and sex addict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/mind-field/confessions-of-a-food-and-sex-addict/articleshow/123862199.cms,"Confessions of a food and sex addict





On Instagram Slutty Cheff dishes out food and sex stories, as if one were not possible without the other. It’s thus predictable that no sooner is her first book, Tart: Misadventures of an Anonymous Chef, out that a TV adaptation is in the works. One way to think about this memoir is to imagine that Bridget Jones’s Diary procreated with The Bear with the “chaos and delinquency” of Anthony Bourdain The twenty-something female chef who takes you into London’s hot, intense, exhausting kitchens by day and its urine-drenched streets by night, relishes the super highs in both her worklife and lovelife, each lavishly soaked in ciggy breaks like these never went out of fashion. Through it all, her go-go inner monologue has the reader sort of feeling the ketamine she recreationally partakes.But like Carmy in The Bear, as high as she hits, it’s never too long before anxiety swings her super low. In this phase, her job feels monotonous and its hard labour thankless. She’s either up or down, all or nothing.And lots of her co-workers seem to feel the same. A fellow twenty-something chef Finn says at one of their post-service drunkathons, “We work in kitchens because it’s never boring. You love it then you hate it then you love it again.It’s like a proper good romance.”There’s a scene in which Cheff is rush-slicing some red onion for the pickles to go with pâté and slices her thumb right next to a scar that just healed over. She whacks on plaster and a blue plastic glove, which floods with blood within seconds. This little nick will mean weeks of her modifying every single movement to avoid the pain of lemon juice dripping into the cut. She thinks about how special this is, using her hurt to make nice things that bring pleasure to both herself and complete strangers.It’s possible that only in anonymity is this female chef able to write with the earthiness of male authors. Like she describes sizzling a roux for béchamel sauce, heavily distracted by sex flashbacks that feel like a Hollywood-produced trailer of her recent, broad daylight booty call.One major prism through which this book is being discussed is what distinct female perspective it brings to the traditionally male-dominated narrative of kitchen culture. Cheff is found working mostly with men. A few do turn out to be pervs. But most are driven by a passion for their craft just like her, working for the “check monster” beyond exhaustion, with razor-thin margins for error, struggling with anxiety and addiction.One bitterness about the London restaurant scene is how its socialite chef circles are elitist, exclusive and often about who you know, not what you cook.Slutty Cheff has main character energy. Her book agrees with the dramas starring men that chefs have a special power, there is so much passion and so many thrills in this service that it makes sense for people to be drawn to its leading actors. When she starts out, unsure if she belongs among the men, she wonders if women chefs have the same appeal. Yes they do, the book shows the reader.But also yes, it ‘shows’ lots of lovely, lovely food. Like a Negroni, described as, “Oranges, booze, sticky lips, pink cheeks, bright lights, and warm pavements.”","Slutty Cheff dishes out food and sex stories, as if one were not possible without the other.

On the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality. The International Astronomical Centre will stream the entire celestial event live from Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory, making it accessible to a global audience.The International Astronomical Centre confirmed that it will livestream the total lunar eclipse using a telescope stationed at the Al-Khattm Astronomical Observatory. The broadcast is scheduled to run for more than four hours, from, providing uninterrupted real-time coverage of the phenomenon.According to Engineer Mohammed Shawkat Odah, Director of the International Astronomical Centre, the eclipse will unfold in several distinct stages:Odah noted that the most visually dramatic period — when the Moon turns a striking shade of red — will last 82 minutes, making it one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent years. This stage, known as totality, will be clearly visible to the naked eye across all seven emirates from 9:30 PM to 10:52 PM GST.Additionally, Odah stated that the phenomenon can be observed at different stages across the Arab region depending on geographic location:A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its central shadow (umbra) onto the Moon. During this alignment, sunlight passes through Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red tones to reach the Moon’s surface. This atmospheric refraction creates the phenomenon commonly known as a Blood Moon.Two aspects make tonight’s event particularly remarkable:The Moon will not completely disappear during totality. Instead, it will take on shades of orange, red, or yellow, depending on atmospheric conditions. According to Odah, the color intensity is a reflection of atmospheric purity. Increased pollution, for instance, can cause the Moon to appear dark red or brown. In rare instances, such as the December 12, 1992 eclipse (influenced by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines), the Moon has vanished entirely from view during totality.The total eclipse phase, where the Moon is fully immersed in the Earth’s umbra, will be. The timings for the totality are consistent nationwide:The Moon’s changing appearance, from bright white to glowing red, will be clearly visible without the need for telescopes, although observatories and livestreams will offer detailed views.Looking ahead, skywatchers in the UAE can mark their calendars for future lunar events:The next total eclipse will coincide with New Year’s Eve, setting the stage for another dramatic Blood Moon — this time, during year-end celebrations.","On September 7, 2025, skywatchers across the UAE are set to witness one of the longest total lunar eclipses in recent memory, with 82 minutes of deep red totality.

A unified vision for land and water mobility





Dubai is advancing its vision of a smarter, more connected city with two major transport projects now underway: the construction of the Dh20.5-billion Dubai Metro Blue Line and the launch of two new marine stations on Dubai Creek. These developments are set to significantly reduce congestion, cut travel times, and boost mobility across key urban and waterfront areas.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line, a massive infrastructure project that will expand the city’s rail network by 30 kilometres and add 14 new stations. As part of the initial works, a key traffic diversion has been introduced near Centrepoint Station, affecting access from Airport Road to the multi-storey car park.Motorists can now reach the car park via 49C Street, making a left turn west of the facility. The RTA has urged drivers to follow all directional signboards, plan trips ahead, and use alternative routes to avoid delays. Similar traffic changes are also in effect near Creek Station, as early construction continues there as well.The Blue Line is expected to open by September 9, 2029, and is designed to carry 46,000 passengers per hour in both directions.It aims to reduce traffic congestion by 20% on the routes it serves, cutting travel time between key residential areas and Dubai International Airport to just 20 minutes.When complete, the Blue Line will extend the total length of the Dubai Metro network to 131km, serving 78 stations and operating 28 trains. The project is expected to generate Dh56 million in profits and carry 200,000 passengers per day by 2030, with that number projected to rise to 320,000 by 2040.These areas are expected to be home to over one million people, as envisioned in the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan.Travel times along the Blue Line will range from 10 to 25 minutes, significantly improving daily commutes for thousands of residents.In a separate milestone, the RTA has also inaugurated two new marine transport stations:Both are strategically located on Dubai Creek and support the RTA’s Marine Transport Strategic Plan 2020–2030, which aims to make water transport a key part of the emirate’s mobility network.These stations follow the design principles of recently upgraded facilities like Bur Dubai and Old Deira Souq, combining modernisation with heritage preservation.The newly opened stations feature enhanced capacity and passenger experience, aligning with upgrades seen across the network, such as the 15% capacity increase at Deira Old Souq Station earlier this year.The stations were completed simultaneously to reduce costs and accelerate delivery, with a new operational plan in place to ensure timely trips, safe navigation, and efficient services.Marine transport ridership is on the rise, with 9.7 million passengers using the network in the first half of 2025 alone — a strong indicator of public confidence in Dubai’s evolving transport infrastructure.Together, the Dubai Metro Blue Line and the new marine stations reflect a city-wide push to create a seamlessly integrated, multimodal transport network. These upgrades are not only addressing current mobility needs but are also being built with future urban growth and sustainability in mind. The RTA is also exploring smart technologies to enhance real-time connectivity and improve overall commuter experience across the transport network.As work progresses, the RTA continues to advise residents and commuters to stay informed about diversions and changes, and to plan travel in advance. Whether by rail or water, Dubai’s transport infrastructure is moving swiftly toward a more connected, efficient, and accessible future.","Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has begun construction on the Dubai Metro Blue Line.

A video of Indian devotees performing Ganesh Visarjan in a river in the United Kingdom has gone viral on social media as video sparked both admiration and criticism on online.The visuals show a group of devotees in traditional attire carrying a Ganesh idol on a boat and immersing it in the river, which was on Instagram by user @sandeep_anthwal. The immersion of the Ganesh idol was carried out vibrantly on the beats of the dhol in a ritualistic manner.Ganesh Visarjan, which marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav, is observed across India with grand processions and massive public gatherings.While many users hailed the viral video as a heartwarming display of culture abroad, others raised concerns over the environmental impact of immersing idols in natural water bodies.“This is such a beautiful display of tradition, it feels like home away from home,” one user commented. Another countered, “Why are people polluting rivers abroad in the name of tradition?”Some viewers were captivated by the presence of swans in the frame. “Watching the swans swim so close to the idol is magical,” commented another.Ganesh Utsav, celebrated widely across India, involves bringing home idols of Lord Ganesh, worshipping them for ten days, and immersing them in rivers, lakes or seas on the final day. In recent years, several Indian states have encouraged the use of eco-friendly idols and artificial immersion tanks to minimise harm to the environment.The UK video, however, has opened up a fresh debate on how such traditions are carried out overseas, with the diaspora community striving to preserve cultural practices while facing scrutiny over their ecological impact.",Ganesh Visarjan marks the culmination of the ten-day Ganesh Utsav.

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Expert Drops Bombshell





The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana’s death may reignite one of the monarchy’s most bitter rivalries. According to royal expert Tom Sykes, Prince William and Prince Harry could be planning competing documentaries on their late mother—threatening to turn her legacy into their latest battleground.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Sykes revealed that he’s heard “on good authority” that the brothers, who have not spoken in years, are exploring separate projects to commemorate Diana in 2027. William is reportedly “not remotely amused” by whispers that Harry and Meghan Markle are working on a Netflix feature tied to their Archewell deal—especially after previous projects were panned as “boring” and “disastrous. ”“We could have dueling Diana documentaries from the two boys,” Sykes suggested, noting how such films could cement their clashing narratives about the princess’s life and the events surrounding her 1997 death.The timing comes as Sykes himself stirs controversy with a fresh essay revisiting conspiracy theories about Diana’s fatal Paris car crash, raising questions about whether her death was as straightforward as official inquiries concluded.While he stops short of calling for the case to be reopened, Sykes insists “the holes in the story are just so fascinating, it’s all hidden in plain sight.”Diana was killed on August 31, 1997, when a Mercedes driven by Henri Paul crashed in a Paris underpass. Paul and Diana’s companion, Dodi Fayed, also died. An official investigation blamed speed and Paul’s intoxication, but speculation about foul play has never fully disappeared.Now, as the brothers approach this milestone anniversary on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Diana’s memory risks becoming collateral damage in their fractured relationship.","The 30th anniversary of Princess Diana's death may reignite one of the monarchy's most bitter rivalries.

The opening of the capsule has not only sparked renewed public curiosity about her life and legacy but also rekindled interest in the social history of a decade still fondly remembered today.The capsule’s contents painted a vivid picture of the early 1990s. Among the most striking discoveries was a Kylie Minogue CD, reflecting Diana’s well-known interest in contemporary music and her connection with pop culture.

Historians suggest it was designed to reflect not only her personal interests but also the broader social and cultural context that defined the early 1990s. At a time when Diana was reshaping the image of the monarchy through her openness and relatability, the capsule stands as a symbolic act of remembrance, preserving tangible fragments of a rapidly changing world. Its opening now allows both fans and historians to connect more personally with Diana’s life and the era she influenced.The opening of the capsule has generated fascination far beyond royal enthusiasts. For the public, the contents stir nostalgia for a decade often remembered with fondness and curiosity.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.
