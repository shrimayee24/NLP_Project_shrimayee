The Legacy Continues

Travis Kelce is no stranger to the spotlight‚Äîwhether he's catching touchdowns or, more recently, dating pop megastar Taylor Swift (yeah, Swifties, take a breath). The Kansas City Chiefs' tight end has made quite the name for himself both on and off the football field, building an empire that stretches beyond just the NFL . So, what's Kelce's game plan for his wealth, fame, and future? Let‚Äôs dive in!Also read - Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's relationship timeline Drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, Travis Kelce‚Äôs rise to stardom didn‚Äôt happen overnight‚Äîunless you count the thousands of Chiefs fans who have lost sleep screaming ‚ÄúTouchdown, Kelce!‚Äù With three Super Bowl rings (2019, 2022, 2023) and nine Pro Bowl selections, Kelce‚Äôs r√©sum√© is already stacked like an all-you-can-eat buffet.He‚Äôs even earned a spot in the ‚ÄúBest Tight Ends Ever‚Äù debate‚Äîthough we suspect Taylor might have a few ""championships"" of her own in mind for their relationship. üòèKelce‚Äôs current net worth? A cool $70 million. That‚Äôs a lot of zeros‚Äîand not the kind he‚Äôs putting up on the scoreboard. After raking in over $77 million from NFL contracts alone, Kelce isn‚Äôt just stacking touchdowns; he‚Äôs stacking bills. His most recent contract extension with the Chiefs, inked in 2024, will keep him rolling in the dough until 2025‚Äîpocketing a hefty $17.1 million per season.But Kelce didn‚Äôt always have his finances on lock. During his rookie years, he almosthis fortune with lavish spending habits. After wising up, Kelce now advises younger players to get a good financial team. After all, even the best touchdown dancers need accountants to keep things smooth in the end zone.Not only is Travis a beast on the field, but he‚Äôs also a brand‚Äôs dream off it. From McDonald's to Nike and even Helzberg Diamonds (we see you, Taylor üëÄ), Kelce is cashing in on his fun-loving personality. Let‚Äôs be honest: this guy is basically America‚Äôs favorite tight end with a side of swagger. He‚Äôs got deals with big brands like Tide, Old Spice, and Amazon‚Äîbecause who else can smell fresh while winning rings and breaking records?When you‚Äôve got Super Bowl rings, you need somewhere to store them, right? Kelce recently snagged a $6 million mansion in Leawood, Kansas. Think 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, and a backyard that‚Äôs basically a playground for adults‚Äîtennis court, pickleball, mini-golf course, and pool included. Swifties, there's plenty of room for house parties, though we're sure Taylor's already planning the next ""Reputation""-themed sleepover.And let‚Äôs not forget the cars‚ÄîKelce rolls around in everything from a GMC Terrain to a Mercedes Benz AMG G63. His car collection is almost as versatile as his route-running on the field.Behind all the glitz and glam, Kelce‚Äôs heart beats for giving back. His charity, 87 and Running, helps disadvantaged youth succeed in areas like education, business, and athletics. Whether he‚Äôs raising awareness for childhood cancer or empowering kids through Operation Breakthrough, Kelce knows how to make an impact off the field. You love to see it‚ÄîSuper Bowl champ by day, superhero by night.With 10 years in the NFL under his belt and no signs of slowing down, Travis Kelce has accomplished more than most could dream of. His records are piling up as quickly as Taylor Swift's streaming numbers, and he‚Äôs not done yet. Whether he‚Äôs dominating on the field, cashing in on endorsement deals, or stealing hearts (üëã, Taylor), Travis Kelce is proof that life in the NFL can be as thrilling as a last-minute game-winning drive.Also read - When Taylor Swift flaunted her customized $850 Chiefs jacket at Travis Kelce's game","Travis Kelce is a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.

In the images, the utilitarian bins come to life with carefully arranged accessories - cameras, headphones, tickets. Some displays get elaborate, adding designer purses and makeup, while others simply arrange commonplace items in a nicer way.A recent video showed a creator's monochrome variations for different cities. Others opt to display the contents of their gadget-filled personal carry-on item or their favourite book. For Hitha Palepu , the author of ""How to Pack: Travel Smart for Any Trip"", the trend is one of her ""biggest travel pet peeves and icks"" for several reasons: inconsideration of fellow travellers and security staff, ""gross"" hygiene and an unrealistic portrayal of the messy - and often stressful - realities of travel. (A 2018 study found that the plastic trays carry more cold germs than airport toilets.)As if the base line anxiety of travel weren't enough to deal with, adding ""annoyed"" to the roster of emotions might send some travellers like Celeste Hernandez, 27, over the edge. ""The way I'm waiting for TSA to yell at me just because I'm taking my sweater off,"" she said, en route to Houston from New York. But some said onlookers were too quick to be grumpy about the latest influencer trend. The posts, many said, were meant to be expressive, celebrate the joy of travel or bond with friends.The Transportation Security Administration is aware of the trend, but a spokesperson said the agency had no problem with it ""as long as the staged glamour photos are not causing delays or issues with other passengers in the checkpoint.""The trend may have started as a way to help sell products. A video on this topic was a marketing attempt by Sarin Jivalagian, the founder of an online store for vintage bags . She and her friends arranged a photoshoot on some benches after the security line at Hollywood Burbank Airport in California. Some people jumped to conclusions, she said, assuming that she had been holding up the line. ""Did you do this in Des Moines, Iowa?"" One commenter asked, ""because where did they let you take up this much time in TSA????"" Even if pictures are taken after security, ""that's one less bin to get through security seamlessly,"" Palepu, the author, said. ""That's inconsiderate."""," influencers and content creators have flooded TikTok, Instagram and other social media sites with pictures and videos of aesthetically pleasing airport trays.

Hobby apps over dating apps? Why fitness and reading platforms are the new matchmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/hobby-apps-over-dating-apps-why-fitness-and-reading-platforms-are-the-new-matchmakers/articleshow/113214577.cms,"Strava sees significant growth

Hobby platforms turned social networks

Why the shift?

The changing landscape of social apps

Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are no longer the go-to platforms for singles seeking love. Instead, people are now turning to Goodreads and Strava , apps initially designed for running, reading, and other hobbies, to find their perfect match.Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year, according to Sensor Tower and reported by The Guardian.This surge in users has prompted Strava to introduce a new messaging feature, allowing users to connect while tracking their fitness goals.Other hobby-based apps are also seeing a boost in users. Ravelry, a social network for knitting enthusiasts, now boasts a user base of over 9 million. Goodreads, the platform for book lovers, has accumulated more than 150 million members. Meanwhile, Letterboxd , an app for movie enthusiasts, has seen its user base explode from 1.8 million in March 2020 to over 14 million this summer. The app‚Äôs impressive 55% growth in monthly active users highlights the increasing popularity of these niche social networks.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at the Centre for Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, explains that these hobby-based apps allow users to connect through shared interests, creating a more engaging and less contentious environment. This focus on common passions reduces the need for stringent content moderation and enhances the overall user experience.Letterboxd‚Äôs editor-in-chief, Gemma Gracewood, adds that the app‚Äôs design, which includes in-line comments and a community-focused approach, discourages public shaming and amplifies the positive interactions among users. Similarly, Goodreads and Strava offer messaging features that foster connections without the risk of public shaming prevalent on other platforms.As users increasingly migrate from traditional social networks and dating apps, new platforms are emerging as havens for genuine connections. With many abandoning Elon Musk‚Äôs social network due to controversies over free speech, apps like Bluesky and Threads are seeing a resurgence, while hobby-based platforms continue to thrive.Are suggests that the lower expectations and less sexually charged atmosphere on these hobby apps create a more relaxed environment for users seeking meaningful connections. Unlike traditional dating apps, which can often feel like a ‚Äúdating supermarket,‚Äù these platforms offer a refreshing alternative for those looking to find love through shared interests.","Strava, the popular fitness app known for tracking running and cycling activities, has experienced a substantial 20% increase in user numbers over the past year.

As Prince William gears up for his future role as King , it seems there's no room for reconciliation with his brother, Prince Harry , and sister-in-law, Meghan Markle . According to an insider speaking to OK! Magazine, William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" setting the stage for a significant shift in Royal Family dynamics.The source revealed that William has a clear vision for his reign, which involves a deliberate distancing from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.This approach aligns with previous reports suggesting that the Sussexes will be relegated to the periphery of royal life, with no hopes for reintegration.""William is already strategizing for his time as King, and he doesn‚Äôt see a future for the Sussexes within the Royal Family,"" the insider said. ""The prevailing sentiment is that bringing them back into the fold would be a mistake.""According to a former palace staff member, William might even consider issuing a Letters Patent to strip the Sussexes of their HRH titles, although their Dukedom could only be addressed by Parliament. This move would ensure a formal and irreversible separation from the royal family.The tensions between William and Harry have been well-documented, particularly following the release of Harry‚Äôs memoir, Spare. One notable point of contention for William has been Harry‚Äôs depiction of Kate Middleton‚Äôs supposed coldness towards Meghan. Insiders report that William has been reticent about discussing Harry lately, suggesting the rift remains wide and deep.The brothers' strained relationship was evident at a recent memorial for their uncle, Sir Robert Fellowes. Attendees noted that William and Harry kept their distance, barely acknowledging each other's presence.As Prince William prepares for his future role, it appears the divide between him and Harry is set to become a defining feature of his reign, leaving the Sussexes on the fringes of royal life.","Prince William's strategy is ""swift and final,"" an insider told OK!

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, ‚ÄúTo do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.‚ÄùUsers will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Research and Targeting: Attackers meticulously research their target, gathering information about their personal and professional lives. This includes identifying their social media accounts, professional affiliations, and any publicly available information.

Social Engineering: Once the target is identified, attackers craft personalised phishing emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source. These messages may contain urgent requests for financial assistance, information sharing, or other actions that seem legitimate.

Trust and Manipulation: Attackers employ social engineering techniques to manipulate their targets into believing the authenticity of the message. They may leverage emotional appeals, create a sense of urgency, or exploit personal information to build trust.

Data Extraction: Once the target falls victim, attackers may attempt to extract sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or proprietary data. This information can be used for financial gain, identity theft, or other malicious purposes.



Tips to stay protected:

Always be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those requesting urgent action or containing unusual attachments.

Before responding to any suspicious message, verify the sender's identity using known contact information.

Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.

Employ strong, unique passwords for all online accounts and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.

Ensure that your operating system and software applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Limit the amount of personal information you share online, especially on social media platforms.

Stay informed about the latest phishing scams and techniques to recognise and avoid them.
