Regulatory standoff continues despite changes

Apple has introduced sweeping changes to its European Union App Store policies, introducing a complicated multi-tier fee system aimed at avoiding crushing daily fines that could reach €50 million under the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA).The company now allows EU developers to freely link customers to alternative payment methods outside the App Store without restrictive warning screens or mandatory text. However, these freedoms come with new costs through Apple's revamped commission structure.Under the updated system, developers face up to three separate fees for a single app download. Apple introduced a "" Core Technology Commission "" of 5% on all digital purchases made outside the App Store, alongside an initial acquisition fee of 2% and variable store services fees ranging from 5% to 13%.The company also created a two-tier service structure. Tier 1 offers basic features like app reviews and fraud protection for a 5% commission, while Tier 2 provides full App Store benefits including automatic updates, marketing tools, and app insights for 13%. Small Business Program participants receive reduced rates.Apps using external payment links will pay the Core Technology Commission, while those merely referencing outside deals continue under the existing Core Technology Fee of €0.50 per download after one million installs.Apple's modifications follow a €500 million fine imposed in April for violating DMA anti-steering rules. The European Commission threatened additional daily penalties worth up to 5% of Apple's global revenue if the company failed to comply by June 26.""We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal,"" Apple stated, maintaining its opposition to the regulatory requirements.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company successfully challenged Apple's US steering policies, criticized the changes as ""malicious compliance"" that commercially cripples competing payment systems.The European Commission will now assess whether Apple's proposals achieve genuine DMA compliance before determining if additional fines are warranted.",Apple introduces multi-tier fee system aimed at avoiding crushing daily fines.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk on jobs that AI can not replace: ‘There will be…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-on-jobs-that-ai-can-not-replace-there-will-be/articleshow/122123631.cms,"Google Search AI Mode launched in India: Does it really make your search smarter?

Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes that while artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform many industries, some jobs may remain uniquely human. In a response to a question posted by Peter H. Diamandis – Executive Chairman @XPRIZE on X (formerly Twitter), Musk said: ‘There will be a premium for human experiences”. Diamandis, in the X post, asked the following question: “Which jobs will AI not be able to automate?”.Musk’s comment highlights a growing concern about the future of work as AI technologies become more advanced. Many experts predict widespread automation could replace jobs in sectors like manufacturing, customer service, and data entry.Although Musk did not list specific roles, it is likely that jobs involving storytelling, art, caregiving, teaching, and other deeply human experiences may retain their importance. Industries such as entertainment, therapy, education, and hospitality could be among those where people remain central.In another news, Musk has once again raised alarms about plummeting global fertility rates, asserting that a 2.7 children per woman average is needed for population stability, higher than previously thought. In a recent post on X, the Tesla CEO responded to claims that women need an average of 2.7 children per woman to maintain population stability, significantly higher than the previously accepted 2.1 replacement rate.""People who have kids do need to have 3 kids to make up for those who have 0 or 1 kid or population will collapse,"" Musk wrote, sharing his mathematical calculation for maintaining global population levels.The entrepreneur's latest comments came in response to alarming fertility statistics showing the United States currently at 1.66 children per woman, while countries like Italy and Japan lag even further behind at 1.29 and 1.30 respectively. These figures fall well short of the newly proposed 2.7 threshold, which factors in variables like childlessness rates and gender distribution.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes that while artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform many industries, some jobs may remain uniquely human.

"What is China's mosquito drone? Capable of capturing images, audio & electronic signals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-mosquito-drone-capable-of-capturing-images-audio-electronic-signals-details/articleshow/122090220.cms,"Representative AI image





NEW DELHI: China showcased a miniature, insect-like drone designed for covert surveillance missions, drawing global attention and concern over its potential military and espionage uses.Developed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), the drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It was unveiled on the Chinese military broadcaster CCTV-7 as part of an exhibit on next-generation robotic systems.In a demonstration aired over the weekend, NUDT student researcher Liang Hexiang held up the ultra-light robot and said, “Here in my hand is a mosquito-like type of robot. Miniature bionic robots like this one are especially suited to information reconnaissance and special missions on the battlefield.”The drone, resembling a real mosquito, is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. It can reportedly operate silently and without radar detection, carrying ultra-miniature cameras and microphones to capture images, sounds, and electronic signals. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.According to The Defense Post, the device’s compact build enables it to evade conventional detection systems and operate in confined spaces — a feature that has raised alarms among privacy advocates and military analysts.Experts warn that such drones could be exploited for espionage, cyber intrusions, or even biological warfare.“This could mean greater access to restricted areas such as secure government facilities,” noted Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. “If China is able to produce mosquito-sized drones, it would likely be interested in using them for various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks, especially in places that larger drones struggle to access, such as indoor areas. These drones could be used to track individuals or listen in on conversations.”Other experts are raising more dystopian concerns. Tracey Follows, a futurist and former Google advisor, told The Sun that such drones could be used for “untraceable murders” or carry pathogens, referencing a Black Mirror episode in which robotic insects were weaponised for targeted killings. “In time, one expects a drone to have the situational awareness to carry out an attack autonomously without a human in the loop,” she said. “The big question is what's the payload on these drones, what are you actually attaching to the drone?”The mosquito-sized UAV is part of a broader NUDT programme exploring micro-robotics, with parallel developments including artillery-launched drones that can survive the extreme conditions of being fired from 155mm cannon shells. These innovations reflect China’s ambition to lead in micro-UAV technology, a field seeing increasing global competition.Other countries have made strides in this area. Norway’s Black Hornet, developed by Teledyne FLIR Defence, is already used by militaries worldwide. The latest version, the Black Hornet 4, won the 2025 Blue UAS Refresh award from the US Department of Defence for advancements in battery life, signal range, and wind resistance. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s RoboBee project has demonstrated insect-sized drones that can transition from water to air and even perch on surfaces using static electricity.Beyond military applications, microdrones are being explored for civilian use in medicine, agriculture, and disaster response. In healthcare, they could enable precision drug delivery or internal imaging. In environmental monitoring, their small size allows access to hazardous zones during floods, fires, or chemical spills.Still, with their stealth capabilities and growing autonomy, these tiny machines are poised to become one of the most ethically and strategically complex technologies of the decade.","The drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams.

Climate-responsive urban design such as enclosed cool spaces



Shaded walking routes



Smart mobility hubs for bicycles and e-scooters

Don’t Forget the Old Neighborhoods



Sustaining the Vision: Making 20-Minute Cities Work in the Real World

Reduced traffic congestion





Improved quality of life





Lower carbon emissions





Greater walkability and livability









Dubai is pushing forward with its ambitious goal of building “20-minute cities”: neighborhoods where residents can access 80% of their daily needs, such as work, school, shops, and parks, within a 20-minute walk, bike ride, or public transport trip. This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s upcoming “wedding of the century” in Venice was always bound to grab headlines - lavish, star-studded, and shrouded in exclusivity. But what no one saw coming? That the invitation card would steal the show and not in a good way.The multi-day extravaganza, reportedly hosting around 200 A-listers from Hollywood, tech, and politics, has already drawn fire for contributing to Venice’s overtourism crisis. Critics say it’s yet another example of billionaires turning cities into backdrops while locals are priced and pushed out.But now, the conversation has taken a turn, from too much luxury to not enough taste.ABC News obtained an image of the wedding invitation, and the internet hasn’t been the same since. The card is adorned with cartoonish doves, feathers, butterflies, shooting stars, and Venetian landmarks, gondolas and bridges included. What might have been intended as whimsical and romantic is now being dragged across X (formerly Twitter) as tacky, outdated, and, cheap-looking.“All that money and they couldn’t hire a designer?” one user said. Another took a dig by saying, “This looks like a 15-year-old made it on Canva.”Another mentioned, “Straight out of Microsoft Paint.” While an internet user quipped, “Proof that taste cannot be bought.”Some even joked it looked like AI-generated clip art, with one user saying, “Did Bezos ask ChatGPT to design this in 30 seconds?”While Bezos has spent the last year flaunting his new $500 million yacht, “Koru”, and planning a celebration fit for royalty, the humble invite has become the internet’s latest obsession, and not in the way the couple likely intended.But perhaps the irony is poetic: In an age where billionaires are building space rockets and planning underwater internet cables, it turns out the real rocket fuel for the public imagination is still... a bad wedding card.As the festivities gear up in Venice, it’s unclear whether Bezos will respond to the invite backlash. But one thing is certain, the internet RSVP’d with a resounding: “This could’ve been prettier.”","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s upcoming “wedding of the century’ in Venice was always bound to grab headlines.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

In a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter), USCIS shared an image that read: “Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law.” The agency said it will cancel green cards and visas for people found guilty of serious crimes, like supporting or promoting terrorism,a stark reminder that staying in the US is a conditional privilege, not a guaranteed right.In its X post, the agency stated: “Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege.

Microsoft ’s plans for its next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) chip, code-named Maia, are reportedly facing a significant setback. According to The Information, citing sources involved in the effort, the chip's mass production has been delayed by at least six months, now pushing its rollout into 2026 instead of the anticipated 2025.When “Braga,” as the chip is also known, eventually enters production, its performance is expected to fall considerably short of Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which was released late last year, the report said.Microsoft had initially aimed to integrate the Maia chip into its data centers as early as this year. However, design changes, staffing constraints and high employee turnover are cited as key factors contributing to the delay.Like its major tech counterparts, Microsoft has been heavily investing in developing custom processors for AI operations and general-purpose applications. This move is intended to lessen the tech giant's dependence on expensive chips from Nvidia, which currently dominates the AI hardware market .Cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet’s Google have also been pursuing in-house chip development, tailoring processors to their specific needs with the dual goals of boosting performance and cutting costs. Microsoft first introduced the Maia chip in November 2023 but has since lagged behind its peers in scaling up its production.In contrast, Google has seen success with its custom AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In April, Google unveiled its seventh-generation AI chip, designed to accelerate the performance of AI applications.Similarly, Amazon in December revealed its next-generation AI chip, Trainium 3, which is slated for release later this year.Meanwhile, Nvidia is also expected to announce its next-generation chips later this year. One of the biggest competitors of Nvidia, AMD has also announced new chips that are claimed to offer better performance than Nvidia’s Blackwell chips.","Maia chip's mass production has been delayed by at least six months, now pushing its rollout into 2026 instead of the anticipated 2025.

Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has lost a senior executive from its generative artificial intelligence division, a report has said. Vasi Philomin, a key vice president overseeing generative AI development and the company's Bedrock service, has left the company. Philomin, who had been with Amazon for eight years, confirmed his move to another company via email to news agency Reuters.Philomin played a crucial role in leading AWS's generative AI efforts, product strategy, and oversaw the development of Amazon's foundation models known as Amazon Titan. He played aninstrumental role in creating and leading Amazon Bedrock , a central hub for utilising various AI models and a flagship product in AWS's quest for AI dominance.Philomin was also a regular speaker at major AWS events, including the company's annual cloud computing conference in Las Vegas.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed his departure earlier in June and stated that Rajesh Sheth, a vice president formerly in charge of Amazon Elastic Block Store, has assumed some of Philomin's responsibilities. The spokesperson also noted that other vice presidents at AWS are actively working on generative AI projects.This high-profile exit comes as Amazon intensifies its efforts to bolster its standing in the rapidly evolving AI development landscape. Rivals like OpenAI and Google have gained an early lead, particularly with consumer-focused AI models.To compete, the Seattle-based tech giant has made huge investments, including an $8 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic. This partnership has led to the integration of Anthropic's Claude software into Amazon’s own products, notably a revamped version of its voice assistant Alexa , which is being rolled out to customers this year.Amazon has also been expanding its own AI model portfolio, introducing Nova AI models for text, video, and image generation in December, and later adding Sonic for natural-sounding speech this year.","Vasi Philomin, a key vice president overseeing generative AI development and the company's Bedrock service, has left the company.

After a period of four decades, Microsoft is officially bidding farewell to the iconic ""Blue Screen of Death"" (BSoD). Microsoft is now replacing the famous Blue error screen with a redesigned and black interface. The company revealed that the change is part of a broader ‘ Windows Resiliency Initiative ’ which is aimed at making the operating system more robust.The company announced the change in Windows blog post. The company said that with this change it aims to modernise and improve the user experience. The company also wishes to reduce the disruption caused by system crashes. The new screen for Windows comes with a simplified message which does not consists of the sad-face emoji and QR code as it aligns with Windows 11’s design language.“We’re introducing a simplified user interface (UI) that pairs with the shortened experience. The updated UI improves readability and aligns better with Windows 11 design principles, while preserving the technical information on the screen for when it is needed,” said the company.The simplified UI for unexpected restarts will be available starting later this summer on all Windows 11, version 24H2 devices. In the case of consecutive unexpected restarts, devices can get stuck in the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), impacting productivity and often requiring IT teams to spend significant time troubleshooting and restoring affected devices.The Windows update comes a year after Crowdstrike outage , which impacted over 8 million Windows devices globally. Many of the affected devices showed the dreaded blue screen. In response, Microsoft launched the Windows Resiliency Initiative to embed deeper security and recovery features into the OS.“This is where quick machine recovery (QMR) can help. When a widespread outage affects devices from starting properly, Microsoft can broadly deploy targeted remediations to affected devices via Windows RE—automating fixes with QMR and quickly getting users to a productive state without requiring complex manual intervention from IT,” added Microsoft.The Black Screen of Death will roll out with Windows 11 version 24H2 later this summer.",Microsoft is replacing the famous Blue error screen with a redesigned and black interface.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

How Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen built their marriage on trust and acceptance of each other’s pasts?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-tom-brady-and-gisele-bndchen-built-their-marriage-on-trust-and-acceptance-of-each-others-pasts/articleshow/122112477.cms,"Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen open up on embracing past relationships (Getty Images)

What Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have shared about navigating love, marriage, and mutual respect



Why Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen's Marriage Failed | How You Can Avoid It in Your Marriage

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen didn’t just form a power couple in the public eye—they built a deeply personal partnership rooted in mutual respect, trust, and a shared willingness to accept each other’s pasts. While their love story began in 2007 and spanned over a decade, the foundation they created speaks volumes about the emotional depth and resilience of their bond.From the beginning, their connection went far beyond fame and glamour. Brady, an NFL icon, and Bündchen, a globally recognized Victoria’s Secret supermodel, came together with a shared commitment to growing a family and supporting one another through life’s unpredictable turns. Despite their intensely busy careers, they remained each other’s pillars of strength, navigating challenges side-by-side. Whether it was Bündchen cheering Brady on from the sidelines or Brady publicly recognizing her sacrifices, the couple worked hard to nurture their relationship amid extraordinary pressure.But the heart of their relationship wasn't just built on love—it was shaped by an understanding of each other’s unique life experiences.In a 2019 Men’s Health cover story, Brady opened up about how Bündchen’s unconventional upbringing challenged and inspired him.“Gisele's life has been very nontraditional. She left home when she was 14; she lived in Japan at 16 in an era with no cell phones. She lived in New York at 17 without speaking English,” he explained, offering a rare glimpse into the factors that shaped her bold worldview.What struck Brady the most was how her background influenced her perspective on life’s expectations. “In her mind, there are no boundaries. ‘Why can't you do that? Why do you have to go to school? Why can't you just leave and live in a different country?’” he said. “In her reality, you can.”Coming from a traditional background himself, Brady admitted he had to reevaluate his own beliefs. “This is what you do: You go to elementary school, you go to college,” he said. But it was Bündchen’s free-spirited nature that pushed him to grow. “And you know what, she's right,” he added. “I'm the one that had to go, ‘You're right!’ And that's helped me grow.”Even though their marriage eventually ended in 2022, the way they embraced each other’s differences remains a lasting example of what it means to build a relationship based on empathy, growth, and acceptance. While Brady’s retirement may have come too late to save their marriage, the emotional legacy they share continues to inspire. Their journey proves that love isn't just about compatibility—it's about evolving together.Also Read: What made Tom Brady say yes to the Netflix roast?

Anthony Richardson shows big arm power at age eight

Anthony Richardson’s early talent predicts NFL Success

Also Read:

There are still people amazed by Anthony Richardson's throw at just eight years old. He threw a football over 40 yards in the air while playing catch with his friends in Gainesville, Florida. It was not designed or coached, just instinct.That powerful throw showed how strong his arm was, even as a kid. Years later, that moment is being talked about again as Anthony Richardson shines in the NFL. Many now say that backyard throw was the first sign of the talent he’s showing with the Indianapolis Colts.When he was eight, young Anthony Richardson lived in Gainesville, Florida. One afternoon in his backyard, he picked up a youth-size football and threw it over 40 yards in the air—without much effort. His dad, Anthony Richardson Sr., was there and said he felt shocked and proud. Local coaches who saw it said the throw was something they’d never seen from a kid that age.Most children at that age can’t throw more than 20 yards, but Anthony Richardson made it look easy. His form was smooth and natural, even without training. The throw quickly became the talk of the neighborhood. His older cousins shared the story, and soon youth coaches started paying attention.After that day, Anthony Richardson began playing football more seriously. Coaches invited him to teams early and remembered how rare his talent was. Looking back now, that single throw feels like the moment everyone realized Anthony Richardson had something special.Now, in 2025, Anthony Richardson plays for the Indianapolis Colts after being drafted in the first round. Scouts often mention the same childhood throw when they talk about his arm strength. NFL draft reports say Anthony Richardson has a cannon arm and can make big plays across the field.This moment from his youth ties directly into what fans see on NFL Sundays. Coaches also share that his early talent helped him adapt fast to college and pro football.In April 2023, when the Indianapolis Colts drafted Anthony Richardson, they mentioned his unique arm power and its ability to change games. Now, everyone reflects back to the 40-yard throw as the moment it began. His childhood moment is a straightforward narrative, but the implication about how far he can go is profound.","Anthony Richardson threw a football over 40 yards in the air while playing catch with his friends in Gainesville, Florida.

Note:

The latest story update of Assassin’s Creed Shadows introduces a charismatic ally, Rufino, through A Critical Encounter quest. The multi-stage mission expands the League’s fight against Templars. To unlock the ally, the players must navigate sabotage, infiltration, and decisive eliminations. With success comes more powerful game rewards and some valuable new companions. Here is the complete breakdown of how to tackle the quest in an effective way.Completing Way of the Blacksmith's main quest and having access to Yasuke, head right to the hideout. Near the southeast entrance, look carefully. Ruffino is not immediately obvious. He remains concealed in the nearby foliage. His position can be revealed by the objective marker hovering above bushes. To interact with him will begin A Critical Encounter quest.Rufino explains the connection he has with Tomiko, his ally and immediate threat—sensitive Templar research or the Templar-linked group that operates near Osaka. He then tasks Yasuke and Naoe with the destruction.
