NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: In a move to track the origin and manufacturing of all batteries and help consumers get details of their life and performance, the govt has come up with proposed guidelines for Battery Pack Aadhaar Number (BPAN). Under this, every battery pack will have machine-readable, 21-character alphanumeric code and QR code storing all such details.The digital framework, which will work like a “battery passport”, is aimed at tracking batteries across their entire lifecycle, from manufacturing and use to recycling and disposal. While the guidelines focus exclusively on Electric Vehicle (EV) applications, they would be extended to industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2 kWh at a later stage. “Starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries and portable batteries are outside the scope of this document,” the draft guidelines said.On July 8, TOI had first reported the govt’s plan to have such a framework, after a series of incidents of electric two-wheelers catching fire stressed its importance.As per the proposed guidelines, the alphanumeric or QR code will contain static data such as battery material, descriptor and carbon footprint parameters, which will be accessible to public.This data remains unchanged unless there is a physical replacement of components or modification of the battery’s operational parameters by its management system.The battery’s dynamic data will be stored, maintained and updated via a server. It will give real-time insights into the battery's performance and health. Among the most critical of these parameters are the battery status, battery category, and State of Health (SOH). This will be accessible only to service provider, recycler, producer and authorised stakeholders.This additional feature would increase the battery cost by barely Rs 10 per unit compared to Rs 900 in Europe.Officials said that after finalisation of the framework, govt will come up with standards, with accountability being defined for each stakeholder in the entire chain. An official said this single move will further three major goals: trade (export of electric vehicles), safety and quality.Preeti Bajaj, CEO and MD, Luminous Power Technologies, called it a pivotal shift for India’s battery ecosystem, creating lifecycle transparency from manufacturing to end-of-life recycling. “This will further streamline quality assurance, boost traceability and support compliance with evolving global norms, while catalysing a more structured circular economy. The framework mirrors global thinking, as seen in initiatives such as Europe’s Battery Passport, positioning Indian manufacturers for future regulatory alignment, exports and responsible growth,” she said.While larger batteries used in mobility and energy storage are well positioned to adopt the changes at scale, implementation might be a bit complex for small-format batteries and low-capacity storage systems (below 3 kVA), particularly due to the need for physical identifiers like QR codes, Bajaj said.","The digital framework, which will work like a “battery passport”, is aimed at tracking batteries across their entire lifecycle.

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules.

How Neuro-sama’s technology, consistency, and timing fueled an unprecedented rise





An unprecedented achievement on Twitch has now become a focus for many fans. For the first time, the most subscribed streamer on the platform is an entry no one could have imagined. An AI-powered VTuber named Neuro-sama has surged and taken over every creator on Twitch, overtaking Jynxzi, who was the placeholder before.Streaming on the Vedal987 channel, Neuro-sama now sits comfortably at the top, leaving some of the biggest names far behind. As of January 2, 2026, Neuro-sama holds an estimated 162,459 active subscribers, according to TwitchTracker. That number places the channel far ahead of second-place streamer Jynxzi, who sits at just under 74,000 subscribers.Neuro-sama is the creation of Vedal, a computer programmer who built the VTuber using Unity and C#, with the AI systems developed in Python. Unlike regular chatbots, Neuro-sama can carry on conversations, sing, react to videos, and play games. She can stream almost around the clock, 24/7, offering viewers constant engagement, and not experiencing any kind of fatigue like normal streamers.According to the Neuro-sama wiki, “All of her movements, speech, and gameplay are powered by different generative AI systems to emulate a human streamer’s actions and interactions with her viewers.”With subscriptions valued at $5 each, not counting ads, bits, donations, or sponsorships, the channel is likely generating over $400,000 per month from subscriptions alone.Jynxzi addressed the surprising achievement on a recent stream when he became aware he had been taken over, saying, “You’re saying Vedal987 is not real? I’ve never even heard of that. That is the future of streaming bro. Dude, I’m bewildered bro. Game is game, I guess. 158,000 gifted subscriptions to an artificial intelligence VTuber that non-stop, 24/7 streams.”Neuro-Sama first appeared in 2019 as a simple osu! bot before being relaunched in late 2022 as a full-fledged VTuber.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether.

Why iPhone 18 may not launch in 2026





Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the fall event.“For more than a decade, Apple has introduced its mainline ‌iPhone‌ lineup in the fall, with all core models launching simultaneously in September,” MacRumors reported. “That pattern is expected to change this year, when the company is widely rumored to split its upcoming ‌iPhone‌ releases across two distinct release windows rather than unveiling the entire lineup at once. Under this strategy, Apple is expected to prioritize higher-end models in the fall while delaying lower-cost or standard models until the following year,” the report says.According to the report, iPhone 18 may not arrive until the spring of 2027, leaving the ‌iPhone 17‌ “as the latest standard model for over 18 months.” To recall, iPhone 17 debuted in September 2025 along with other iPhone 17 series models. “This would mark the first time Apple skips an entire calendar year without releasing a new generation of its flagship non-Pro ‌iPhone‌,” it says.MacRumours says that the rumoured change is likely due to Apple’s expanding iPhone lineup. Apple introduced iPhone 16e and iPhone Air last year. The company is rumoured to bring its first foldable iPhone in 2026. With the continued presence of iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, there could be at least eight iPhone models on sale by the end of 2026 (considering Apple’s next iPhone lineup continues to include – iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPhone 18).“A staggered release schedule would allow the company to further differentiate its models, give them a longer sales window without internal competition, and spread ‌iPhone‌ launches more evenly across the year,” the report says.According to supply chain analysts, the rumoured shift will also result in manufacturing and logistics benefits for the iPhone maker. “By spacing out launches, Apple could reduce production bottlenecks, better manage component supply for advanced technologies, and smooth revenue recognition across fiscal quarters rather than concentrating ‌iPhone‌ sales in a single period,” the report adds.","Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable iPhone during the fall event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126298729,imgsize-32448,width-400,resizemode-4/iphone-17.jpg"
Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Elon Musk's Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore! We already have some amazing researchers and engineers there, buoyed now by the 100-strong Manus team, and we’re growing fast,” Wang said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Feel free to DM with a resumé if interested!,” he added.In the memo, Alexandr Wang writes:","Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids.

Q: How can I start career cushioning?

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

One of the world's biggest mathematicians Joel David Hamkins says AI models are basically zero help for mathematics as they produce…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/technology-news/one-of-the-worlds-biggest-mathematicians-joel-david-hamkins-says-ai-models-are-basically-zero-help-for-mathematics-as-they-produce/articleshow/126316572.cms,"Renowned mathematician Joel David Hamkins has voiced strong doubts about large language models' utility in mathematical research, calling their outputs ""garbage"" and ""not mathematically correct."" He highlights AI's frustrating tendency to confidently assert incorrectness and resist correction, mirroring unproductive human interactions. Despite AI's benchmark successes, Hamkins finds current systems unreliable for genuine research collaboration.

AI's confident incorrectness mirrors frustrating human interactions

Growing gap between AI benchmarks and real-world research applications





Joel David Hamkins, a leading mathematician and logic professor at the University of Notre Dame, has fired a withering salvo at large language models in mathematical research. He refers to them as being fundamentally useless to support mathematical work, noting that they give “garbage answers that are not mathematically correct. ”Speaking on the Lex Fridman podcast, Hamkins shared his frustration with current AI systems despite experimenting with various paid models. ""I've played around with it and I've tried experimenting, but I haven't found it helpful at all,"" he stated bluntly.What troubles Hamkins most isn't the occasional mathematical slip so much as the way the AI systems react to being corrected. When he points out concrete flaws in their reasoning, the models answer with feisty assurances like ""Oh, it's totally fine."" This pattern—confident but incorrect responses coupled with resistance to correction—erodes the collaborative trust that underpins mathematical dialogue.""If I were having such an experience with a person, I would simply refuse to talk to that person again,"" Hamkins explained, emphasizing that the AI's conduct parallels counterproductive human interactions he would avoid.Hamkins' critique comes as the mathematical community has a mixed response to what AI is capable of.Some researchers have announced breakthroughs with the help of AI tackling problems from the Erdos collection; others, like the mathematician Terrence Tao, caution that AI produces perfect-looking proofs with subtle mistakes no human reviewer would allow. The assessment explicitly states a critical tension: impressive performance on standardized tests doesn't translate to practical utility for domain experts.The assessment reveals a critical tension: impressive performance on standardized tests doesn't translate to practical utility for domain experts. ""As far as mathematical reasoning is concerned, it seems not reliable,"" Hamkins concluded.Though he acknowledges future AI systems might improve, Hamkins remains skeptical about current capabilities. His experience serves as a sobering reminder that AI companies' heavy investments in reasoning capabilities haven't yet bridged the gap between benchmark performance and serving as genuine research partners for working mathematicians.","Joel David Hamkins, a leading mathematician and logic professor at the University of Notre Dame, has fired a withering salvo at large language models in mathematical research.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

The Great Indian Kapil Show,





Indian comedy superstar Kapil Sharma is not just making audiences laugh on screen, he’s now serving up comfort food and café vibes in the Middle East. On December 31, 2025, the comedian and television personality opened Kap’s Cafe in Dubai, marking the hospitality brand’s first foray into the Middle East after earlier launching its first international location in Surrey, Canada.Kap’s Cafe Dubai is not your typical coffee spot. The interior design leans into pastel-heavy hues, muted greens and soft pinks with plush seating and statement lighting, creating a space that is both Instagram-friendly and comfortably familiar. The décor is inspired by the visual language ofthe Netflix hit hosted by Sharma that has become one of India’s most watched comedy series globally, giving fans a sense of walking into the show’s world itself.In social media clips shared by the comedian, Sharma appears smiling, greeting visitors and even serving coffee, much like a host welcoming guests into his home, fitting the café’s relaxed and “comfort first” ethos.While the full Dubai menu has not been officially launched yet, early previews suggest a selection rooted in comfort-driven café classics. Fans can likely expect a mix of Indian and Western favourites, similar to the offerings at the Canada location, including:The inclusion of jaggery-infused lime juice, in particular, gives the café a signature drink that speaks to Sharma’s roots and personal taste, making the experience feel less like a corporate chain and more like a beloved local hangout with celebrity charm.The Dubai café opened its doors from 4 pm to midnight on New Year’s Eve, positioning itself as a cosy alternative to the city’s louder nightlife and a welcoming space for Delhi-to-Dubai travellers, fans of the Netflix series and coffee lovers alike. Located in the Al Kifaf area, Kap’s Cafe joins a growing list of celebrity-linked hospitality ventures in the UAE, a market known for its diverse food scene and appetite for global flavours.Kap’s Cafe’s expansion comes amid a backdrop of challenges for the brand. Last year, the Canada location in Surrey made headlines after facing multiple shooting incidents, including three attacks over several months in 2025. Despite these setbacks, the Dubai launch demonstrates Sharma’s resilience and confidence in growing his hospitality venture internationally.The Dubai opening does not just reflect a culinary expansion, it illustrates how celebrities are blending entertainment, personal branding and lifestyle experiences. By drawing inspiration froma Netflix series that has gained traction and viewership across borders, Kap’s Cafe lets fans step into the world of their favourite comedian, turning casual dining into a form of pop-culture engagement.In a city famed for megaprojects and world-class dining, Kap’s Cafe stands out by offering a comfortable, personality-driven space that promises laughter, nostalgia and heartwarming food, all wrapped in the vibe of one of India’s most iconic comedy voices.","Kapil Sharma opened Kap's Cafe in Dubai on December 31, 2025.

Why are UAE banks ending SMS OTPs?

SIM-Swapping: Criminals trick mobile providers into porting your number to their SIM card, effectively ""stealing"" your identity and receiving your OTPs directly.

Phishing Scams: Fraudsters create fake websites that look exactly like your bank or a delivery service, tricking you into typing your OTP into their hands.

Interception: Advanced hackers can sometimes intercept SMS messages as they travel through the air using outdated ""SS7"" protocols.

What are in-app approvals?



The Trigger: You click ""Pay"" on a shopping website or app.

Why should you act now?





If you’ve lived in the UAE for a while, the ""ping"" of an incoming SMS with a six-digit code has been the soundtrack to your online shopping. But that sound is about to become a relic of the past. Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via text message for online card payments.This isn't just a minor update; it’s a full-scale security revolution mandated by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). For years, SMS codes were the gold standard for two-factor authentication, but as hackers became more sophisticated, the ""weak links"" in the SMS system became too big to ignore.By shifting to a mobile-first approach, the UAE is positioning itself as a global leader in protecting its residents' hard-earned money.The primary reason for this change is simple: Security. While SMS is convenient, it travels over open telecommunications networks that were never designed for high-stakes banking.This made them prime targets for three specific types of fraud:According to industry reports, SMS-related fraud caused billions in global losses.In the UAE alone, scams saw a significant jump in recent years, prompting the Central Bank to issue Notice 2025/3057, which effectively bans SMS and email OTPs as a standalone security method.The future of banking in the UAE is ""In-App Authentication."" Instead of waiting for a text and manually typing in a code, the process is now much faster and more integrated. Here is what your next online purchase will look like:This ""closed-loop"" system ensures that the person approving the transaction is physically holding the trusted device. It removes the need for the telephone network entirely, which is also a massive win for travelers who often struggle to receive SMS codes while roaming.This isn’t just a technical update, it affects every resident who shops online or uses digital banking in the UAE.How to prepare:Once SMS OTPs are phased out, you won’t be able to approve online card purchases using text codes. Transactions will be declined unless verified through the bank app. This change also means that iPhone or Android users must ensure their device settings allow notifications from their bank app.If you haven’t already switched to app-based authentication, banks generally recommend doing so well before the deadline to avoid disruptions.This step is part of a larger plan led by the Central Bank of the UAE to strengthen digital banking infrastructure. Regulators have mandated that banks phase out SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, although many instituted the change early.The goal is to reduce fraud and align with global best practices, as digital fraud patterns evolve. By moving to in-app authentication with biometric verification and encrypted channels, banks aim to create a more secure, convenient and unified payment experience for customers.","Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords via text message for online card payments.

The Silicon Shrink, How Artificial Intelligence Made The World An Asylum.

.





AI in psychiatry is expected to deliver big – “whatever ails psychiatry, AI promises a cure” – writes Daniel Oberhaus inBig tech, not just startups, has been developing digital phenotypes – using AI to parse how people interact with their phones and devices to reveal clues about their mental health. AI is expected to be the ‘wonder drug’ with its access to immense data that’ll help various types of AI apps improve diagnosis, treatment and patient outcomes.But this is flawed, argues Oberhaus whose central claim is that contemporary approaches to AI in psychiatry cannot deliver because they operate on the basis of “unreliable and invalid conceptions of mental disorder.” Little is known about ‘biological origins’ of mental disorders. We know the what and how in psychiatry, but not the why . So, Oberhaus says, how can psychiatric AI (PAI) diagnose and treat mental disorders better than doctors by analysing big data created from flawed criteria? PAI won’t improve psychiatry – it’ll just automate and amplify its existing problems on a massive scale. The book warns this’ll lead to widespread overdiagnosis, causing millions to receive medication/ therapy for conditions they may not actually have. You may well ask, but how is psychiatry ‘unreliable’?Oberhaus has dug deep, starting with his sister. The happy little girl’s behaviour changed after a schoolrelated traumatic incident.Several psychiatrists “treated” her, but nothing helped. Multiple diagnoses/ treatments later, she had asked the latest shrink: “What’s your plan for me?” Oberhaus says talking endlessly about her problems and having her down medications did not help at all. Her last sketch was a “crudely drawn person” with a stack of boxes over her head, each with a label: abandonment, eating disorders, OCD, anxiety, lack of friends, sex issues, borderline personality disorder, learning issues. Below this, she had scrawled: “No one knows what this is.”There is still no definite definition for mental ‘dysfunction’ – just that it isn’t yet a ‘disorder’, nor a ‘disease’. What counts as dysfunction? Who decides? Dysfunction is departure from normal functioning. But what does ‘normal’ look like? The book says definitions alone show that diagnosis for conditions seen as ‘disorders’ is basis symptomatic behaviour alone. There are almost 230 different ways to be diagnosed with depression and over 6L possible symptom combinations for PTSD. So, treatment is largely subjective judgment of the psychiatrist.Imagine now AI glugging in all the mega data around PTSD alone. Data goes in, a solution pops out. There is no step-by-step explanation to why this solution. How a maps app works out your route may not matter, but it is essential to know the why behind an AI diagnosis/ therapy.The idea of PAI, argues Oberhaus, should be to improve patient outcomes and not pathologise all human behaviour. Psychiatry is “throwing solutions at a wall to see what would stick.” What can improvePAI is open data, explainable algos, and regulation for using AI in psychiatry. Till then, PAI will only magnify the weaknesses of current psychiatric diagnosis.",Daniel Oberhaus argues that contemporary approaches to AI in psychiatry cannot deliver because they operate on the basis of ‘unreliable and invalid conceptions of mental disorder’ Little is known about ‘biological origins’ of mental disorders. Oberhaus says PAI won’t improve psychiatry – it’ll just automate and amplify its existing problems.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126315939,imgsize-61006,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720.jpg"

A new horizon for political style?

Designer perspectives and global relevance of Zohran Mamdani's style

The takeaway: Zohran Mamdani's style with substance





As the new mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani , took the oath on January 1, 2026, headlines across politics and culture praised his historic win. Yet one detail stood out in fashion circles, long after the ceremonies ended and it was the Assamese eri silk tie that he chose to wear.In an era where political figures increasingly use fashion as a form of cultural expression and personal storytelling, Mamdani’s choice became more than a sartorial statement. It became a symbol of identity, heritage and global style influence.While many inaugurations lean toward traditional Western tailoring that includes navy suits, plain ties and crisp white shirts, Mamdani’s look introduced a multilayered narrative. The tie, crafted from eri silk, highlighted a fabric traditionally woven in the Indian state of Assam, prized for its rich texture, subtle sheen and ethical production methods.Unlike the more commonly known mulberry silk, eri silk comes from a variety of silkworm that feed on castor leaves, making the textile cruelty-free and environmentally considerate, a factor that aligns with sustainability trends steadily gaining ground in fashion.This was not just a random sartorial choice. Mamdani’s tie became a fashion headline because it represented a fusion of regional craftsmanship with metropolitan elegance, a bridge between local tradition and global modernity.What made Mamdani’s sartorial choice even more resonant in fashion and cultural circles was the story behind the tie itself. For his swearing-in, Mamdani wore the custom, gold-embroidered tie made from Assamese eri silk by New Delhi menswear label Kartik Research, founded by designer Kartik Kumra.The brand is celebrated for its artisanal approach and engagement with Indian craft traditions. The delicate four-petal floral motifs on the herringbone necktie nodded subtly to Assamese weaving techniques, bringing India’s Northeast textile heritage into one of the most photographed civic moments of the year.Styled by Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, Mamdani’s incorporation of eri silk, also known as ahimsa or non-violent silk, produced across Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland, was not just a fashion choice. It was a quiet celebration of craftsmanship and sustainable, culturally rooted design on the global stage.In fashion today, heritage and cultural craftsmanship are increasingly prized. Designers and stylists have been tapping into artisanal textiles not only for their aesthetic appeal but also for the stories they carry. From Japanese kasuri to African kente cloth, fashion tastemakers are spotlighting local techniques with global resonance.Mamdani’s eri silk tie tapped right into this moment. Wearing it to one of the most photographed public ceremonies in the world was not just stylish, it was a fashion-forward cultural assertion.The tie captured attention of fashion commentariat and soon enough, social media platforms lit up as it defied inauguration norms. Most political wardrobe choices stay safely within neutral palettes but Mamdani's eri silk tie with its subtle texture and cultural depth stood out as refreshingly distinctive yet still elegant and dignified.It spotlighted sustainable materials. In an industry increasingly focused on ecological impact, silk alternatives and ethically produced textiles are trending. Eri silk’s cruelty-free provenance resonates with consumers and designers alike. The tie also offered a narrative depth as fashion has moved beyond aesthetics to storytelling. Mamdani’s tie was a conversation starter about identity, heritage and inclusive representation, all within a highly photographed, global moment.Political wardrobes have long been dissected for symbolism, from Michelle Obama’s designer choices to Barack Obama’s flag-pin ties. Mamdani’s eri silk accessory suggests that global political figures are now embracing authentic, culturally specific fashion as part of their public persona.This shift parallels developments in contemporary fashion, which is a move away from homogenous corporate dress codes and towards diversity, narrative and craft. It is not merely about looking good but showing something meaningful.Fashion insiders noted that such statements resonate especially in 2026, an era where cultural heritage is increasingly integrated into luxury fashion lines. Sustainability is a non-negotiable value among fashion consumers and global audiences expect public figures to reflect diversity and depth in personal style. The eri silk tie did exactly that, acting as a small yet powerful medium for cross-cultural dialogue.In a world saturated with trending garments and seasonal must-haves, it is rare for a single accessory at a political moment to generate genuine fashion buzz. Zohran Mamdani’s Assamese eri silk tie achieved that, not because it was flashy but because it was intentional with a thoughtful blend of culture, sustainability and modern elegance.","Zohran Mamdani wore an Assamese eri silk tie for his swearing-in as New York City mayor.

In a bid to make railway travel more convenient and comfortable, the Indian Railways has introduced modern sleeping pods at Guntur Railway Station in Andhra Pradesh. The official announcement was made by the Ministry of Railways on the social media platform X. It will be a safe, hygienic, and affordable resting option for travellers in long-transit or waiting for their trains.India Railways is the heart of millions of passengers who travel on trains on a regular basis. But because of waiting time and in-between connectivity, passengers had to wait on the platform. It has long been a challenge, mostly for budget and solo travellers. And that’s why the ministry decided to launch these sleeping pods which will address all these issues and offer short-stay accommodation within the station premises itself and that too in just INR 150!Let’s understand this better:The sleeping pods are basically capsule-style accommodation. These take less space and are similar to those at airports and transit hubs in several international destinations. These pods are designed for those who need a few hours of rest rather than a full hotel stay and burning a hole in the pocket.There are 64 beds, available for single and double occupancy. There are also pods dedicated for women passengers and families.Passengers can find these pods on Platform No. 1 near Gate No. 3. These are also extremely easily accessible.For those on overnight journeys, senior citizens, families with kids, or passengers dealing with long delays, the availability of a quiet and secure resting space can change the way of travelling.These sleeping pods are more than just a bed. These are replete with essential amenities such as fresh sheets, air-conditioning, Wi-Fi, charging points and washrooms. There’s also hot water facilities. Some other features include lockers and refreshment options. Work desks are also there for business travellers. The main aim is to keep these spaces clean and neat and safe.These are budget-friendly facilities and are designed for common travellers.For Single pods: ₹150 for 3 hoursExtended stays of up to 24 hours are also available at modest rates.Double pods and private room options cater to couples, families, or travellers seeking additional privacy.This flexible pricing structure allows passengers to choose accommodation based on their waiting time and comfort needs.The launch at Guntur is not an isolated development. Indian Railways has already introduced similar sleeping pod facilities at stations such as Visakhapatnam and Charlapalli. The reviews are positive. These initiatives fall under the Non-Fare Revenue model. As railway stations evolve into multi-service transit hubs, facilities like sleeping pods are expected to expand to more busy junctions across India.The introduction of sleeping pods is a significant shift in how rail travel is being reimagined in India. For travellers, on long-distance journeys, this comes as a welcoming comforting move.","Indian Railways has introduced modern sleeping pods at Guntur Railway Station in Andhra Pradesh.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ advice to young people





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has revealed the single and most important factor behind the company’s trillion-dollar success: “obsessive, compulsive focus on the customer” rather than on competitors. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, Bezos stressed on the fact that many of the CEOs and founders claim that they prioritise customers but in reality they spend most of their time in keeping a close watch on their rivals. “It is a huge advantage to any company if you can stay focused on your customer instead of your competitor,” he said.Amazon’s career page lists 14 leadership principles and ‘customer obsession’ tops the list. The philosophy urges leaders to “start with the customer and work backwards” to earn and keep trust. Bezos feels that it is always important to identify your true customer. “It is a huge advantage to any company if you can stay focused on your customer instead of your competitor. So then you have to identify who is your customer,” said Bezos.At the Washington Post, for example, he said the customer is the reader, not advertisers.“Advertisers want to be where there are readers. So, it’s really not complicated,” he noted.Bezos pointed to Amazon Prime as a prime example of customer‑driven innovation. Launched in 2005 with free and fast shipping, the service was initially criticized as “too good to be true.” Yet its focus on consumer needs proved transformative.Jeff Bezos shared an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has revealed the single and most important factor behind the company’s trillion-dollar success: ‘customer obsession’ Bezos stressed on the fact that many of the CEOs and founders claim that they prioritise customers but in reality they spend most of their time in keeping a close watch on their rivals. “It is a huge advantage to any company if you can stay focused on your customer instead of your competitor,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126316721,imgsize-20168,width-400,resizemode-4/wealth-quote-of-the-day-by-jeff-bezos-your-margin-is-my-opportunity-what-is-bezoss-regret-minimization-framework-the-decision-framework-behind-a-25-trillion-global-powerhouse.jpg"

Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year’s Eve celebration. The centerpiece, as always, is the Burj Khalifa, where Emaar has planned a record-breaking fusion of pyrotechnics, LED light displays, and synchronized fountain shows. This year, the ""Brightest Show on Earth"" will feature a new laser choreography designed to be visible from miles away.Dubai’s New Year’s Eve fireworks display is set to be one of the most spectacular globally, with the Burj Khalifa and Downtown Dubai as the centerpiece. Fireworks will light up the skyline starting at midnight, with a staggering 48 fireworks displays across 40 approved locations. While the Burj Khalifa remains the ""Main Event"" with its record-breaking laser and pyrotechnic show titled, there are plenty of other world-class spots to ring in the New Year.Getting into central Downtown Dubai requires a tactical plan as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) implements a massive, phased closure strategy. To keep the city moving, authorities will begin shutting down major road arteries as early as 4:00 PM on December 31..The RTA strongly advises residents and tourists to reach their destinations before 4:00 PM. Once a road is closed, it will remain closed until well after the fireworks end, usually until 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM on January 1, to allow for the safe dispersal of millions of spectators.If you are planning to head to the Burj Khalifa area, the Dubai Metro is your best friend, but it comes with specific rules. The Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station is expected to close or become ""exit-only"" as early as 5:00 PM to prevent overcrowding on the platforms. If you arrive after this time, you will likely be redirected to the Financial Centre or Business Bay stations.To bridge the gap, the RTA is deploying a fleet of over 200 ""shuttle buses"" that will transport visitors from remote parking lots (like Al Wasl and Al Jafiliya) to the Downtown area for free. Taxis will be in high demand, and ""Dubai Taxi"" and Uber/Careem will have designated pick-up zones, though wait times can exceed two hours after the clock strikes twelve. Using a Nol card with a balance of at least AED 20 is essential to avoid long queues at ticket machines.","Dubai is set to reclaim its crown for the world’s most dazzling New Year's Eve celebration.

Ask Dhirendra: 'How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/mutual-funds/ask-dhirendra-how-do-i-decide-how-much-to-save-and-invest-when-my-income-is-just-about-enough/articleshow/126072787.cms,"The problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save. (AI image)

“How do I decide how much to save and invest when my income is just about enough?”

What can you save today without breaking your life? How can you make that number grow every year?

Where does a typical salary go?

Some expenses are non-negotiable (rent, basic food, fees).

Some are negotiable but important (a modest phone, occasional eating out).

Some are pure leakage (unused subscriptions, impulsive orders, “I don’t even remember what this was”).

From spare change to serious money

Step up your SIP before you step up your lifestyle

First, add up your genuine essentials: rent/EMI, groceries, utilities, fees, basic transport.

Next, be realistic and add a modest amount for discretionary spending that you know you’ll do anyway – because you are human, not a robot.

See what is left. From that leftover, commit to a percentage – even 10% of your take-home income – as a non-negotiable saving and investing amount. Set up automatic transfers and SIPs for that right after your salary date.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

This is one of those questions that sounds technical, but is actually very emotional.On paper, it’s simple: income comes in, expenses go out, and whatever is left is “savings. In real life, income comes in, rent, EMIs, school fees, petrol, Swiggy, Zomato, sale on Myntra, birthday gifts, one sudden expense… and at the end of the month, you look at your balance and say, “I’ll start investing from next month. Pakka.”Next month looks surprisingly similar.So let’s start with an honest admission: for most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough.At Value Research, whenever we look at this, we don’t begin with a number like “you must save 30%”. We start with a different idea: savings are not what is left after spending. Savings are what you decide first; spending adjusts after that if you flip this order, the maths – and your behaviour – changes completely.A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income to savings and investments. However, I also know that for many people today, 30% sounds like a bad joke. So instead of fighting over the “ideal” number, let’s work with two simpler questions:To answer the first question, you need to know where your money is actually going, not where you think it is going.For one or two months, track your expenses honestly – not for Instagram, for yourself. You don’t need an app; even a simple notebook or spreadsheet works.Once you see your own pie chart, three things usually stand out:Your first “investment” might simply be plugging two or three leaks. Even if that frees up only ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month, that is your starting SIP.Now let’s look at how “small” that really is.When we run these numbers at Value Research in our retirement and goal calculators, the results are always the same: the gap between zero and small is far bigger than the gap between small and perfect.But what if your income truly is at the survival stage? There are people for whom even ₹2,000 is a luxury some months. If that’s your reality, you have two parallel jobs. One is to create a tiny habit – even ₹500 or ₹1,000 a month into a recurring deposit or a conservative fund. The absolute amount is less important than the mental switch from “I’ll save if anything is left” to “I will save something, and then I will live on the rest. ”The second job is to make sure that as your income grows, your lifestyle doesn’t expand at the same speed. This is where a lot of middle-class Indians quietly sabotage themselves. Every salary increase automatically becomes a better phone, nicer meals out, upgraded gadgets, and bigger car loans. The percentage saved stays the same, or sometimes even falls.A very powerful habit – one we often build into plans at Value Research – is the “step-up”. Each year, when your salary goes up, you increase your SIPs and savings before you upgrade anything else.In many examples we’ve run, the step-up strategy leads to a dramatically higher corpus at the end, without you ever feeling an acute “sacrifice” in any single year. You just avoid letting every pay hike leak out into lifestyle.Now, how do you decide your own number?Here’s a simple approach:If that number feels tight, start a little lower and promise yourself one thing: every time your income goes up, your savings rate will go up faster than your spending.At Value Research, when we build long-term plans, we don’t assume people will suddenly start saving 40% from next month. We assume they will start somewhere realistic, and then we design step-ups. The rigour is in the process, not in some magical starting number.One last point. Many people postpone investing because they are embarrassed by how small their starting amount looks. Please don’t underestimate the psychological power of seeing a small, growing pile that you started and maintained. It changes how you think about yourself: from “I can’t save” to “I am someone who always saves something.” That identity is worth more than one extra dinner out.So how much should you save and invest when your income feels just about enough? The honest answer is: start with whatever you can without lying to yourself, protect that amount like you protect your rent, and then make sure it rises every time your income increases. The “right” number is not what a formula says; it’s the number you will actually stick to for the next 20 years.The perfect percentage can wait. The first rupee cannot.","Dhirendra Kumar: For most people, the problem is not which fund to choose. It’s how much they can realistically save when it feels like the money is just about enough. A good rule of thumb for many middle-class households is to allocate 20–30% of their take-home income.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126072870,imgsize-47970,width-400,resizemode-4/saving-and-investing.jpg"

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.
