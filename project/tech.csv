When Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost crashed into each other at Suzuka

When Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost worked together

Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost ’s rivalry is counted among the most intense even today. Such was the inter-team competition between the two McLaren drivers that, despite coming from the same team, the McLaren duo clashed with each other at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix , killing all chances of at least one of them taking the number 1 slot on the podium.One has not seen a rivalry as serious as that of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. The tension between them to win at any cost reached an all-time high when they crashed at the Suzuka Circuit in 1989. Prost retired after the crash, and Senna won, only to be disqualified later along with a hefty fine of $100,000 and a six-month ban. Things turned even worse when Senna blamed Prost for the incident.As Formula 1 shared a post to revisit the moment ahead of the upcoming Japanese Grand Prix on April 6, F1 fans were quick to react to the epic moment. Giving a reminder to the current F1 teams, an X user wrote, “F1 teams need to keep this in mind: unhealthy rivalry on the track can cost you everything.” Another reacted, “An iconic moment that changed the season. Suzuka 1989 – unforgettable.” An X user called it “the greatest rivalry in all sports combined.” A comment also read: “Senna vs Prost, the ultimate F1 grudge match.” Some also wrote while remembering Senna, “Miss this legend!”As if this was not enough, their rivalry continued when Prost moved to Ferrari, and the two once again got involved in a similar crash at Suzuka a year later. Senna rammed his car into Prost ahead of him at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix.Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were almost unbeatable when they raced for McLaren together and went on to win 15 out of 16 Grand Prix as a team.Senna and Prost had reconciled years after Prost’s retirement in 1993. Prost had once told Canal+ channel, “In the six months before his death, we spoke regularly on the phone, sometimes two or three times a week. He was not the same anymore, he even begged me to come back.”Also read: Here’s how fans at Suzuka make the Japanese Grand Prix the most special race of the year Senna died during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at the Imola Circuit in Italy when his car crashed into a barrier. Several films and shows have been made about his life, and all of them revisit his rivalry with Prost.",Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost's rivalry reached an all-time high when they crashed at the Suzuka Circuit in 1989.

The Ghibli craze is viral and almost at an unprecedented level. Little surprising then that ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on the seventh heaven ever since the past few days.An X user named Sohail Ahmed wrote: ""After a long time I see positivity on x because of people sharing cute images of their family and loved ones. Thanks Sam"". While writing the same, he quoted Sam Altman's tweet where he wrote, ""can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep.""Responding to Sohail Ahmed, OpenAI CEO wrote, ""this is generally a quite negative platform, so i am happy we were able to bring some joy temporarily.""This is not the first time that Sam Altman and Elon Musk have made fun of each other. Elon Musk has made fun of ChatGPT's Ghibli image generator in some posts on Twitter. One went on to hint how the company is wasting resources it took for noble causes for inane things.The two have a history of taking jabs at each other publicly. Earlier this year, Elon Musk along with a coalition of deep-pocketed investors made a bid to acquire ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The offer, he said, is aimed to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit business. Altman spurned the buyout offer, saying that OpenAI is ""not for sale,"" and called the overture by Musk, who owns rival startup xAI, an attempt to ""slow us down.""In response to Altman's filing, Tesla's CEO told the court he would drop his bid for OpenAI if the startup halts its restructuring. Altman rejected the proposal before OpenAI's board had even seen it, Musk said. That is a breach of fiduciary duty, he argued.The Ghibli craze has gone viral after ChatGPT's update to GPT-4o, released last week. The GPT-4o features many advancements, including more accurate text rendering and the ability to follow more detailed, complex prompts. Of these, one style quickly flooded Twitter and Instagram, as users of ChatGPT (and OpenAI’s text-to-video service, Sora) began emulating the work of the Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli behind movies like “Spirited Away” and “Howl’s Moving Castle.”",ChatGPT maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on the seventh heaven ever since the past few days.

School reunion

Cold-blooded killings

Fake alibi

HYDERABAD: When 30-year-old Rajitha, a teacher from Ameenpur mandal in Sangareddy district, rushed to the hospital on March 27 claiming she and her three children had fallen sick after eating curd rice, her husband and neighbours were in a shock.The three kids - 12-year-old Sai Krishna, 10-year-old Madhu Priya, and eight-year-old Gautam - were already dead, and she appeared to be in distress. But something didn't add up.What initially seemed like a case of food-poisoning quickly unravelled into something far more sinister - a cold-blooded murder plot driven by Rajitha's affair with her former classmate, Sooru Shiva Kumar. Overwhelmed by her desire to marry Shiva, she suffocated her own children one by one, then faked an illness to cover up her crime, all for a new life with her lover, police said.A week later, police cracked the case. Sangareddy DSP Paritosh Pankaj revealed the details on Wednesday.Rajitha had been unhappy in her marriage to A Chennaiah, a 50-year-old water tanker driver who was 20 years her senior. Chennaiah's first wife had passed away during childbirth, and in 2013, he married Rajitha, with whom he had three children. However, she reportedly always resented their life together.Her chance at escape came when she reconnected with Shiva, 30, while planning a school reunion. What started as friendly conversations quickly turned into an affair, with the two meeting frequently and developing a physical relationship.But when Rajitha expressed her desire to marry him, Shiva, a private firm employee, hesitated. He told her he would consider marriage only if she didn't have a husband and children.On March 27, when Chennaiah left for work at 10pm, Rajitha saw an opportunity. Earlier that evening, at 6 pm, she called Shiva and confirmed her plan. Shiva urged her not to delay. ""One by one, she suffocated her children to death. First, she tied a towel tightly over Sai Krishna's nose and mouth, holding it until he stopped breathing. Next, she repeated the same method on Madhu Priya, pressing down with calculated force. She ended Gautam's life in the same brutal way,"" the SP said.After ensuring all three children were dead, Rajitha calmly staged the scene - arranging their bodies to make it appear as if they had lost consciousness after dinner.When Chennaiah returned home, Rajitha pretended to be in pain, clutching her stomach and claiming she felt sick. She told him the children had also fallen ill after eating curd rice. In a panic, Chennaiah rushed to get help from neighbours to take her to the hospital. That's when he stumbled upon his three children, who were already dead. Overwhelmed with grief, his only concern was saving his wife and rushed her to hospital.When the autopsy report revealed that the children had no signs of food-poisoning, suspicion fell on Rajitha. Under intense interrogation, Rajitha finally broke down. She admitted that Shiva was aware of her plan.Both Rajitha and Shiva were arrested. Shiva hails from Nalgonda district, while Rajitha belongs to Thalakondapalli in Rangareddy.","Teacher Rajitha, 30, suffocated her three children one by one.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Tom Brady's ex Gisele Bündchen flaunts stunning post-baby figure in new photos—fans can’t believe how fit she looks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-ex-gisele-bndchen-flaunts-stunning-post-baby-figure-in-new-photosfans-cant-believe-how-fit-she-looks/articleshow/119924960.cms,"Credit: X/@giseledaily

Gisele Bündchen’s post-baby glow is unreal—see her jaw-dropping look in new fitness snaps



Supermodel Gisele Bündchen radiated elegance and serenity as she soaked up Miami’s spring sunshine in a relaxed outing with her partner, Joaquim Valente. Just a month after welcoming their first child together, the 44-year-old Brazilian beauty seemed at ease, seamlessly blending her role as a new mother with her love for the outdoors.Gisele Bündchen, known for her impeccable style and enviable physique, took to the waters for a peaceful water bike ride. Dressed in a sophisticated black halter-style sports bra paired with coordinating shorts, she embodied effortless grace. Her natural, sun-kissed tresses cascaded over her shoulders, and her choice of oversized black sunglasses and a wide-brimmed straw hat added both practicality and charm to her look. She pedaled barefoot, embracing the feel of the ocean beneath her.Beside her was Joaquim Valente, the jiu-jitsu instructor who transitioned from a longtime friend to a romantic partner in 2023. Dressed casually in a black tee, printed shorts, and a backwards cap, he exuded an air of relaxation, enjoying the quality time with Gisele.The couple has been spotted on multiple outings recently, including a scenic boat day in Biscayne Bay, where Gisele showcased her effortless style in a sleek black one-piece swimsuit, complemented by a flowing wrap skirt. A nearby baby bassinet hinted at her new journey intomotherhood , as she engaged in lively conversation with a friend while Joaquim took a refreshing dip.In February Gisele had given birth to a baby boy—her third child and first with Joaquim. The baby’s middle name, River, carries a poetic connection to nature, aligning beautifully with the names of Gisele’s older children, Benjamin Rein, 15, and Vivian Lake, 11, whom she shares with ex-husband Tom Brady .The birth took place in early 2025, though the exact date remains private. Yet, despite the recent addition to her family, Gisele has already resumed light yoga and daily walks, often accompanied by her newborn. Her ability to balance wellness and motherhood showcases her deep commitment to both.While Gisele embraces this new phase, Tom Brady remains deeply engaged in his business ventures and sports commitments. As a co-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he has an influential role in shaping the team’s future, particularly with the upcoming NFL Draft where the team holds the No. 6 pick. Additionally, he continues his career as a football analyst for Fox Sports, further cementing his post-NFL legacy.Despite their different paths, Brady acknowledged Gisele’s new chapter in a subtle yet thoughtful manner. Upon learning about the birth of her child, he shared an introspective quote on his Instagram story: ""I really think the secret to being loved is to love. And the secret to being interesting is to be interested. And the secret to have others find beauty in you is to find beauty in others. And the secret to having a friend is being a friend.""Meanwhile, Gisele has made a striking return to modeling. Just weeks after giving birth, she dazzled in a campaign for a luxury German-Swedish fashion brand. A veteran of the fashion world, she has worked with esteemed brands such as Victoria's Secret, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Michael Kors. Her comeback is a testament to her enduring influence in the industry, proving that motherhood and professional success can harmoniously coexist.Also Read: Val Kilmer’s intense performances defined an era— NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt pays heartfelt tribute to late ‘Top Gun’ star As Gisele and Joaquim enjoy their new journey together, fans eagerly await glimpses of their growing family while watching the supermodel redefine beauty, grace, and strength in her own signature way.","Gisele Bündchen and partner Joaquim Valente enjoyed a water bike ride in Miami.
