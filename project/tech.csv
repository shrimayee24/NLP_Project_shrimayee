Can we control comps with just thoughts? Shubhanshu Shukla & crew may find out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-we-control-comps-with-just-thoughts-shubhanshu-shukla-crew-may-find-out/articleshow/122215910.cms,"Will aid people On Earth



Can human thought ‚Äî unaided by muscle or speech ‚Äî be used to control machines? That‚Äôs the bold question the Ax-4 crew, including Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, are probing at the International Space Station (ISS).Wearing a specialised headset that tracks blood flow in the brain, the astronauts participated in ‚ÄúPhotonGrav‚Äù, a European Space Agency (ESA) and Polish Space Agency (POLSA) experiment exploring whether brain signals alone could one day operate computers and spacecraft systems.The headset uses near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor attention levels and detect logical errors, capturing neural activity without any physical movement. If successful, this research could revolutionise how astronauts interact with onboard systems ‚Äî especially in high-stress or hands-free conditions ‚Äî by turning thought into action.While the crew kicked off the study on day four of their stay at the ISS, the project led by Slawosz Uznanski is expected to continue through their stint there. As space missions grow longer and more complex, projects like PhotonGrav could lay the groundwork for more seamless, intuitive interfaces ‚Äî maybe even bringing science fiction a step closer to everyday use.While the experiment is being trialled in orbit, its real-world impact could be profound, as per ESA and Axiom Space. On Earth, the same brain-computer interface technology could power new assistive tools for people with mobility or communication challenges, and offer breakthroughs in neurorehabilitation.Shux, who had begun his research at ISS with myogenesis study, which could uncover how microgravity contributes to muscle loss before moving on to his microalgae study, continued the operations for myogenesis in the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) of the ISS.The study, by identifying the molecular pathways behind skeletal muscle dysfunction, could lead to targeted therapies to prevent atrophy during long-duration spaceflight. These insights may also translate to improved treatments for muscle-wasting conditions on Earth, including those linked to aging and immobility.‚ÄúFinally, the crew documented activities for the Astronaut Mental Health study, contributing to research on cognitive well-being in space. This project can benefit others on Earth by developing remote technologies for diagnosing and treating mental disorders, particularly for individuals in isolated or challenging environments where access to mental health care is limited,‚Äù Axiom Space said.An ultrasound scan was conducted as part of the ‚ÄúTelemetric Health AI‚Äù study, which merges biometric data with mission analytics to better understand how spaceflight affects cardiovascular and balance systems. ‚ÄúUsing advanced data science, the project aims to enable smarter, real-time health monitoring for astronauts with potential applications for remote health care on Earth,‚Äù Axiom said.","The Ax-4 crew, including Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, are probing at the International Space Station (ISS) Wearing a specialised headset that tracks blood flow in the brain, the astronauts participated in ‚ÄòPhotonGrav‚Äô, a European Space Agency and Polish Space Agency experiment.

iPhone 16e vs Pixel 9a: Everything you need to know about Apple and Google's new budget flagships

As the launch of Apple iPhone 17 series gets closer, rumorus about the upcoming iPhone series have increased. The 2025 iPhone lineup may consist of four models ‚Äì iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and the all-new iPhone 17 Air. Tipster Majin Bu recently shared alleged renders of the iPhone 17 Pro that shows a significant design change with the coming-soon device. The leakster, in a blog post, claims that the Cupertino-based company may reposition the Apple logo which is currently placed slightly off-center and below the camera module since the iPhone X. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, the logo may now be moved lower, toward the center bottom of the phone. ‚ÄúThis recent discovery, reported by direct sources among case manufacturers, marks an evolution in Apple‚Äôs aesthetic language,‚Äù Bu writes.The report adds that the repositioning of Apple logo has raised concerns among manufacturers about possible interference, leading the industry to look for ways to ensure continued compatibility. Some factories have already produced cases based on the current design and are waiting for official confirmation before making changes. To address the issue, case makers are working on design changes.A report by The Information previously said that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with a redesigned rear panel composed of both aluminum and glass. It may feature an aluminum rear panel, housing a camera bump, bigger than the one found on the iPhone 16 Pro models.The report further added that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with an aluminium frame, replacing the titanium frame like their predecessors.On the specifications part, the phone may come powered by Apple‚Äôs A19 Pro chip, manufactured using TSMC‚Äôs 3nm process. iPhone 17 Pro is said to offer 12GB of RAM, up from the iPhone 16 Pro‚Äôs 8GB.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America‚Äôs edge isn‚Äôt just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta‚Äôs new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That‚Äôs right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America‚Äôs best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they‚Äôve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don‚Äôt need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley.

IBAN rules for local and international transfers in Oman have changed: What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iban-rules-for-local-and-international-transfers-in-oman-have-changed-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/122210122.cms,"From July 1, 2025, Oman mandates IBAN for all domestic transfers, while international payments no longer require it/ (Representative Image)

IBAN Requirement Extended to Domestic Transfers



Regional Banks Begin Issuing Guidance



What Is IBAN and Why It Matters



It includes country-specific codes (e.g., ""AE"" for the UAE or ""OM"" for Oman), check digits, and the traditional account number.



It serves as a universal identifier, much like a postal code for bank accounts.



It does not replace the local account number but works as an added layer for enhanced accuracy.





The Sultanate of Oman has announced that beginning July 1, 2025, the use of the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) will be mandatory for all domestic financial transactions. This change comes as part of the Central Bank of Oman‚Äôs efforts to enhance the efficiency, speed, and accuracy of financial operations within the country.The mandate had already been implemented for international transfers earlier this year, and now it extends to transactions within Oman itself.The Central Bank of Oman had previously made IBAN compulsory for international transfers starting March 31, 2024, and the results have been positive.According to a statement from the Central Bank of Oman, this move has already ‚Äúsignificantly improved transaction accuracy, reduced errors, and accelerated processing times for both local and international bank transfers.‚ÄùNow, beginning July 1, 2025, all domestic financial transfers within Oman must include the IBAN. This means individuals and businesses making local payments between Omani banks will be required to use this standardized format.In a key clarification, the Central Bank also confirmed that international transactions will still be accepted without an IBAN ‚Äî a change from the previous requirement. This implies more flexibility for foreign entities transferring money into Oman.The regulatory change has also prompted responses from financial institutions in neighboring countries. The Emirates NBD app, a major banking platform in the UAE, has started displaying an awareness message for users sending money to Oman.The advisory on the app states:""In line with new regulatory mandates, IBAN is now a mandatory requirement for all payments to Sultanate of Oman, starting from July 1, 2025.""To ensure compliance, Emirates NBD is urging customers to update beneficiary details. It added:""Please delete and re-add your beneficiaries in Oman using their IBAN to avoid payment failures. Kindly note a cooling period of 4 hours will apply for newly added beneficiaries.""This practical advisory is a proactive step to avoid disruptions and failed transactions once the regulation comes into force.The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is a globally standardized format for identifying bank accounts across countries. It‚Äôs designed to streamline cross-border payments and reduce the chance of errors.Here‚Äôs what makes IBAN important:Before the implementation of the IBAN system, banking transactions especially international ones, were prone to delays and costly errors due to inconsistent formats and identifiers. Since its adoption in most of Europe, the Middle East, and parts of the Caribbean, IBAN has proven to be a reliable standard.The Central Bank of Oman‚Äôs extension of the IBAN requirement to domestic transactions is expected to align the country further with global best practices, ensuring smoother and safer money transfers.","From July 1, 2025, Oman mandates IBAN for all domestic transfers, while international payments no longer require it.

Who is Habubu and Why is the UAE Talking About Her?

A New Era for Bigg Boss: AI Enters the Game

Why This Matters for the UAE





Bigg Boss 19 is gearing up for a sensational return this August 2025, and it looks like the show is about to make television history with a bold and futuristic twist. A latest report by India Forums suggests that UAE‚Äôs first interactive AI robot doll, Habubu, will be entering the Bigg Boss house as one of the 17 contestants, marking the first time a non-human has joined the reality franchise. This surprising move has sparked global curiosity, especially across the UAE where Habubu has already become a viral phenomenon.Habubu is not your average robot. Designed as an interactive AI doll, she‚Äôs built with state-of-the-art conversational intelligence, emotional recognition, and basic domestic functionality. According to IFCM, the UAE-based company behind her, Habubu can speak up to seven languages, including Hindi, which gives her an edge in a show like Bigg Boss that thrives on communication and drama.What truly sets Habubu apart is her appearance and charm. With large expressive eyes, a warm and engaging personality, and dressed in traditional Arabic attire, she has captured attention across social media platforms. Her growing fan base in the Gulf sees her as more than just a tech novelty, she's being celebrated as a cultural bridge between the Arab world and mainstream South Asian entertainment.Notably, IFCM, which also managed former Bigg Boss contestant Abdu Rozik, is handling Habubu‚Äôs participation.This strategic backing adds credibility to the reports and indicates the move is well-planned, not a publicity stunt.Bigg Boss, hosted once again by Salman Khan , is known for reinventing itself each season. But Season 19‚Äôs theme, reportedly titled ""Rewind"", suggests a nostalgic return to classic rules, legendary tasks, and dramatic moments from past editions. Within this context, the inclusion of an AI contestant like Habubu stands out as both retro and futuristic, a combination sure to intrigue audiences.As reported by Siasat, Habubu is expected to be specially reprogrammed for the show to ensure a balanced dynamic among the 17 expected contestants, 16 human and one AI. This means she will not overshadow her co-contestants but instead enhance the show's entertainment quotient in unique ways. Her multilingual abilities and AI-driven emotional responses could make her a central figure in house dynamics.For UAE residents and tech enthusiasts, Habubu‚Äôs participation is more than just reality TV news, it‚Äôs a significant cultural moment. It showcases homegrown innovation on one of the biggest entertainment platforms in South Asia, watched by millions across India, the Middle East, and beyond.Her entry into Bigg Boss also aligns with the UAE‚Äôs vision to be a global leader in AI and smart technologies. With Dubai and Abu Dhabi already hosting several robotics and AI expos annually, Habubu‚Äôs rise reflects how far the nation has come in integrating tech with everyday life and now, with global pop culture.As interest surges, fans in the UAE are keenly watching how this historic experiment unfolds. Will Habubu win hearts or even the trophy? One thing‚Äôs certain: this season of Bigg Boss is set to spark conversations far beyond the walls of the house.","Habubu is an interactive AI doll with state-of-the-art conversational intelligence, emotional recognition, and basic domestic functionality.

Entertainment Continues for Visitors





The Dubai Fountain, one of the world‚Äôs most iconic and visited attractions, has been out of action since April 2025. Visitors to the Dubai Mall Waterfront Promenade may have noticed its absence, but it‚Äôs for a good reason. The fountain is currently undergoing a five-month-long renovation, aimed at upgrading everything from its flooring to its choreography systems.This temporary pause in operations was confirmed by Emaar, the developer behind the landmark, who shared a detailed behind-the-scenes video on Instagram. The sneak peek reveals the enormous effort underway to preserve and improve the performance and aesthetic of what remains the world‚Äôs largest choreographed fountain system.According to the video posted by Emaar, one of the main upgrades is the installation of a brand-new flooring system. The previous surface was prone to occasional cracking, which made routine maintenance both necessary and disruptive. The new flooring addresses these challenges with a more durable and visually striking design.Key upgrades include:These aren‚Äôt just aesthetic upgrades, they are designed to ensure longer-lasting performance and improved ease of maintenance.To understand the scale of the task, it helps to consider the size of the fountain lake itself, it spans an area equal to 18 football fields. Beneath the still surface lies a sophisticated network of:These elements are meticulously programmed to move in perfect harmony with music. Emaar‚Äôs engineering team shared that programming a single song for the fountain show can take several weeks, involving multiple types of robotic systems:Currently, hundreds of workers are involved in the renovation effort, working both in and around the 1.3-metre-deep lake. Though relatively shallow, the water is deep enough to house the powerful jets and robots that give the fountain its signature performance.For cleaning, underwater robots have been deployed. These machines keep the lakebed clean and make use of the newly installed soft flooring, which allows for quicker and more efficient cleaning. Water quality checks are also being conducted regularly, with samples taken from various points across the lake to ensure high standards are maintained.Although the fountain shows are paused, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a unique experience. The site has been fenced off, but in a smart and creative way.The construction fencing is embedded with digital display screens, which continuously play archival footage of the Dubai Fountain in action, timed beautifully to the Burj Khalifa light show. So while the live performance is temporarily suspended, the spirit and spectacle of the Dubai Fountain remain on full display for anyone visiting the promenade.","The Dubai Fountain is undergoing a five-month-long renovation.

UAE: How UAE-based mother-son startup is using VR for emotional healing in cancer recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-how-uae-based-mother-son-startup-is-using-vr-for-emotional-healing-in-cancer-recovery/articleshow/122186109.cms,"UAE-based startup X-Technology, develops a virtual reality therapy for cancer survivors.

Healing Beyond the Diagnosis

A Long Journey of Innovation in Psychotechnology

Scientific Support and Research on VR Therapy

Real-Life Impact from Users

A Personal Mission to Restore Humanity in Healing





For many cancer patients, the hardest battle begins once treatment ends. While physical pain may lessen, the psychological impact, the fear, anxiety, and loss of direction often lingers much longer. A UAE-based startup, X-Technology, is pioneering a novel form of emotional support using virtual reality (VR) technology to help patients confront these challenges.In an exclusive interview with local news outlet, KT, Nargiz Noimann-Zander, founder of X-Technology, explained, ‚ÄúWe don't work with cancer, we work with the psyche. We don‚Äôt treat the diagnosis. We help with what the diagnosis does to a person‚Äôs emotional state.‚Äù Through immersive VR exercises, users are invited to externalize and face their fears in a controlled, virtual environment.David, CTO of X-Technology and Nargiz‚Äôs son, further described one of the key VR exercises: ‚ÄúYou need to try to hold the fear inside each sphere and make them come closer. When they come close, you see a flow. That means you‚Äôre on the right track. It‚Äôs all mind-driven.‚Äù In this exercise, the user places the same fear into two spheres floating in a galactic space and focuses on merging them until they explode in virtual stardust, symbolizing emotional release.Nargiz has spent over 25 years blending psychology, neuroscience, and technology. Speaking to KT, she shared how her work began out of personal necessity: ‚ÄúOne of my sons had serious heart issues when he was a child, and that‚Äôs when I started looking into using computer games as a gentle way to support healing.‚ÄùHer early efforts led to the founding of the Health Centre in 1997, a collaborative space where doctors, psychologists, and neuroscientists sought gentle, science-backed healing methods. Between 1999 and 2003, her team focused on biofeedback to understand psychophysiological states, before developing game-based emotional support tools between 2003 and 2009. ‚ÄúOn modest Pentium systems, we built the very first prototypes of game-based interventions,‚Äù Nargiz told KT.From 2009 to 2017, these tools evolved by integrating biofeedback and real patient input, culminating in the adoption of VR technology in 2017. By 2019, AI, virtual assistants, and digital twins were added to the platform. Today, X-Technology‚Äôs system is used worldwide in clinics, educational institutions, and corporate wellness programs. David emphasized to KT their strict data privacy approach: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very worried about the data. We don‚Äôt connect to Wi-Fi or the cloud. Everything is stored offline inside the headset. I don't want anybody to know what's happening in my brain.‚ÄùProfessor Sam Abuomar, Director of the Artificial Intelligence Master‚Äôs Programme at Lewis University and visiting professor at the American University of Sharjah, is leading a study evaluating the impact of X-Technology‚Äôs VR platform on patients recovering from cancer and those with chronic illnesses. He told KT, ‚ÄúThe VR experience has a positive impact because it emulates certain emotional states or past experiences. Especially for high-risk patients, those with conditions like cancer or undergoing chemotherapy, this type of immersive support can improve their emotional and psychological well-being.‚ÄùProfessor Abuomar‚Äôs research focuses on memory, emotion, and trauma processing. He explained that future system versions might tailor virtual environments to evoke comforting, familiar experiences, such as family settings or workplaces. He added, ‚ÄúIn our literature review, we came across about 15 studies conducted between 2020 and 2025. All of them showed promising results. For example, a 2023 Cleveland Clinic study on 52 cancer patients using interactive therapeutic VR reported significant reduction in depression. Another European study in 2025 on surgical patients found a significant reduction in intraoperative pain.‚ÄùThough still early, Abuomar and his students have begun pilot testing with 10 patients to compare traditional therapy with VR-based support. ‚ÄúIf this proves successful, it could be a big step for this kind of tech-based mental health intervention,‚Äù he said.Maria Efimova, a clinical psychologist based in Moscow, shared her experience using the headset for over two years. In a conversation with KT, she said, ‚ÄúThe benefits have been tremendous. I‚Äôve seen a significant reduction in anxiety, fears of public speaking, and constant worrying. When I face health-related stress or even physical pain, this is the first thing I turn to. It‚Äôs like having a coach on call.‚ÄùMaria uses two main programs: one to dissolve fears and another to address body-related projections. ‚ÄúMy mother uses them too. I often recommend it to my clients. Even after one session, I feel less tension and more calmness,‚Äù she said.Nargiz Noimann-Zander‚Äôs mission extends beyond technology to restoring empathy and humanity in healing. She leads international research centers and has authored nine books. As a mother of eight and grandmother of three, she reflected in her interview with KT, ‚ÄúWhen future technologies meet a deep understanding of human consciousness, we access a whole new level of self-awareness and possibility.‚ÄùHer goal is clear: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about fighting the disease. It‚Äôs about helping people face what it does to their mind and soul and giving them the tools to rise again,‚Äù she concluded.","UAE-based startup, X-Technology, develops a virtual reality therapy for cancer survivors.

Round-the-Clock Cyber Patrols and Parental Role





Sharjah Police have rescued a 13-year-old Emirati boy who developed a drug addiction after receiving unsolicited messages on WhatsApp. The Anti-Narcotics Department at Sharjah Police responded immediately when the child‚Äôs father reached out for help. Brigadier Majid Al Asam, Director of the department, shared the details of the case in an exclusive statement to Gulf News.‚ÄúWe received a call from the child‚Äôs parent asking for support, and we acted immediately,‚Äù Brigadier Al Asam told. The boy had started receiving random WhatsApp messages offering various types of drugs. Without understanding the danger, he transferred money and collected drugs from a location shared by the dealer. These messages are often broadcast to many users across the UAE, targeting vulnerable individuals ‚Äî even children.Sharjah Police acted promptly and intervened to stop the addiction early, arranging medical and psychological care. Within two weeks, the boy showed clear signs of recovery.‚ÄúWe have continued to follow up on his recovery, and thank God, he is now in good health,‚Äù Al Asam said.The case highlights a growing challenge: drug trafficking via the internet, particularly through social networking platforms.In 2024 alone, the Sharjah Police Anti-Narcotics Department recorded 912 cases of drug peddling via WhatsApp, resulting in the arrest of 680 suspects. Authorities also blocked 680 websites and social media accounts that promoted narcotics, counterfeit goods, and banned substances.Brigadier Al Asam described how traffickers use messages or voice notes sent randomly to advertise drugs such as:‚ÄúMany users buy drugs via the internet and send money online to dealers. Some deposit money in bank accounts and are then informed about the drug location via WhatsApp,‚Äù he explained.Sharjah Police have deployed online cyber patrols operating 24/7 to monitor suspicious digital activity. These patrols have already identified 800 different criminal methods used by traffickers and cybercriminals in the UAE.The department urged parents to stay vigilant about their children‚Äôs online activity and behavioural changes.‚ÄúIf you notice any changes in your child‚Äôs behaviour or signs of drug use, don‚Äôt wait. Report it right away. Acting quickly can save your child‚Äôs life,‚Äù Brigadier Al Asam advised. He stressed that early intervention is key and encouraged families not to delay contacting authorities if they suspect any involvement in drug-related activity.","Sharjah Police rescue 13-year-old boy lured into drug use through WhatsApp messages.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API ‚Äì the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.‚ÄúThis change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,‚Äù NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. ‚ÄúThis step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,‚Äù said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store‚Äôs brand name or any custom label.‚ÄúThis will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,‚Äù said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, ‚ÄúIt helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.‚ÄùBy standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia‚Äôs new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes.

Grammarly acquires Superhuman as part of plan to become an ‚ÄòAI productivity platform‚Äô,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/grammarly-acquires-superhuman-as-part-of-plan-to-become-an-ai-productivity-platform/articleshow/122211679.cms,"What Grammarly said about acquiring Superhuman



‚ÄúThis is the future we‚Äôve been building toward since day one: AI that works where people work, not where companies want them to work. With Superhuman, we can deliver that future to millions more professionals while giving our existing users another surface for agent collaboration that simply doesn‚Äôt exist anywhere else. Email isn‚Äôt just another app; it‚Äôs where professionals spend significant portions of their day, and it‚Äôs the perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously.‚Äù

Grammarly has announced its plans to acquire the AI-based email app Superhuman. This acquisition aims to provide Grammarly with its email platform to feature its product. Superhuman helps users respond one to two days faster and save four hours every week on their email communications. Grammarly stated that email is currently its ‚Äúnumber-one use case‚Äù for professional users, with its AI assistant helping to revise over 50 million emails per week across more than 20 email providers. The acquisition of Superhuman, a popular email platform, aligns with Grammarly's strategy to enhance its offerings within this primary use case. Grammarly also has wider goals that, similar to many other tech companies, centre around AI, particularly AI agents .With this acquisition, Grammarly is planning to build a productivity platform with AI agents, aiming to streamline workflows across 500,000+ apps and websites.Commenting on the acquisition announcement, Shishir Mehrotra, CEO of Grammarly, said:Superhuman is used by 94% of its weekly active users for AI features, and Grammarly‚Äôs plans to acquire the platform mark a step toward building an AI-powered workspace. Superhuman users already send and respond to 72% more emails per hour, and the platform aims to enhance this further with AI agents that can manage inboxes, schedule meetings, conduct research, and write emails in a user‚Äôs voice. These agents will use context, reasoning, and system interaction to boost professional productivity .Grammarly‚Äôs research shows growing interest in agentic AI, with professionals ready for AI to autonomously manage tasks like admin support (44%), collaboration (39%), and strategic communication (36%).Two-thirds of users expect AI to triple productivity in five years, while industry leaders foresee a 10x jump. Grammarly‚Äôs acquisitions of Superhuman and Coda support its vision of building a multi-agent productivity platform, where apps function as intelligent collaborators.Email, where professionals spend over three hours daily, is seen as the ideal setting for deploying these AI agents.

Google Home introduces 'Admin' and 'Member' roles for better smart home control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-home-introduces-admin-and-member-roles-for-better-smart-home-control/articleshow/122211424.cms,"How this Google Home update will make it easier for users to add kids under 13



Google Home 's latest update has added new ""Admin"" and ""Member"" roles to improve smart home control by allowing users to assign different levels of access. This feature, which Google began testing last year, aims to clarify who can manage smart home devices and services. Individuals designated as ""Admin"" will have complete control over all devices, services, and users within their smart home setup. Meanwhile, ""Members"" will be limited to basic device controls, such as viewing a security camera's live feed. However, ""Admins"" have the option to grant ""Members"" additional privileges. This includes providing ""Settings"" access for control over device and home-wide settings, or enabling ""Activity"" access so Members can monitor device history and recent events, like a visitor detected by a doorbell camera.Apart from the new roles, Google is also streamlining how children under 13 can be added to the Home app. After setting up a child‚Äôs Google account through Family Link, parents can now invite them to their Google Home, where they‚Äôll automatically be added as a Member.Previously, the process required navigating through Family Link, Google Home, or Google Assistant settings to add a child‚Äôs voice to the smart home system before sending an invitation‚Äîsomething many users found confusing.With the updated approach, inviting a child to the home can now be done directly within the Google Home app, provided they are part of the Google family group.The latest update, labelled version 3.33 of the Google Home app, is expected to be widely available soon as the company started rolling it out on June 30. If the app hasn‚Äôt updated automatically, users are advised to check their settings to see if the update can be manually installed. Unlike many Google updates, this update does not mention a phased rollout, suggesting it should be accessible to all users immediately.","Google Home update adds new ""Admin"" and ""Member"" roles to improve smart home control.

What ICEBlock app description says

Attorney General Pam Bondi warns ICEBlock app's developer

ICEBlock, an iPhone app designed for anonymously reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent sightings, has soared to one of the top spots in Apple‚Äôs U.S. App Store rankings, fueled by controversy sparked by the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ‚Äôs remarks. The app, which allows users to share and receive real-time alerts about ICE sightings within a 5-mile radius while maintaining anonymity, gained traction overnight after Bondi criticized it recently.According to ICEBlock's developer Joshua Aaron , he made the app to counter the Trump administration‚Äôs deportation policies, which Aaron compares to Nazi Germany. The app has found a strong user base in Los Angeles, where approximately 20,000 users have reported frequent ICE raids in recent weeks, according to CNN.Stay informed about reported ICE sightings, within a 5 miles radius of your current location, in real-time while maintaining your privacy. ICEBlock is a community-driven app that allows you to share and discover location-based reports without revealing any personal data.Speaking on Fox News with Sean Hannity, Bondi accused the app of potentially endangering law enforcement officers and slammed CNN for ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù it, stating, ‚ÄúShame on them.‚Äù By Tuesday afternoon, ICEBlock had become one of the most downloaded free iPhone apps in the U.S.The app‚Äôs description emphasizes its community-driven approach: ‚ÄúStay informed about reported ICE sightings, within a 5 miles radius of your current location, in real-time while maintaining your privacy. ICEBlock allows you to share and discover location-based reports without revealing any personal data.‚Äù However, the app has drawn sharp criticism from law enforcement advocates. Border Czar Tom Homan, speaking on ‚ÄúThe Will Cain Show,‚Äù called ICEBlock ‚Äúdisgusting,‚Äù arguing it makes law enforcement‚Äôs job more dangerous. ‚ÄúAny network that covers that is disgusting as well,‚Äù Homan added. As ICEBlock‚Äôs popularity surges, the debate over its impact on public safety and immigration enforcement continues to intensify.","ICEBlock, an iPhone app designed for anonymously reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent sightings, has soared to one of the top spots in Apple‚Äôs App Store rankings. The app, which allows users to share and receive real-time alerts about ICE sightings within a 5-mile radius while maintaining anonymity, gained traction overnight after Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122207717,imgsize-201512,width-400,resizemode-4/Immigration-Louisiana.jpg"
Read Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs full memo to employees on Meta Superintelligence Labs: We are going to ‚Ä¶,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-mark-zuckerbergs-full-memo-to-employees-on-meta-superintelligence-labs-we-are-going-to-/articleshow/122207487.cms,"Read Meta CEO‚Äôs full memo to his employees:



As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight. I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for

Meta

to lead the way. Today I want to share some details about how we‚Äôre organizing our AI efforts to build towards our vision: personal superintelligence for everyone.

We‚Äôre going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of our models.

Alexandr Wang has joined Meta to serve as our Chief AI Officer and lead MSL. Alex and I have worked together for several years, and I consider him to be the most impressive founder of his generation. He has a clear sense of the historic importance of superintelligence, and as co-founder and CEO he built ScaleAI into a fast-growing company involved in the development of almost all leading models across the industry.

Nat Friedman has also joined Meta to partner with Alex to lead MSL, heading our work on AI products and applied research. Nat will work with Connor to define his role going forward. He ran GitHub at Microsoft, and most recently has run one of the leading AI investment firms. Nat has served on our Meta Advisory Group for the last year, so he already has a good sense of our roadmap and what we need to do.

We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I‚Äôm excited to share as well:

Trapit Bansal -- pioneered RL on chain of thought and co-creator of o-series models at OpenAI.



Shuchao Bi -- co-creator of GPT-4o voice mode and o4-mini. Previously led multimodal post-training at OpenAI.



Huiwen Chang -- co-creator of GPT-4o‚Äôs image generation, and previously invented MaskGIT and Muse text-to-image architectures at Google Research



Ji Lin -- helped build o3/o4-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4 .1, GPT-4.5, 4o-imagegen, and Operator reasoning stack.



.1, GPT-4.5, 4o-imagegen, and Operator reasoning stack. Joel Pobar -- inference at Anthropic. Previously at Meta for 11 years on HHVM, Hack, Flow, Redex, performance tooling, and machine learning.



Jack Rae -- pre-training tech lead for Gemini and reasoning for Gemini 2.5. Led Gopher and Chinchilla early LLM efforts at DeepMind .



. Hongyu Ren -- co-creator of GPT-4o, 4o-mini, o1-mini, o3-mini, o3 and o4-mini. Previously leading a group for post-training at OpenAI.



Johan Schalkwyk -- former Google Fellow, early contributor to Sesame, and technical lead for Maya.



Pei Sun -- post-training, coding, and reasoning for Gemini at Google Deepmind. Previously created the last two generations of Waymo‚Äôs perception models.



Jiahui Yu -- co-creator of o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o. Previously led the perception team at OpenAI, and co-led multimodal at Gemini.



Shengjia Zhao -- co-creator of ChatGPT, GPT-4, all mini models, 4.1 and o3. Previously led synthetic data at OpenAI.



I‚Äôm excited about the progress we have planned for Llama 4.1 and 4.2. These models power Meta AI, which is used by more than 1 billion monthly actives across our apps and an increasing number of agents across Meta that help improve our products and technology. We‚Äôre committed to continuing to build out these models.

In parallel, we‚Äôre going to start research on our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so. I‚Äôve spent the past few months meeting top folks across Meta, other AI labs, and promising startups to put together the founding group for this small talent-dense effort. We‚Äôre still forming this group and we‚Äôll ask several people across the AI org to join this lab as well.

Meta is uniquely positioned to deliver superintelligence to the world. We have a strong business that supports building out significantly more compute than smaller labs. We have deeper experience building and growing products that reach billions of people. We are pioneering and leading the AI glasses and wearables category that is growing very quickly. And our company structure allows us to move with vastly greater conviction and boldness. I‚Äôm optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone.

We have even more great people at all levels joining this effort in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. I‚Äôm excited to dive in and get to work.","CEO of Meta, a company that develops artificial intelligence, writes a memo to employees.
