Poll What aspect of Phia do you find most appealing? Support for secondhand & sustainable shopping AI-powered price comparison

Read Bill Gates complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment.","Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (previously known as Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery. The post was later reshared by CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (previously known as Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence.

Garena Free Fire OB50 Update FAQs

Will OB50 raise the minimum device spec?

Can Advance-Server progress carry into live servers?

Are previous Naruto Chapter 1 skins returning?

How do I report bugs post-update?

Is there any free way to get Rin?

Free Fire’s numbered updates usually tweak balance and drop a skin or two. OB50, however, lands at a turning-point moment for the game: ranked traffic is dipping, rival shooters are everywhere, and fans have begged for fresh mechanics. The pressure to innovate has never been greater, with competitive players demanding impactful changes to keep Free Fire relevant and engaging. Garena’s answer rolls out around 31 July 2025 (after a two-week public test that opened on 11 July). Inside are a brand-new character named Rin, a follow-up to last year’s wildly popular Naruto collaboration, overhauled weapon stats, slicker menus, and at least one surprise mode aimed at streamers. Most of these features surfaced on the Advance Server, where dataminers and pro squads have already stress-tested the build. Below is a plain-language rundown of every change that matters, so you can decide whether to hoard diamonds, clear storage, or both.According to reports, early scrims show Rin pairs insanely well with Chrono and Alok: land two head-shots, pop Chrono’s shield, then beam enemies with near-zero bloom.

Democrat congressman Greg Casar introduces bill to ban AI-driven price; slams ‘surveillance pricing’; seeks Republican support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrat-congressman-greg-casar-introduces-bill-to-ban-ai-driven-price-slams-surveillance-pricing-seeks-republican-support/articleshow/122866540.cms,"Representational image





US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls “AI-driven price gouging”. The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product, a growing trend known as surveillance pricing.Casar, a Democrat from Texas, says tech companies are going too far by spying on people’s habits and financial history. “Prices should be based on supply and demand and based on how much it costs to make and sell a thing, not based on spying on you and using your private data,"" he told NBC News.The move follows a recent federal trade commission ( FTC ) report that found companies were using users' browser history, GPS location and shopping behaviour to silently adjust prices. The practice is common in e-commerce, and often powered by artificial intelligence.The FTC study, released in January just before president Biden left office, revealed that big firms like Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, Accenture and McKinsey were among those feeding AI systems with consumer data. FTC chair Lina Khan called the system a “black box” where users don’t even realise they’re being charged more based on hidden profiling.Casar’s bill would also prohibit companies from using AI to determine wages based on personal financial data rather than job performance.Several US states are also cracking down. New York passed a law requiring businesses to inform customers when prices are set using algorithms. California may soon follow. But Casar’s bill is the first push for a national ban.The House is about to go into recess, so the bill won’t move before September. But Casar hopes both parties can get behind it. “You don’t have to be a progressive Democrat to say these gigantic corporations in the tech world should not be spying on us and then using what they learn to put it into AI and make our life more expensive,” he said.","US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls ‘AI- driven price gouging’ The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122866910,imgsize-64540,width-400,resizemode-4/122866910.jpg"

An NYPD officer has been suspended without pay after reportedly falling asleep while guarding a suspect who escaped from a New York hospital earlier this week.The man, 36-year-old Stephen Blasetti, had been under watch at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. He was earlier arrested and charged with grand larceny after allegedly stealing two boats while completely naked from a marina on Manhattan’s Dyckman Street.According to police, Blasetti managed to leave the hospital around 6.30 am on Wednesday after changing into a white lab coat and blue hospital trousers, but no shoes. He has not been found since.The NYPD confirmed that the officer assigned to monitor him has been suspended as the department reviews the incident, reported New York Post.Blasetti made headlines after allegedly stripping and jumping into a small sailboat on Saturday afternoon. When officers from the NYPD Harbor Patrol tried to stop him, he reportedly swam to a larger catamaran in the river. He was arrested there and taken to hospital for a mental health check.Police believe he may have been under the influence of methamphetamines during the incident. He is still on the run.","Stephen Blasetti, 36, had been under watch at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Poll Do you believe social media plays a significant role in promoting educational achievements? Yes, definitely! Not really, it’s mostly for entertainment.





A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years.

As the UAE faces scorching summer temperatures reaching nearly 45ºC, outdoor workers are at higher risk of heat-related illnesses. To help, UAE police have launched several initiatives to support laborers during this extreme heat season. From distributing free ice creams, cold drinks, and laban to handing out umbrellas, the police are taking practical steps to keep workers cool and safe.These efforts align with government measures like the midday work ban, designed to protect outdoor laborers from the hottest hours. This summer, the UAE is focused on worker safety and wellbeing in the face of intense heat.In Ajman, police officers have been distributing cold water, laban (a yogurt drink), juice, and small cups of ice cream to laborers and passersby. This simple act provides immediate comfort and relief from the heat. The initiative is part of an ongoing effort, building on last year’s campaign called ‘We Come to You, Our Summer is Cool,’ where officers visited various labor sites to support workers.In Dubai, a similar program called the ‘shade and reward’ initiative provided 300 laborers with free umbrellas. This effort took place at Al Eyas Police Point and aimed to protect workers from direct sunlight during work hours.Besides the umbrellas, authorities shared practical advice about staying hydrated, preventing heatstroke, and highlighted workers’ legal rights and available services.The UAE police have been supporting outdoor workers during summer for several years. In 2023, the ‘We Come to You, Our Summer is Cool’ campaign saw officers visiting multiple labor sites to hand out cold water, juices, and other refreshments. This helped thousands of workers stay hydrated and comfortable despite the harsh weather.In Dubai, the General Department of Human Rights at Dubai Police launched the Soqia initiative, which provided cold water and juice to over 600 workers. These ongoing efforts focus on promoting kindness and community spirit while protecting workers from heat-related illnesses.Preventing heat stress is crucial in the UAE’s extreme climate, so managing hydration, rest, and body temperature is essential to protect outdoor workers.The UAE enforces a midday work ban from June 15 to September 15. Outdoor labor is prohibited between 12:30pm and 3pm, the hottest part of the day. This policy, now in its 21st year, aims to reduce heat stress risks for workers exposed to direct sunlight. It’s a crucial step in protecting health and preventing heat-related illnesses.Police distribution of cold refreshments and umbrellas may seem small, but these gestures have real benefits. Staying hydrated and protected from the sun reduces the risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Simple acts like handing out ice cream or cold drinks provide immediate relief and show care for the wellbeing of outdoor workers. The police’s message goes beyond just handing out items, they encourage workers to stay safe, rest when needed, and protect themselves from the harsh midday sun.People can also join in by volunteering to hand out cold drinks and ice cream through the Al Freej Fridge project. It’s a community-driven effort to keep laborers cool during the harsh summer months.","UAE police distribute cold drinks, ice cream, and umbrellas to workers during extreme heat.

Built in 2018 and revealed by Sheikh Hamdan on Instagram, this romantic lake surprised visitors with its design and surrounding trees spelling “LOVE” visible from above. Located about an hour from central Dubai,Love Lake offers walking paths, picnic spots, and beautiful views. It’s popular with couples, families, and photographers alike. In 2021, UAE’s KhalifaSat even captured Love Lake from space, highlighting its striking shape and making it a must-visit landmark in Dubai’s desert.Love Lake is a human-made twin-heart-shaped lake tucked away in Dubai’s Al Qudra desert. From above, it looks like two huge hearts lying side by side, surrounded by desert sands. But it’s not just about the shape.The name “Love Lake” comes from the word “LOVE” spelled out using more than 16,000 trees and plants planted carefully around the water. This isn’t visible from the ground, you have to see it from a drone or aerial image to understand the scale.So why was it made? Simply put: to symbolize connection. Romantic love, yes, but also love for nature, peace, and open space. In a city full of fast-paced innovation, this is one of the calmest, most thoughtful places you can go.Love Lake wasn’t announced in advance. There were no press tours or grand openings.Instead, in November 2018, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, quietly posted an aerial photo of the lake on Instagram.It took people by surprise. Almost overnight, a large, heart-shaped lake had appeared in the middle of the desert, complete with walking trails, rest zones, and desert landscaping. People rushed to find it, visit it, and photograph it. And it hasn’t slowed down since.Dubai’s leaders didn’t just create Love Lake, they’ve also been personally connected to it.In 2018, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (Vice President and Ruler of Dubai) and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed (now UAE President) brought the King of Bahrain to visit Love Lake. It was a quiet but symbolic gesture, a way to show what Dubai stands for beyond skyscrapers and malls.Then in 2019, Love Lake became the setting for a surprise wedding. Sheikh Mohammed showed up unexpectedly at a group ceremony for nine Chinese couples who chose to get married by the lake.

The UAE-made satellite KhalifaSat captured a detailed image of Love Lake from orbit.The photo showed the two heart-shaped lakes and the tree-lettering clearly, even from space. It wasn’t just about the image; it was a moment of pride. A quiet desert spot, built to symbolize love, had become part of the UAE’s space imagery archive.The image was later shared by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, showing how even small, symbolic landmarks can stand out on a global (or galactic) scale.So, if you’re in Dubai and want to see something different, this is it.A1.

Poll Do you believe that stricter laws can deter shoplifting? Yes No





An Indian man was arrested on Thursday at Singapore’s Changi Airport for allegedly stealing items worth over S$5,136 (around Rs 3.5 lakh) from multiple stores, reports the English Daily Straits Times.According to the Singapore Police, the suspect is believed to be involved in a series of thefts from 14 different shops, taking perfumes, cosmetics and bags. The arrest follows a report made on May 29 after a bag was discovered missing during a stocktake at a retail outlet in Jewel Changi.“Preliminary investigations revealed that a supervisor at the store had realised a bag was missing after a stocktaking,” the police were quoted as saying to Straits Times.CCTV footage reportedly showed the man taking the item and leaving without paying.Authorities managed to identify the man after the initial thefts, but he had already left Singapore by the time they confirmed his identity. However, on June 1, when the man returned and was found transiting through Changi Airport, he was arrested.The police confirmed that the stolen items were recovered from him. He is expected to be charged on Friday with theft and fraudulent possession of property.The police have reiterated their zero-tolerance stance on such crimes. “Offenders should not think that they can evade capture by quickly boarding a flight. The police will continue to work closely with stakeholders to prevent and deter shop theft cases,” they said.","An Indian man was arrested on Thursday at Singapore’s Changi Airport for allegedly stealing items worth over S$5,136 (around Rs 3.5 lakh) from multiple stores.

Facts plucked out of thin air

AI use must be 'ethical, responsible and consistent'



Abuse of AI-generated content 'creates mistrust among judges'

'Clear guidelines,' reviewed code of conduct needed for AI use





A search with ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI)chatbot, was intended to facilitate the work of a team of lawyers and find supplementary case examples for their arguments in a dispute before the High Court in Pietermaritzburg, in the coastal province of KwaZulu-Natal.The AI tool did just that, and the legal representatives submitted a notice of appeal in which they cited several authorities and case studies highlighted by the tool.But when the judge conducted an independent search using ChatGPT to verify one of the citations, he found to his utter amazement that many of the cited cases were not included in any recognized legal database.The court ultimately ruled against the plaintiff, stating in the written judgment: ""The court has gained the impression that the lawyers placed false trust in the veracity of AI-generated legal research and, out of laziness, failed to check this research.""Tayla Pinto, a lawyer specializing in AI, data protection and IT law in Cape Town, sees a growing threat to the profession.""When asked how this happened and where the citations came from, the legal counsel admitted to using generative AI,"" Pinto told DW. ""This shows that the problem of lawyers not knowing how to use generative AI responsibly and ethically is growing.""According to Pinto, there are three cases in South Africa in which the legal advisers involved used AI to create their court documents.In June, there was a similar misapplication of AI in the case brought by mining company Northbound Processing against the South African Diamond and Precious Metals Regulatory Authority.This was also the case in 2023 in a defamation trial and the Pietermaritzburg High Court case, which caused a stir in court in 2024 and is now being reviewed by the Legal Practice Council and the provincial bar association.The Pietermaritzburg case was brought by Philani Godfrey Mavundla, who was suspended as mayor of the Umvoti municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. At first instance, he even prevailed against the responsible regional authority.However, the latter lodged an appeal — and his lawyers apparently blindly relied on the truthfulness of the case studies provided by the AI before the High Court.This is not a technological problem, said lawyer Pinto. ""We've always used technology in the form of calculators, spell and grammar checkers and so on. Now it's becoming a man-made problem,"" she said.""Given the way and pace at which AI is developing, if we are to use AI, we must ensure that we do so in a way that is ethical, responsible and consistent with the duties we have undertaken as a legal profession.""The court dismissed Mavundla's application to appeal the community leadership case on the grounds of a low prospect of success, and criticized the pleading of the case as flawed and unprofessional.The judge ordered Mavundla's law firm to pay the costs of additional court appearances. With this order, the court expressed its disapproval of the law firm's conduct in submitting unverified and fictitious legal evidence.A copy of the judgment was sent to the Legal Practice Council in KwaZulu-Natal for investigation and possible disciplinary action against the lawyers involved.Very few formal complaints have been lodged, although a number of matters are now starting to be referred to the Legal Practice Council (LPC) to look into, confirmed Kabelo Letebele, spokesperson for the Legal Practice Court in Johannesburg.The LPC continues to monitor developments and trends around artificial intelligence, he said. ""At this stage the LPC holds the view that there is not yet a need for a new ethical rule and that our existing rules, regulation and code of conduct are adequately to deal with complaints that regulate the usage of AI — even though the debate on this continues within the LPC,"" he told DW.According to Letebele, legal practitioners are cautioned against blindly citing case law picked up using AI tools, as instances where there are inaccuracies will be deemed as negligence and as potentially misleading to the court.He stressed that the LPC Law Library is available to the legal practitioners at no cost, and practitioners are able to verify and find latest information regarding case laws and legal research required when preparing legal matters.In addition, awareness webinars are conducted for legal practitioners to highlight specific issues and tell them how they can avoid being in contravention of rules, regulations and code of conduct of the LPC.Judges, prosecutors and court officials need to be aware that briefs and arguments can now contain not only human errors, but also AI errors.""Judges rely heavily on the submissions of lawyers during court hearings, especially on legal aspects,"" said Mbekezeli Benjamin, a human rights lawyer and speaker at Judges Matter, which advocates for more transparency and accountability.Benjamin said he was concerned lawyers were relying too heavily on the use of AI, whose susceptibility to error could mislead the court.""This significantly weakens the judicial process because, unfortunately, it creates mistrust among judges regarding the accuracy of the statements made by lawyers in their arguments,"" he said.Lawyer Tayla Pinto sees no need for specific regulation of the use of AI for judicial research, but does see a need for special attention to the review of references submitted using AI and compliance with ethical standards.However, Benjamin said warnings within the legal profession to review the use of AI tools in production were not sufficient. ""The Chamber should issue clear guidelines, including an amendment to the Code of Conduct, to regulate how AI should be used in judicial proceedings. But also make it clear that excessive reliance without reviewing AI content constitutes professional misconduct,"" he said.Benjamin also called for a revision of the profession's code of conduct so that the inappropriate use of artificial intelligence can be punished as a breach of duty with a hefty fine, or even exclusion or removal from the register of legal professionals.The South African Law Society has warned that even the inadvertent submission of false information can ruin a career.","ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI)chatbot, was intended to facilitate the work of a team of lawyers and find supplementary case examples.

August 16–26 (Late Window): After the full moon fades, skies get dark again. Meteor rates drop slightly, but viewing improves. A solid second chance if you miss the peak.

Where to Stargaze in UAE

Al Awir Desert (Dubai): Not too far from the city, but remote enough for dark skies. A popular and easy-to-access stargazing spot.

Hatta (2 hours from Dubai): Mountain air, desert surroundings, and minimal light. Great for overnight trips and casual camping.

Al Quaa Desert (Abu Dhabi): One of the darkest locations in the UAE, and ideal for serious stargazing.

Viewing Tips: How to Get the Most Out of It

Avoid city lights. Head out to a desert or low-light area.

Let your eyes adjust. It takes 20-30 minutes for full night vision.

Skip the gear. No telescope needed, meteors are best seen with your eyes.

Limit phone use. Screens ruin your night vision.

Watch for at least an hour. Meteors often come in clusters, with pauses in between.

Bonus: Milky Way Viewing on July 26

If you live in the UAE and enjoy looking up at the night sky, now’s the time. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the most anticipated night-sky events of the year, has returned. Active from July 17 to August 23, it brings bright streaks of light and fast-moving meteors across the sky, often visible without any equipment.Known for fast, bright meteors, the Perseids can produce up to 100 streaks per hour during peak nights. These ""shooting stars"" come from debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle, and they burn up high in Earth’s atmosphere, putting on a natural light show.This year, the peak falls on August 12–13, but unfortunately, it coincides with a nearly full moon. That means the sky will be brighter than ideal, which could make most of the meteors harder to see. Still, there are other dates with darker skies where you can catch the show, especially in the UAE’s wide open deserts.Each year, Earth passes through a trail of dust left by Comet Swift-Tuttle. That dust hits our atmosphere at high speed (about 60 km/second) and lights up, creating what we call meteors.The shower gets its name from the Perseus constellation, which is the point in the sky where the meteors seem to come from.But you don’t need to find it, just look up anywhere in the sky and be patient.You’ll need to get away from light pollution to see anything clearly. Here are a few recommended places:Additionally, the Dubai Astronomy Group will host a stargazing event on August 12, right during the Perseid peak. The event will include expert guidance, telescope stations, and desert camping vibes. Details are coming soon, check their site or Instagram for updates.If you're into more than just meteors, there’s an extra celestial treat this month. On Saturday, July 26, the Dubai Astronomy Group is hosting a Milky Way gazing event in Al Quaa Desert, Abu Dhabi.This event is all about taking in the full arc of the Milky Way Galaxy, which will be fully visible in the dark desert sky, with no city lights in the way. Whether you’re a seasoned astrophotographer or just want to experience a quiet night under the stars, this is a great chance to connect with the night sky.The Perseids will still be active during this time, so you may even catch a few meteors too.No. Meteors are best seen without any equipment.

TL;DR



Dubai residents must clear all traffic fines before renewing or issuing residency visas, under a new pilot system by GDRFA.



The system is designed to encourage rule-following, not punish, payment in instalments is available via RTA’s Tabby platform.



It’s not fully rolled out yet and currently excludes Dubai Airport’s GDRFA centre.



RTA now allows fines and other fees to be paid digitally across apps, kiosks, and its website with flexible plans.



System Designed with Flexibility and Convenience



Policy Meant to Promote Responsibility, Not Punishment



Not a New Concept, But Now More Digitally Integrated



FAQs:







Q: Do I need to pay all my traffic fines before renewing my Dubai visa?

Q:Can I pay in instalments if my fines are high?

Q: Is this rule applied everywhere in Dubai?

Q: Where can I pay my fines digitally?





Dubai residents must now settle all outstanding traffic fines before renewing or issuing their residency visas, under a newly piloted system launched by Dubai’s immigration and road transport authorities. This initiative is being spearheaded by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) in coordination with the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA).Accoring to reports, the rule has not been rolled out universally across all government touchpoints yet but is actively being trialled at several visa service centres, excluding the GDRFA centre at Dubai Airport. The GDRFA confirmed that the system is still in the pilot phase and is being implemented gradually.This means that any Dubai resident with unpaid traffic fines will be prompted to clear them before they can complete their visa transactions. The goal, according to officials, is not to impose restrictions but to reinforce accountability and encourage lawful conduct among residents. The system has been structured to avoid disruption, allowing payment in full or through instalment plans, depending on the individual's situation.Officials say the system is intended to be fair and manageable. Residents with large pending fines can opt to pay them off in instalments. Flexibility is a key feature of the initiative, which has been developed after extensive internal reviews and the assessment of thousands of individual cases.To make the process smooth and accessible, RTA has upgraded its digital services, integrating Tabby, a payment platform, into all its digital channels. These include the RTA website, RTA app, nol Pay app, and previously installed smart kiosks. Residents can now pay for up to 170 services, including traffic fines, vehicle licence renewals, and driving licence transactions, through Tabby’s instalment system.Tabby enables users to divide their payments into up to four instalments, significantly reducing the financial burden of lump-sum fines. The feature also covers purchases of vehicle number plates, providing added convenience across a wider range of services.Authorities have emphasised that the move is not meant to penalise residents but rather to encourage them to take responsibility for their actions and adhere to local laws. GDRFA leadership underscored that individuals who wish to live and work in Dubai are expected to follow the country’s rules and regulations.Failure to clear dues could lead to complications in the future, including difficulties when trying to exit the country. For example, individuals with fines still pending after several years might face obstacles at the time of departure, potentially being stopped at immigration checkpoints.Residents who visit GDRFA centres for visa-related services will be guided through the traffic fine settlement process. Authorities have ensured that the new approach remains resident-friendly, with the system designed to inform, assist, and offer solutions, not deny services outright.This is not the first time UAE authorities have explored the idea of linking fines with residency services. As far back as 2014, the Ministry of Interior had floated a similar initiative where traffic fines were tied to visa renewal processes.However, the current system differs by providing digital convenience, wider integration, and structured payment options, all supported by RTA’s tech-driven platforms. The enhanced ease of access makes compliance far more manageable today than it may have been in previous years.As the system moves out of its pilot phase, broader implementation is expected in the coming months. Residents are advised to regularly check for any outstanding violations and resolve them early to avoid delays in their visa procedures.Yes, under the new system, you must clear outstanding fines before your visa can be renewed or issued.Yes, you can split payments using Tabby across RTA’s digital platforms.Not yet, it’s in the pilot phase and doesn’t apply at Dubai Airport’s GDRFA centre.You can use the RTA website, app, nol Pay app, or smart kiosks for digital payments.","Dubai’s new system requires residents to settle all unpaid traffic fines, either fully or via instalments, before completing visa renewals.

Purpose: Supporting Lifestyle and Tourism Goals

Impact on Business and Patrons





Ongoing Oversight and Compliance





In a bid to elevate its culinary and hospitality standards, Saudi Arabia has introduced a new set of guidelines for fine dining establishments. The Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MOMRAH) unveiled the regulatory framework on Monday, with a clear focus on enhancing customer experience and aligning with global fine dining norms.The initiative is part of the broader Vision 2030 objectives aimed at developing lifestyle sectors, supporting the tourism industry, and promoting private-sector excellence in service delivery.Under the new classification system as mentioned in Saudi Gazette, fine dining restaurants must now adhere to a defined set of operational and visual standards. These include:The ministry clarified that these measures are designed to ensure a consistent and premium dining experience while supporting Saudi Arabia’s hospitality competitiveness on the global stage.According to the Ministry, the regulation aims to develop the classification of food establishments and support the Kingdom’s growing role as a hub for gastronomy and upscale leisure.Saudi Arabia has seen a surge in high-end restaurant openings in cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and AlUla in recent years. This regulatory step ensures that such venues maintain international-level standards while preserving cultural expectations and local identity.The guidelines also support the tourism ecosystem by standardizing the quality of visitor experiences, a key objective under Vision 2030.Fine dining operators will need to meet these criteria to either maintain or obtain their ""fine dining"" classification. The ministry may issue formal recognitions or classifications to establishments that fulfil the required conditions, potentially impacting licensing, marketing, and eligibility for future hospitality partnerships.For diners, the guidelines will make expectations clearer, especially for international visitors used to a consistent luxury dining standard.These rules are applicable only to establishments voluntarily classified or aspiring to be recognized as fine dining and not to casual eateries or cafes.The Ministry has not yet released penalties or enforcement mechanisms but stated that the classification will involve assessment visits and performance evaluations over time. Restaurant owners are encouraged to review the published guidelines and adapt accordingly.This is not the first step in raising hospitality benchmarks. Saudi Arabia has previously introduced regulations around hygiene, ingredient sourcing, and customer transparency across food-related sectors. The current update builds on those foundations to address the premium segment.Saudi Arabia’s new fine dining regulations mark another step in its push to become a global hospitality destination. By setting clear standards around design, etiquette, and service, the Kingdom is positioning itself to attract discerning customers and international culinary brands while supporting local entrepreneurship.As Vision 2030 progresses, such policies are likely to become more common across other lifestyle sectors, shaping the cultural and commercial landscape for years to come.","Saudi Arabia launches new rules for fine dining restaurants under Vision 2030.

'I am sexy enough...': Megyn Kelly fights with ex-wife of Kamala Harris' husband over JLo's sultry performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-am-sexy-enough-megyn-kelly-fights-with-ex-wife-of-kamala-harris-husband-over-jlos-sultry-performance/articleshow/122884634.cms,"Megyn Kelly fights with Doug Emhoff's ex-wife over JLO's sultry performance.





Megyn Kelly did not like JLo's suggestive dancing with three male backup dancers and called her a ""soft porn star"". But this led to a major faceoff between Megyn Kelly and Kerstin Emhoff, the ex-wife of Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff. And the exchange ended up on the issue of Doug Emhoff cheating on his first wife with the nanny.Kerstin did not agree with Megyn Kelly that JLo was overdoing her performance and that she should have acted her age. ""I bet tons of people look at Jlo and want to have sex with her. Megan - if you actually think that post-menopausal women can’t be sexual, you are missing out. You can close up your 55 year old shop while the rest of us are open for business,"" Kerstin Emhoff said.""You were too chicken shit to actually cc me on your post, @keprettybird, but let’s just say I’m sexy enough to keep my husband from sleeping with the nanny. Unlike J-Lo, however, I don’t feel the need to fake hump a bunch of strangers to prove I’ve still got it,"" Megyn Kelly said.""I’m definitely not a chicken shit @megynkelly. I assumed you would see it. You called out Jlo for her age, not the moves. You have no idea what happened in my marriage just like I have no idea what your Doug really thinks about you.But I choose to support women. Try it,"" Kerstin said.JLo was performing at the Cook Music Festival on the Canary Island of Tenerife Saturday night when she broke out a series of graphic moves during a musical interlude before performing her song “I’m Into You.”Wearing a skimpy white thong body suit with lace-up detailing, Lopez hit a series of sexually suggestive poses with her dancers as the crowd gasped. When Megyn attempted to describe footage from the concert to her listening audience, she admitted it sounded more like she was “reading the Kama Sutra” than “watching a JLo performance.”“We see heinie with a thong, and a man looks like he is giving her oral sex. His face is in her crotch,” Megyn explained. “She bends over and then, for the next several minutes, she simulates actual sex acts… with a bunch of men wearing just pants and corsets.”“She is 55 years old, and she hasn’t come to grips with the fact that she is not a sex symbol anymore,” Megyn noted. “I can say this because I will be 55 in November. We are not sex symbols. We could look great for our age… But asking the American public to look at you and be like, ‘I want to have sex when I look at her’? That ship has sailed. It sailed with menopause.”",JLo was performing at the Cook Music Festival on the Canary Island of Tenerife Saturday night when she broke out a series of graphic moves during a musical interlude before performing her song “I’m Into You” Megyn Kelly called her a'soft porn star' Kerstin Emhoff was the ex-wife of Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122884626,imgsize-28090,width-400,resizemode-4/122884626.jpg"
"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship, 'to get out of thinking'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teens-say-they-are-turning-to-ai-for-advice-friendship-to-get-out-of-thinking/articleshow/122872098.cms,"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship, 'to get out of thinking' (Image: AP)

How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers







TOPEKA: No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colours, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.The sophomore honours student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.""For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.AI is always available. It never gets bored with youMore than 70 per cent of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.""All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.""In the Common Sense Media survey, 31 per cent of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33 per cent had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement - not replace - real-world interactions.""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said.The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. The group recommends that minors not use AI companions.A concerning trend to teens and adults alikeResearchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character AI chatbot.""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.""Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.""Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper - our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.""""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it.""","Teens say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.
