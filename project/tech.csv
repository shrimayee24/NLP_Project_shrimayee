This is where Sonam Raghuvanshi grew up as the girl next door — until a horrific crime propelled her into national infamy.On Monday, outside the modest two-storey house that is Sonam’s home, women gathered, murmuring, whispering, and glancing repeatedly at their phones. Every time a new update about the Raja-Sonam tragedy flashed across screens, gasps rippled through the group.The neighbourhood is trying to come to terms with the unthinkable — that Sonam, the soft-spoken, god-fearing girl they knew since childhood, could be the mastermind behind her husband Raja Raghuvanshi’s brutal murder during their honeymoon in Shillong.“We’re still in shock,” said Reena Kushwaha, 35, sitting outside her shop. “She was always smiling, respectful, and deeply involved in religious practices. Who would have imagined she could be part of something like this?”In this middle-class locality, Sonam was not just another face in the crowd. She had grown up here—celebrated festivals with everyone, led Dandiya sessions during Navratri, fasted on religious days, and prayed daily at the small temple her family had built at her request. “She used to sit there every morning, offering flowers, lighting incense,” said one of the elderly neighbours, eyes filled with disbelief.","Sonam Raghuvanshi grew up as the girl next door in Indore’s Banganga area.

The duo’s playful videos made them regulars on the “For You” page.Beyond TikTok, Natalie has built a strong online presence. She has:On June 9, a video surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) showing Natalie outside TikTok's headquarters in tears. She was seen anxiously speaking on the phone, pleading to be let inside. The reason? Her TikTok account had been banned, and she was reportedly trying to get it reinstated. Her emotional breakdown struck a chord online, with users debating whether it was genuine distress or a publicity move.In May, Natalie faced intense criticism after a prank video showed her convincing a homeless woman to jump into Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas, for just $20.The woman allegedly didn’t know how to swim.Natalie reportedly reassured her it was part of a “scavenger hunt” and promised to jump in after her.

Redefining luxury at Monaco Grand Prix 2025

The 2025 Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix weekend was a dazzling blend of racing, music, art, and luxury. As McLaren’s Lando Norris took his maiden victory on the iconic Monte Carlo circuit, the event became much more than just a race. Celebrities and elite guests including Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, Dua Lipa, Sofia Vergara, and Odell Beckham Jr. turned Monaco into the ultimate playground of glitz and glamour. From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race. Robin Thicke opened with a private concert, followed by a surprise Sunday night set from DJ Rampa, who premiered new speakers to an electrified crowd including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.Created by Ben Biscotti and Sylvain Bitton, RD Grand Prix was designed to mix tech billionaires, royalty, and fashion icons with racing fans in a setting of unrivaled luxury. Guests enjoyed champagne on the rooftop bar, relaxed in an outdoor hot tub, shopped fashion pop-ups, and dined on cuisine by Michelin-starred chef Marc Forgione. Sponsors like RUMOR Rosé and Lewis Hamilton’s Almave spirit added to the upscale vibe. Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht. This event combined music, art, and philanthropy in an intimate, lively atmosphere. Guests like Devin Booker and Chanel Iman mingled as DJ HoneyLuv and Paperwater provided live music, while a curated art exhibit by Lisbon’s Underdogs Gallery showcased works by street artist Alexandre Farto (aka “Vhils”).The highlight was a collaborative concrete carving auctioned off by Beckham and Vhils, with proceeds benefiting Iminente’s Bairros project. This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education. Launched at the Super Bowl earlier this year, FRI&NDS aims to celebrate and support creative talent through cultural events tied to major sports and entertainment moments.Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc also made a splash during the weekend, debuting a new capsule clothing line with Ferrari Style at Nikki Beach Monte Carlo. The rooftop venue offered stunning views of both the Mediterranean and the race’s famous Fairmont Hairpin. Leclerc mingled with fans as Ferrari’s signature red branding adorned the club in celebration of Nikki Beach’s 10th anniversary.This collaboration added a fashionable edge to the Grand Prix festivities and highlighted how Monaco continues to blend sport with luxury lifestyle in unique ways.The Monaco Grand Prix has always been synonymous with luxury and exclusivity, but this year’s events took it to new heights. From Jeff Bezos’ star-studded yacht party to Odell Beckham Jr.’s fusion of art and philanthropy, and Charles Leclerc’s stylish launch, Monaco 2025 was about more than racing. It was a celebration of culture, community, and elite experiences.Event producers Biscotti and Bitton have set the bar high for future activations, with their next major event, Rosé Day Los Angeles, coming up in June.

As everyone’s geared up for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025, excitement is building among tech geeks, developers, and iPhone users. Packed with promises to be one of the biggest WWDC conferences so far, Apple is expected to introduce the most awaited iOS 26 , the future mobile operating system for iPhones. According to reports by BGR, the keynote is speculated to highlight breakthrough developments that not only improves the user experience but will also be compatible with artificial intelligence, has fluidity between cross-devices, and has a more intelligent design philosophy.Even though Apple has not publicly announced all the features, the leaks and rumors within the industry indicate a bright outlook. With AI-driven health recommendations to live translation through AirPods, iOS 26 will embark on a new path in making the iPhone smarter, smarter, and more personal.Listed below are the rumoured iOS 26 features that could completely transform your iPhone.One of the largest issues with beta software over the past few years has been instability during initial releases. Apple is said to be focusing heavily on foundational performance boosts and more refined beta testing cycles with iOS 26. This translates to fewer bugs, improved resource efficiency, and a cleaner experience across models.iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro. The new design is speculated to come with translucent features, more simplified menus, and a less prominent interface.Over the years, the Camera app has become a bit troublesome with a lot of toggles and buried options. With iOS 26, Apple can finally simplify this interface, providing a more smooth and distraction-free shooting experience.Fitness and health have been at the heart of Apple's world, but iOS 26 might take it to the next level with the launch of an AI health coach. This would take user information from the Health app and Apple Watch and create personalized fitness and wellness advice.Battery life remains a priority for iPhone users. Apple can solve this with AI-driven battery optimisation, where the operating system learns user habits and optimizes background activity accordingly.Accessing public Wi-Fi, particularly captive networks that demand login screens, can become a chore. iOS 26 might bring a shared login feature that is synced across devices with the same Apple ID.Perhaps the most awaited feature is real-time translation support in AirPods, which would possibly be driven by Apple Intelligence (Apple's own AI suite).From an improved battery life to smarter health tracking and real-time translation, the upcoming iOS 26 features seem aimed at making the iPhone not just a device, but a more intuitive extension of daily life. Stay tuned for Apple’s keynote, where all eyes will be on how many of these speculations actually become reality.","iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro.

Stephen Curry takes on GOAT alongside Hollywood stars





Stephen Curry is making his first big foray into the world of acting by joining the cast of GOAT. This animated feature from Sony Pictures Animation will also see the Golden State Warriors star as a producer. While this will be his first major role in a movie, Curry has been a part of a few projects so far. His wife, Ayesha certainly knows her way around the camera, so she could give him a few pointers if it ever came to that. For now, though, we can at least expect to hear Stephen Curry as he plays his part in GOAT.Sony revealed the main cast for GOAT on Monday, June 9. NBA superstar Stephen Curry is joining the likes of Stranger Things alums David Harbour and Caleb McLaughlin- who will play the lead character of Will, Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan, actresses Gabrielle Union (Being Mary Jane) and Jennifer Lewis (Black-ish), comedian Patton Oswalt (The Secret Life of Pets), and writer and voice actor Nick Kroll (Sing). He has also been named as a producer for the movie, alongside Erick Peyton of Unanimous Media.The action-comedy is being directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is known for animated features like Bob's Burgers (2011), Axe Cop (2012), and Motorcity (2012). The movie is set in an all-animal world, where a little goat named Will gets a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join the pros and play roarball. It is a fictionalized, high-intensity, co-ed, full-contact sport dominated by the fastest, fiercest animals in the world.And now Will the Goat gets to join them.The cast members were announced at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 9, where Sony also screened exclusive footage from GOAT for the first time. The movie is a collaboration between Sony Pictures Animation and the NBA and is set to be released on February 13, 2026, in line with the NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, which has been set for the Feb 13 to 15 weekend.Like the basketball superstar he is, Stephen Curry hopefully will take that charisma to the big screen as well, and fans will get to see their favorite in a different light doing something completely different from his usual.Also Read: ""It's extremely challenging tour to crack"" - Stephen Curry Eyes New Career Options After NBA; Golden State Warriors Star Plans Next Move","Stephen Curry is making his first big foray into the world of acting by joining the cast of GOAT.

Thesystem at Mall of the Emirates (MoE) in Dubai began on February 3, 2025. Over the weekend before launch, motorists who visited the mall received notifications regarding the implementation of the new system, which had already been activated at Deira City Centre in January, according to developer Majid Al Futtaim (MAF).The introduction of this paid parking system was first announced in October 2024 after MAF entered into a five-year contract with Parkin PJSC, the largest operator of paid public parking facilities in Dubai. Using Parkin’s seamless parking technology, the new system removes the need for barriers or tickets, allowing motorists to drive in and out without stopping or waiting.Despite the upgrade, MAF confirmed parking fees remain unchanged, stating:“Our new seamless parking upgrade promises a ticketless and barrierless experience so you can efficiently enter and exit hassle-free without any delays or concerns about lost tickets.”A key new update relates to unauthorised use of the MoE parking lot as a traffic shortcut. Some motorists have been passing through the parking area to bypass congestion in Al Barsha’s internal roads and gain quicker access to Sheikh Zayed Road.To address this, MAF has clarified that even simply passing through the Mall of the Emirates parking area is now subject to a flat charge of Dh3.Parkin’s automated camera system scans license plates to track entry and exit times.There is no need for paper tickets or mobile apps.Motorists can extend or waive their parking charges under specific conditions. These must be validated at designated customer service counters:MAF said: “There is no need to register or sign up if the vehicle is already registered in the UAE.”The system is fully integrated with UAE vehicle registration data.MAF has assured that:MAF said their system has a 99.99% accuracy rate in reading number plates.“In the unlikely scenario this happens, the motorist won't be charged,” the company added.Motorists can report issues to 800-Park (7275) or visit the Mall Customer Service Desk for help.","Motorists do not need to stop at any barriers on entry or exit.

Celebrating Eid Al Adha 2025



Over 80,000 stamps issued



A cultural welcome that resonates

Timing matters: The stamp is available during Eid week at select immigration counters.

Request it politely at immigration if it isn’t offered by default.

Keep the passport page as a souvenir (it doesn’t impact visa status).

Check availability depending on their arrival terminal, Terminals 1, 2, and 3 may vary slightly.





Passengers arriving in Dubai during the Eid Al Adha holidays are being welcomed with a specially designed passport stamp that reads ‘Eid in Dubai’, part of a festive initiative by Dubai’s General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA).The commemorative stamp, introduced at Dubai Airports and the Hatta border crossing, was designed by Brand Dubai, the creative arm of the Government of Dubai Media Office. Images shared by the Dubai Media Office show the stamp placed prominently in arriving passengers' passports, symbolising a warm, cultural welcome as they enter the country during one of the most important festivals in Islam.The GDRFA confirmed that immigration officers have been stamping passports with the unique design since the start of the holiday weekend. The initiative aligns with broader efforts to offer a meaningful and memorable entry experience for travellers.Eid Al Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, began in the UAE on Friday, June 6, following the Day of Arafah. Residents are enjoying a four-day weekend from Thursday, June 5 to Sunday, June 8.Commemorating Prophet Ibrahim's devotion, the festival is observed with special prayers and traditional animal sacrifices.Across Dubai, the holiday is being celebrated with fireworks displays, cultural performances, and festive menus in malls and public venues. Notably, Dubai Parks and Resorts is hosting fireworks visible from Riverland Dubai, enhancing the holiday atmosphere for residents and visitors alike.According to officials, more than 80,000 travellers have already received the commemorative stamp. Visitors from countries such as India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the UK, and the Philippines have shared their stamped passports on social media, describing it as a joyful and surprising gesture.Many have taken photos of the stamped pages and posted them online, tagging Dubai Airports and sharing messages of appreciation. “Arrived in Dubai and was greeted with the most beautiful Eid stamp! What a way to start the holidays,” wrote one traveller from London.Brigadier General Talal Al Shanqeeti, of the GDRFA, explained the significance of the campaign, noting that it represents the values of hospitality, tolerance, and joy that the UAE seeks to offer every visitor. The stamp is part of the wider vision to celebrate culture through simple, human-centred gestures.Immigration officers have reported strong positive feedback. Some passengers have asked specifically for the stamp, while others were moved emotionally by the thoughtful welcome.Even airlines such as Emirates and Flydubai have reported passengers asking about the stamp while still onboard.The stamp initiative serves as a small but powerful example of how Dubai blends culture with modern hospitality. For Muslim travellers observing Eid far from home or first-time visitors to the UAE, it adds a memorable personal touch to their arrival experience, turning a routine entry process into something festive and meaningful.","Eid Al Adha began in the UAE on Friday, June 6, following the Day of Arafah.

Eid Al Adha 2025: Viral escapes by sacrificial animals cause traffic jams and public safety incidents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/eid-al-adha-2025-viral-escapes-by-sacrificial-animals-cause-traffic-jams-and-public-safety-incidents/articleshow/121694409.cms,"Image composite: X

Viral moments: Humor meets havoc





Fear, not rebellion



Real injuries, real risk



A call for respect and responsibility







During Eid Al Adha, scenes of worship and tradition unfold across the Arab and Islamic world , but increasingly, so do scenes of chaos. As families attempt to carry out the sacred act of animal sacrifice, viral videos from cities like Cairo, Istanbul, and beyond have shown a different side of the holiday: calves charging through busy roads, goats leaping over market stalls, and sheep bolting down alleys with panicked owners in pursuit.As reported by Gulf News, these incidents , both comedic and alarming , have become a recurring and highly visible feature of the Eid season in urban centers, raising deeper questions around animal welfare, safety, and public conduct during religious rituals.Across social media platforms, particularly during Eid, feeds have been flooded with clips capturing the sudden escapes of sacrificial animals , usually seconds before they’re due to be slaughtered. In one widely shared video from Egypt, a terrified ram was seen darting through congested traffic, weaving swiftly between cars and motorcycles as pedestrians jumped out of its way.Other viral clips showed animals crashing into storefronts, toppling goods, and in some cases, injuring bystanders as untrained handlers lost control. One sheep reportedly jumped a vegetable stall before disappearing into a residential alley, with children and butchers giving chase.While many viewers reacted with humor, resharing the clips alongside jokes and emojis, others were uneasy about what these videos really represented.“Behind the funny videos are real people, some of whom saved for months to afford the sacrifice,” said Dr. Walid Hindi, a psychological health consultant based in Cairo. “And behind the fleeing animal is often a child frightened, a parent panicked, or a motorist in danger.”Veterinary experts say the problem isn’t disobedience, but fear. Animals are overwhelmed during Eid, especially in densely packed city areas where sensory overload is common, crowds, blood, loud noises, and heat create a high-stress environment.“When sheep smell blood, they instinctively flee. It’s fear, not disobedience,” said one veterinary expert, highlighting that many animals are handled by untrained individuals with little understanding of how to manage stress responses.The scenes might look amusing to some, but they stem from deep-rooted challenges around urban sacrifice practices, improper animal handling, and growing pressure on families trying to uphold religious traditions in tight spaces with minimal resources.The situation took a more serious turn in Turkey, where local media reported that over 14,000 people were injured during the Eid Al Adha holiday while attempting to slaughter animals without professional help. According to the country’s health minister, most of these injuries were preventable.He urged citizens to seek out trained butchers and designated slaughterhouses, warning that lack of expertise not only endangers people but also increases the suffering of the animals.Elsewhere across the Arab world, similar but smaller-scale incidents have caused traffic jams, property damage, and minor injuries, underscoring the need for safer, more organized sacrificial practices in urban areas.Beyond safety, religious scholars have expressed concern about how these incidents , and especially the viral videos , frame the ritual of sacrifice. Some believe the public sharing of these chaotic moments risks reducing a solemn act of worship into viral entertainment.“The act of sacrifice is a profound form of worship,” said Dr. Hisham Rabi’, a scholar at Egypt’s Dar Al Ifta.“It deserves solemnity , not spectacle or amusement.”His remarks point to a broader appeal for dignity, compassion, and respect in how the sacrifice is conducted, and perceived. Eid Al Adha is, at its heart, a spiritual practice rooted in devotion and empathy, not spectacle.","Viral videos from cities like Cairo, Istanbul, and beyond have shown a different side of the holiday: calves charging through busy roads, goats leaping over market stalls, and sheep bolting down alleys with panicked owners in pursuit.

Sharjah’s second mountain retreat





Far from the rolling vineyards of Tuscany or the sun-drenched slopes of southern France, grapevines are now thriving at 850 metres above sea level on the rocky, windswept slopes of Jebel Deem in Sharjah’s eastern mountains. In a landscape more known for its harsh terrain than fertile soil, the crescent-shaped Ghamam retreat has defied expectations, transforming rugged rock into a thriving vineyard, and this landmark moment unfolded at Ghamam, a new high-altitude development on Jebel Deem, where the UAE’s first mountain grape cultivation has just borne fruit.Named after the Arabic word for “ above the clouds,” the Ghamam project is part of a sweeping vision led by Sheikh Dr Sultan Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah. More than 4,500 trees, including grape vines, olives, apples, and pomegranates — have been planted on the slopes of Jebel Deem as part of the emirate’s ambitious strategy to green the mountains and cultivate food in unlikely places. Photos and videos shared bythis week captured the harvest, a moment that is both a technical milestone and a symbol of what sustainable mountain agriculture could look like in the UAE.“Its unique location provides visitors with a panoramic view of the city’s coastline and surrounding mountain valleys, offering a captivating experience and holding significant cultural and social importance,” according to documentation from the Sharjah Ruler’s office.The agricultural breakthrough is only one part of the Ghamam retreat, a crescent-shaped mountaintop destination combining farming, tourism, and leisure.The site spans 4,700 square metres and features two floors that blend mountain hospitality with immersive visitor experiences.The development serves dual purposes: showcasing high-altitude farming in action and offering a space for cultural, social, and educational engagement.Located within the Kalba region, the project adds a new layer to Sharjah’s growing reputation as a destination for innovative development. Kalba has already launched major attractions such as the Hanging Gardens, Al Hefaiyah Lake, and a landmark clock tower, positioning the city as a leading eco- and agri-tourism hub.The Ghamam harvest complements this evolution by offering aexperience for visitors, blending scenic tourism with food sustainability.The initiative also supports Sharjah’s broader environmental and economic goals. By integrating agriculture with tourism, the project creates multiple revenue streams while promoting agricultural education and sustainable practices.Supporting this remote operation is a robust infrastructure network, including 10 kilometres of newly built roads and two bridges. One connects Wadi Al Helo Tunnel to the new Sharjah-Kalba Road, while another leads directly to the peak. These roads are built to accommodate both heavy agricultural vehicles and tourist buses, ensuring safe and efficient access.Future plans in the area include a FIFA-standard stadium on Mount Daym, located 650 metres above sea level, where temperatures are projected to be 10°C cooler than the city. Alongside it, a 100-room sports tourism hotel will rise, connected to the Ghamam retreat via a dedicated pedestrian path. These additions are part of a long-term integrated mountain development strategy combining sports, hospitality, and sustainability.The Ghamam project follows the success of Al Suhub Rest Area, Sharjah’s first mountain retreat, built 600 metres above Khor Fakkan and inaugurated in 2021. Together, the two projects underscore Sharjah’s pioneering role in mountain tourism and eco-conscious development.As the UAE works toward the goals of its National Food Security Strategy 2051, initiatives like Ghamam offer a blueprint for turning difficult terrain into productive, economically viable, and environmentally sensitive landscapes.","Ghamam is the UAE’s first mountain grape cultivation project.

Most people look for love in cafés, parks, dating apps, or maybe even the supermarket. Daniela Signor? She chose funerals. Yes, funerals — the kind where people usually gather to say goodbye, not to fall in love.But Daniela wasn’t just randomly crashing these somber gatherings. She had a mission. She had her eyes on one man: Apollo Scariot, a funeral director from Pinhalzinho, a tiny town in southeastern Brazil with more hearses than dating prospects.It all started when Daniela attended a relative’s funeral about three years ago. She should’ve been grieving, but her focus was completely elsewhere — locked onto the tall, composed man orchestrating the farewell. His name? Apollo Scariot — which, let’s be honest, sounds like the hero in a steamy paperback novel.For Daniela, it was love at first sight. But instead of walking up to him like a normal person and saying, “Hey, I think you’re cute,” she cooked up a much more… dedicated strategy.She decided to keep showing up at funerals. Any funerals. Even those of people she’d never met.In Pinhalzinho, this wasn’t quite as bizarre as it sounds.With only around 2,800 people in town, it’s not unusual for distant acquaintances or complete strangers to drop in at someone’s funeral. So Daniela blended in, attending ceremonies every few months, just waiting to catch Apollo’s attention.Problem was — the man was too good at his job. He wasn’t looking for love among the mourners; he was busy making sure every flower was in place and every tear had an appropriate tissue.“I used to think, ‘I’ll give the family a hug just so I can see him,’ you know?” Daniela later told What’s the Jam.But Apollo rarely noticed her. Sometimes he wasn’t even there. Sometimes they’d exchange a polite word or two, but he never saw her as more than another grieving attendee.Still, Daniela stuck to her plan — and her patience paid off. After two years of low-key lurking, Apollo finally noticed the woman who kept popping up at his funerals. This time, he looked back. They chatted. They swapped numbers.By summer 2024, they were dating. By May 2025, they were married.And in perfect tribute to their unconventional love story, Daniela and Apollo arrived at their wedding not in a fancy car, but in a funeral hearse!","Daniela Signor decided to keep showing up at funerals.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 & Grounded 2 Direct

Microsoft just wrapped up their biggest gaming showcase of the year, and honestly? They came loaded for bear. From brand new handhelds to surprise Final Fantasy drops, this wasn't your typical ""here's what's coming eventually"" presentation. The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.The show's theme was clear: Xbox wants to be everywhere you are, whether that's your couch, your desk, or apparently now in your backpack. With every announced game supporting Xbox Play Anywhere and a shiny new handheld to show off, Microsoft is doubling down on their ""play anywhere"" philosophy in a big way.Let's break down everything that happened during this gaming extravaganza.The biggest hardware surprise came courtesy of Microsoft's partnership with Asus. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X aren't just another Steam Deck competitor, they’re Microsoft's direct answer to handheld PC gaming. Both the Ally(s) run full Windows, meaning you can access Xbox Game Pass, Steam, Battle.net, and pretty much any PC storefront you can think of.The regular Ally packs an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, while the Ally X steps things up with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme, 24GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage. Both launch this holiday season, and Microsoft made sure to mention that every game shown in the showcase will run on these handhelds. That's a bold claim, but if it holds true, these could be game-changers for portable gaming.After years of waiting, Obsidian's space RPG sequel has locked in October 29, 2025 as its launch date. The new trailer showed off the colony of Arcadia, which looks like it's having a significantly worse time than the locations in the first game. Rifts are tearing through space-time, factions are at each other's throats, and somehow capitalism is still the real villain.The sequel promises bigger RPG systems, more reactive storytelling, and full character customisation. Plus, there's an expanded Direct happening right after the showcase, so Obsidian clearly has a lot more to show. If you enjoyed the original's blend of dark humour and corporate satire, this looks like more of exactly what you want.October 21, 2025 marks the return of one of gaming's most brutally difficult action series. Ninja Gaiden 4 is a collaboration between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, which sounds like a recipe for some absolutely bonkers combat sequences. The trailer showcased new protagonist Yakumo pulling off impossible combos against hordes of enemies, with the signature weapon-switching and aerial juggling the series is known for.The game is set in near-future Tokyo, features connections to series legend Ryu Hayabusa, and promises to deliver that ""git gud or go home"" difficulty the franchise built its reputation on. If you've been missing proper character action games, this one's shaping up to be essential.Sometimes the most unexpected announcements hit the hardest, and Super Meat Boy 3D definitely qualifies. Sluggerfly and Headup Games are taking Team Meat's masochistic masterpiece and literally adding another dimension to the suffering. The early 2026 release promises all the wall-jumping, buzzsaw-dodging, death-filled gameplay that made the original a cult classic, except now you can fail spectacularly in three dimensions instead of two.The trailer showcased the same tight platforming mechanics that turned controllers into projectiles worldwide, complete with Meat Boy's quest to rescue his bandage-wrapped girlfriend from that eternally creepy fetus in a jar. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously hitting ""retry"" for the 500th time – and honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way.InXile's ambitious RPG got an extended look, and it's looking appropriately ambitious. Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, players discover that history itself has been manipulated by the city's ruler. Your solution? A time travel device that lets you hop into the past and change things, with consequences rippling forward into the present.The new trailer focused on the grittier side of Avalon, showing the downtrodden areas where gangs prey on the weak. It's a far cry from the polished upper city areas we've seen before, suggesting the game will have some real social commentary alongside its time-bending mechanics. No release date yet, but this is definitely one to watch.The final reveal of the show was perhaps the biggest surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, set in 2035. This isn't your typical modern warfare setup; the trailer suggested heavy sci-fi elements, psychological warfare, and the return of David Mason from Black Ops 2. The year 2035 apparently isn't going great for humanity, with the world ""on the brink of chaos"" following the events of previous Black Ops games.Treyarch and Raven Software are promising co-op campaign support, near-future weaponry, and the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies. The official reveal is coming this summer, but this teaser suggests the series is taking some big swings with its setting and tone.Sometimes the best announcements are the ones you can play immediately. Gears of War: Reloaded launches August 26, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can jump into a multiplayer beta starting June 13. This definitive edition of the original Gears features 4K textures, 60 FPS campaign, 120 FPS multiplayer, and full cross-play support.The remaster is coming to more platforms than any Gears game before it, including PlayStation 5. It's a smart move from Microsoft, using one of their biggest exclusives to showcase their multi-platform strategy while giving longtime fans the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.Obsidian's surprise sequel announcement came with an immediate Early Access date, July 29, 2025. Grounded 2 moves the action from a single backyard to the larger Brookhollow Park, featuring new biomes, new bugs, and one of the community's most requested features: rideable vehicles called Buggies.The game promises major quality-of-life improvements over the original, including an all-in-one Omni-Tool that should streamline the building and crafting systems. With over 25 million players shaping the first game's development, this sequel feels like a direct response to community feedback.In the showcase's biggest surprise drop, Final Fantasy XVI is available on Xbox platforms right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. The game that many considered a permanent PlayStation exclusive just became part of Xbox's catalog, complete with Xbox Play Anywhere support and cross-save functionality.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is following this winter, meaning Xbox players will soon have access to some of the most acclaimed JRPGs of recent years. Microsoft made sure to point out that every mainline single-player Final Fantasy is now playable on Xbox platforms, which is a pretty impressive collection to have.Three RPGs caught attention for their unique approaches to familiar genres. Aniimo is an open-world creature collecting game that lets players actually transform into the creatures they capture through something called the Twining system. It's hitting 2026 with a closed beta coming later this year.Aphelion from Don't Nod (Life is Strange, Jusant) is a sci-fi adventure about an astronaut stranded on a frozen planet. What makes it special is its partnership with the European Space Agency, promising gameplay grounded in real science. Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak takes players to post-apocalyptic Japan with a cursed protagonist and her loyal dog companion fighting massive creatures.All three games are coming in 2026.Quarter Up announced Invincible VS , a 3v3 tag fighter based on the hit comic and animated series. The trailer showed appropriately brutal superhero combat with characters like Mark, Thula, and Atom Eve beating the absolute stuffing out of each other. It's coming in 2026 and looks like it could scratch that Marvel vs. Capcom itch.Mudang: Two Hearts is a tactical action game set in a reunified Korea, following a North Korean operative and a K-pop idol whose paths cross during terrorist attacks. The cinematic presentation and Unreal Engine 5 visuals make it one to watch for 2026.Persona 4 Revival got the briefest of teases, literally about seven seconds of footage, but it's enough to confirm that Atlus is giving the beloved JRPG a full remake treatment. No release date yet, but seeing those updated visuals of Inaba was enough to get fans excited.Three major Xbox exclusives are getting substantial content drops. The Elder Scrolls Online is continuing its Worm Cult storyline with new content arriving June 18. Fallout 76 added fishing with the Gone Fission update, because apparently even post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers need to relax sometimes.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting The Order of Giants DLC on September 4, taking Indy beneath the streets of Rome for a new adventure.The most anticipated indie game of the decade got its briefest of mentions, but sometimes that's all you need to send a fanbase into overdrive. Hollow Knight: Silksong appeared during the ROG Xbox Ally segment with a simple promise: it'll be available ""at launch and in Game Pass"" when the handheld arrives later this year. No new footage, no release date, just the confirmation that Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel is still breathing.The game's developer quickly clarified that Silksong isn't tied to the console's release and will arrive ""before Holiday,"" which has fans cautiously optimistic that Christmas 2025 might finally deliver the Metroidvania sequel they've been waiting years for. After countless delays and radio silence, even this tiny update feels like a victory for the Silksong faithful who've been subsisting on hope and memes for far too long.Phil Spencer closed the show by looking ahead to 2026 and Xbox's 25th anniversary. The confirmed lineup includes a new Fable, the next Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and what Spencer called ""the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning."" Most fans are interpreting that last tease as Halo-related, possibly a Combat Evolved remake or remaster.It's a strong lineup for Xbox's quarter-century celebration, mixing beloved franchises with what sounds like a major nostalgic announcement.
