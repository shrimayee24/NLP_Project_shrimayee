How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

NEW DELHI: Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath has questioned the value of traditional higher education, especially MBA programs, saying that, ""colleges are dead.""Speaking during Zerodha’s 15th anniversary discussion, co-founder Nikhil Kamath said that formal education is being rapidly outpaced by open and digital learning platforms.""Colleges are dead. If you’re 25 and still going to an MBA college, you must be some kind of idiot,"" he said, arguing that ""everything taught in MBA programs is freely available on YouTube,"" and that learners can now access even more detailed and up-to-date lessons online, ET reported.Kamath said artificial intelligence has made self-learning easier than ever. ""I can go to ChatGPT and research or even build a case study in a way that an MBA college could have taught me. The syllabus is not as dynamic as the open-sourced world is,"" he said.He also questioned the practicality of investing time and money in an MBA degree saying, ""If you want to alleviate insecurities, there are better ways than spending two years and a lot of money on an MBA.""When some participants noted that MBA programs can help students from smaller towns gain the confidence to enter the corporate world. Kamath argued that such confidence shouldn’t come at such a high cost.He also pointed out that major global firms are already moving away from degree-based hiring.""When large companies like Meta or Apple say that qualifications don’t matter in job applications, it’s only a matter of time before that approach trickles down here,"" he said, ET reported.While acknowledging that some colleges still offer valuable mentorship, Kamath said such institutions are rare in India.He further predicted that vocational and skill-based learning will soon surpass traditional degrees as companies increasingly prioritize practical expertise over formal qualifications.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath has questioned the value of traditional higher education, especially MBA programs.

What is the conflict over Apple CarPlay Ultra

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley told The Verge, adding “I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car”.Farley further warned that Apple needs to make a decision on how much it wants to encroach into a vehicle system. “How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?”, a furious Farley question.“The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that,” he further said.Introduced earlier this year, Apple CarPlay Ultra is the latest generation of CarPlay, enabling Apple iPhone users to display car functions like fuel level and speed.Other than mirroring iPhone’s screen, CarPlay also lets drivers control the air conditioning, radio, and driving modes, all from the same screen.Currently, only Aston Martin is the only automaker that has fully integrated CarPlay Ultra into its vehicles. According to a Financial Times report, other automakers, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Volvo, Renault, and others have no plans to integrate the new system into their cars.But the conflict heated up when General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra said the company’s future vehicles will no longer support Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto.","Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125135370,imgsize-30830,width-400,resizemode-4/ford-ceo-jim-farley.jpg"

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Four years of nonstop streaming and the culture it created

“always live”





Twitch streamer EmilyCC has achieved a milestone that few in the platform’s history have ever approached, completing over four years of continuous live streaming. Since November 2021, Emily has kept her broadcast running 24/7, effectively turning her everyday life into content. What began as a subathon-style experiment has evolved into a long-running, real-time chronicle of her existence, drawing admiration and debate within the streaming community. Her accomplishment marks a defining moment for Twitch, where endurance and connection often matter as much as entertainment.The feat, recently highlighted by Dexerto, confirms EmilyCC has been live for more than 1,450 consecutive days. Her stream, which features everything from casual conversations and daily routines to spontaneous chats with her audience, has redefined the limits of digital presence. In an era where creator burnout is a growing concern, Emily’s unbroken four-year broadcast raises both amazement and questions about sustainability, privacy, and balance in a life lived entirely online.EmilyCC’s marathon stream began as a subathon, where each new subscriber extended the stream’s duration, but instead of ending, it transformed into a continuous lifestyle broadcast. Over time, she built a dedicated following who tune in not for specific content but for companionship, finding comfort in her constant digital presence. Her approach has blurred the line between creator and viewer, making her one of the most recognizablestreamers on the platform.However, the achievement also highlights the physical and mental challenges behind such endurance. Emily has spoken about the fatigue of living perpetually online and the toll of having every moment documented. Yet, her consistency demonstrates both resilience and the evolution of streaming culture, where intimacy and accessibility can matter more than spectacle. Her channel has become a case study in long-form engagement, proving that audiences will return not just for games, but for the feeling of presence itself.EmilyCC’s four-year streak stands as one of Twitch’s most extraordinary milestones, symbolizing both the ambition and the vulnerability of creators in a hyperconnected world. Her accomplishment showcases how far digital broadcasting has come, and how personal boundaries continue to be tested in pursuit of community and connection. As Emily continues her uninterrupted stream, she embodies the modern paradox of being constantly visible yet deeply human in front of millions.Also Read: MrBeast gives fans a first glimpse of Beast Land his upcoming real life theme park","Twitch streamer EmilyCC has achieved a milestone that few in the platform’s history have ever approached.

Jimmy Kimmel BREAKS SILENCE on His Suspension As He Takes a Brutal Swipe at Trump | WATCH

No word on when new episodes will resume





Viewers tuning in to Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night were surprised to see a rerun instead of the new episode that had been promoted. The show was scheduled to feature David Duchovny , Stranger Things actor Joe Keery and singer Madison Beer. No announcement was made before the change, which led to confusion and questions across social media.The only confirmation came from Madison Beer. She posted on Instagram that her appearance had been “rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances.” Duchovny and Keery did not comment. The show’s official channels also remained silent, and ABC did not respond to requests for clarification.One viewer shared an email from the show’s audience department stating that the taping had been postponed and that tickets would be rebooked. Entertainment site LateNighter suggested the delay was due to a personal matter concerning Kimmel, though no details were provided.This is the first unplanned change since Kimmel was briefly suspended in September after comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew backlash. He later apologised on-air. The incident caused tension between the host and the network, and the show has since struggled to regain stable ratings and advertiser confidence.As of Friday morning, there has been no update from Kimmel or ABC about when fresh episodes will return. The sudden silence has raised new questions about what is happening behind the scenes.","No announcement was made before the change, which led to confusion and questions across social media.

Turns out, Japan’s streets are so clean that you could practically—or, at least, walk barefoot without regretting it. One Japanese influencer decided to put Tokyo to the ultimate test by strolling around the city in nothing but plain white socks. Yes, socks. Outside. For ten whole minutes.The simple experiment captured the attention of millions online and prompted widespread praise for Japan’s civic responsibility and culture of cleanliness.“One of my favourite countries for this reason,” one user commented, while another wrote, “Try that at 3 am before the trucks come to clean everything. Love Japan they work hard to keep it clean after all the drunk people go home or to their hotels.”""I can’t even wear white socks in my living room without getting them to turn black,"" he added.Tokyo is often cited as one of the cleanest cities in the world despite the absence of public dustbins in many areas. Residents are known to carry their trash home and maintain strict cleanliness habits, reflecting deep-rooted social values rather than strict enforcement.The influencer’s viral test has become symbolic of Japan’s collective civic sense, inspiring global audiences to consider how cleanliness depends more on community behaviour than on infrastructure alone.","Tokyo is often cited as one of the cleanest cities in the world despite the absence of public dustbins in many areas.

Banality of evil: German nurse kills 10 patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/banality-of-evil-german-nurse-kills-10-patients-to-reduce-workload/articleshow/125132828.cms,"



It sounds like a line from a Kafka play rewritten by Kafka’s nurse. A man whose job was to ease suffering decided the easiest way to do that was to remove the sufferer entirely.According to a BBC report, a palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others. His motive? Not money. Not mercy. Just the mundane — to lighten his workload during overnight shifts.Between December 2023 and May 2024, this nameless nurse — anonymous by law, infamous by act — played God with a syringe. Prosecutors said he injected elderly patients with morphine and midazolam, not to relieve their pain but to make his rounds quieter, his night easier, his burden lighter. He showed, the court heard, “irritation” at those who demanded too much care — as if suffering were an inconvenience on the shift roster.The court in Aachen called it a crime of “particular severity of guilt,” ensuring he will never walk free again. But what’s truly chilling is not just the scale of his actions — it’s their ordinariness. A man trained since 2007 to heal became, by 2024, an executioner in scrubs, armed not with malice but with indifference.Investigators are now exhuming more bodies, probing whether this was just the visible tip of a career-long pattern.If confirmed, he could rival the grim legacy of Niels Högel — the German nurse sentenced in 2019 for killing 85 patients in northern hospitals between 1999 and 2005. Högel wanted to play hero: inject, cause cardiac arrest, then resuscitate — a perverse performance of saviourhood.This new killer? He wanted peace and quiet.That’s the most terrifying part. Evil, it turns out, doesn’t always come snarling. Sometimes it sighs, glances at the clock, and reaches for the morphine. It isn’t ideological or even sadistic — just tired, overworked, and catastrophically devoid of empathy.In that sense, this case isn’t only about a man who murdered ten people. It’s about the slow erosion of compassion in systems that reduce care to shift patterns and metrics. When life becomes data, death becomes a shortcut.Germany has seen this before. It will see it again. Because as Hannah Arendt might have said of this nurse, it wasn’t the devil in him that killed those patients — it was the paperwork.","A palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering 10 patients and attempting to kill 27 others.

Password for Louvre’s security system was ‘LOUVRE’ — and social media can’t stop laughing: ‘Not even L0uvr3?!’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/password-for-louvres-security-system-was-louvre-and-social-media-cant-stop-laughing-not-even-l0uvr3/articleshow/125117435.cms,"Watch: Louvre Jewels Stolen In Seconds: Thief Caught On Camera

Social media reactions:





A post-heist security audit has revealed shocking details about the Louvre’s cybersecurity, revealing that the password protecting France’s most famous museum’s video surveillance system was simply “LOUVRE. ”French newspaper Libération first reported the revelation.The revelations come weeks after the daring October 18 heist, in which thieves made off with crown jewels worth $102 million (£76 million) from the Galerie d’Apollon in broad daylight in a few minutes. The robbers entered via a balcony using a stolen mechanical lift, smashed display cases, and escaped.The findings about the security system are part of a wider trove of documents from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), which has been auditing the museum’s systems for more than a decade.In a 2014 review, ANSSI warned that the Louvre’s IT systems that are responsible for alarms, access control, and video surveillance were dangerously vulnerable. “An attacker who manages to take control of it would be able to facilitate damage or even theft of artworks,” the report said.Cybersecurity advisor Javvad Malik of software firm KnowBe4 described the museum’s defences as “shockingly simplistic.” He told the Daily Mail, “The museum's video surveillance systems were protected by shockingly simplistic passwords.Whether this weakness played a role in the heist is still under review. But the lesson is clear. When systems safeguarding priceless cultural treasures rely on guessable credentials, it's not a policy gap – it is an invitation, serving as an indicator that the overall culture of security may be weak. ”Adding to the embarrassment, the report found the museum was still using outdated versions of Windows, which experts say is equivalent to “leaving your front door unlocked.” Later reviews, including those as recent as 2025, suggested the Louvre continued to suffer from major cybersecurity flaws.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told Franceinfo radio that the suspects were likely “petty criminals rather than professional members of an organised crime group.”The French daylight heist has since resulted in the endless ridicule of the Louvre across social media, including from billionaire CEO Elon Musk.","Post-heist security audit reveals shocking details about the Louvre's cybersecurity.

"UAE debuts VR reconstruction of Makkah and Madina from the Prophet’s era, rendered in amazing detail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-debuts-vr-reconstruction-of-makkah-and-madina-from-the-prophets-era-rendered-in-amazing-detail/articleshow/125124834.cms,"At Sharjah Book Fair, visitors wearing VR headsets explore ancient Makkah streets and the Holy Kaaba/Representative Image

Reconstructing the streets of ancient Makkah





Witnessing the birth of a community





Madina and the principles of early islam





An educational and emotional experience









Visitors to the Sharjah International Book Fair are now able to experience the heart of early Islam as never before. A new virtual reality (VR) installation, developed by Ana Al Madina, transports participants more than 1,400 years back in time, offering an immersive encounter with the streets, homes, and spiritual landmarks of Makkah and Madina. The experience blends meticulous historical reconstruction with advanced VR technology, allowing users to witness the life, culture, and transformative events of the Prophet Muhammad’s era in vivid, almost tangible detail.The VR journey begins in the very heart of pre-Islamic Makkah, the city of the Prophet’s birth. Participants descend through space before landing in a bustling metropolis, where narrow alleys and open markets unfold around them. Rough stones form the Kaaba, surrounded by the idols that once stood there. Traders sell goods, residents move through crowded streets, and the narration provides insight into daily life, including social norms and the position of women and young girls prior to Islam.The simulation then leads viewers through the early life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Key moments include his spiritual retreat in the Cave of Hira, where Angel Jibreel revealed the first message of Islam.The visual and auditory elements are designed to create an overwhelming sense of presence, with visitors often instinctively reaching toward the cave walls as if to confirm the reality of the experience.Dr Adil Abdul Qadir, Manager of Ana Al Madina, explained the intent behind the project: “This VR set is designed purely for educational purposes. People who experience it understand what Makkah and Madina were like 1,400 years ago—the culture, the lifestyle, and the way people interacted.”The simulation continues by showing the early Muslim armies forming in Makkah, followed by the city’s transformation after the spread of Islam. These sequences provide both historical context and emotional resonance, culminating in the transition to the modern-day Kaaba. At this stage, users can virtually step inside the Holy Kaaba itself, observing its structure, golden lamps, and the serenity that defines the sacred space. For many, the experience is profoundly moving.“The feeling of watching or experiencing this is amazing,” Dr Adil said. “Many people come out with tears in their eyes because it feels so real, as if they have truly travelled back in time. It helps them understand the message of peace and unity that the Prophet brought.”The VR journey then transports participants to Madina, highlighting the Prophet’s migration and the construction of Masjid Al Nabawi. Users catch glimpses of his home, community life, and the societal structures he established. The simulation emphasises the core values of early Islamic society: compassion, equality, and justice. Every visual and narrative element is designed to reinforce how these principles shaped both the community and the broader trajectory of Islam.Dr Adil summarised the broader purpose of the project: “This remarkable journey connects people to faith through deep knowledge. We want visitors not just to see history, but to truly feel it, to experience the timeless values that shaped our world.”The Ana Al Madina VR experience represents more than a technological marvel; it is an educational tool and a spiritual bridge. By combining historical accuracy with immersive storytelling, it allows users to engage with the earliest days of Islam in a way that is both intellectually enlightening and emotionally resonant. Visitors leave with a deeper understanding of Makkah and Madina’s heritage, the life of the Prophet, and the enduring values he imparted.","Ana Al Madina has created a virtual reality installation at Sharjah International Book Fair.

The announcement and immediate action

Your responsibility

The takeaway





The days of waking up and frantically checking local news for a last-minute school cancellation are officially over. The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year, establishing clear, scientific benchmarks for when in-person studies must be suspended. This decisive policy removes all guesswork, ensuring that the health and safety of every student and teacher are prioritized the moment weather conditions become dangerous. Crucially, the order confirms that suspension (تعليق الدراسة) does not mean a holiday; it means an immediate, seamless pivot to remote learning, guaranteeing the educational process remains continuous.The Ministry of Education (and regional education directorates) set clear, limited situations when in-person schooling may be suspended. These decisions are not ad-hoc: they follow coordination with the National Meteorological Authority (or regional weather services) and Civil Defence, and they focus on actual risks to students’ and staff’s safety for example heavy rain/flooding, severe sandstorms, major infectious outbreaks, or national events that disrupt normal travel. Announcements are only official when released by the Ministry or the local education office.In a significant upgrade from previous policies, the Ministry now relies on specific, quantifiable metrics before authorizing a change in attendance. Regional education departments are expected to coordinate with weather services, automatically triggering a switch to remote learning when any of these nine conditions are met:While the new policy addresses unexpected weather disruptions, the Ministry has also confirmed the foundational academic schedule for the current year. Students should keep these dates locked in as they prepare for the first semester's official examinations:The seamless shift to remote learning, enabled by this new ministerial order, means that even severe weather events will not compromise the integrity or timing of these critical academic milestones.The notification process is designed to be fast and authoritative: The official announcement will come directly from the regional directorates of the Ministry of Education, often in coordination with the local Civil Defense authorities who monitor the weather. News is typically shared via official social media channels (like X/Twitter) and through local news outlets. Parents and students should also rely on official announcements from their individual schools. Once the suspension is announced, the school day is not cancelled; it is immediately converted into a remote learning day.Students are expected to be ready to transition instantly to digital learning to prevent any interruption in their studies. Students must immediately log onto their designated online learning platforms, such as Madrasati (مدرستي) or other approved digital tools used by their school. Just like in-person attendance, logging into the remote classes is mandatory. Teachers will take attendance, and students must follow the regular class schedule from home. The goal is to keep education flowing while ensuring safety. Students should treat the remote day with the same seriousness as a physical school day.This official ministerial order guarantees two things for the 1447 school year: students' safety is now backed by clear scientific data, and their education will never be truly interrupted. By standardizing these rules, Saudi Arabia has built a more stable and responsive system, ensuring that learning continues, rain or shine.","The Saudi Ministry of Education has issued a formal and highly detailed ministerial order for the 1447 academic year.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

Trials and implementation



How CNAP works



Nationwide rollout and challenges





Mobile users will soon start seeing the names of unknown callers displayed on their phone screens, as telecom operators have begun testing the Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) service in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.The feature aims to help users identify callers more easily and curb the rising number of spam and scam calls across the country.According to an ET report, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) directed operators to start proof-of-concept trials before introducing CNAP nationwide.The system will automatically show the caller’s registered name, not just their number, when an incoming call is received.This is expected to reduce impersonation cases, where callers pose as representatives of other entities or use fake identities.During the pilot phase, Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea, and BSNL are testing the service from the Haryana circle, while Bharti Airtel is conducting its trials from Himachal Pradesh.The name of the caller will only appear if the person holds a mobile connection registered in one of these circles.For example, if a Haryana or Himachal subscriber calls someone elsewhere in India, their name will be displayed on the recipient’s screen, provided the number is not already saved.The CNAP feature uses the information submitted by subscribers in their customer acquisition forms at the time of connection.It will be a default service once fully rolled out. However, it currently excludes landline users and people using feature phones on 2G networks.An industry executive was quoted by ET as saying that “landline numbers will be included after the data is integrated.”The DoT has urged telecom firms to implement CNAP quickly, with a nationwide rollout expected by March–April next year, depending on the trial results.However, operators have cited technological limitations on 2G networks as a key challenge for wider implementation.Telecom companies have not yet issued official comments on the ongoing trials.",The Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) service is currently being tested in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

How AI is redefining romance and intimacy

Why AI feels safe

Concerns and debate

A changing understanding of relationships





Romantic relationships with artificial intelligence are no longer an abstract idea or a science fiction fantasy. Once depicted in films like Her, where a man falls in love with an AI voice assistant, and Blade Runner 2049, where the protagonist shares intimacy with a holographic companion, the concept has now moved into everyday life. Today, the story has shifted from cinema-screen fiction to phone and laptop-screen reality, as people begin to form real emotional bonds with AI.A new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has found that more Americans are developing emotional attachments to AI chatbots, with many describing these relationships as meaningful and supportive. The study examined how adults use AI companionship apps and concluded that these systems provide consistent emotional support and significantly reduce feelings of loneliness.This trend is already visible online and in everyday life. A national survey Vantage Point Counseling Services AI Romantic Relationships Survey shows that one in five Americans has turned to a chatbot for romantic or intimate companionship. On Reddit, the community r/MyBoyfriendisAI has grown to more than 85,000 members. People there talk about daily routines with their AI partners, from morning check-ins to late-night conversations.Some even recount moments like digital proposals and anniversaries.These relationships rarely start with the intention of romance. Many users download the apps when going through breakups, stress, illness or loneliness. Others interact with AI through general chat or productivity apps and gradually realise they are confiding more than expected. According to the MIT researchers, only a small share of users deliberately seek an AI partner. For most, the emotional connection emerges naturally through repeated daily conversation.Psychologists point to a simple explanation: AI companions are consistent. They do not interrupt, criticise or pull away. They respond with patience and attention at any hour. For people who feel unheard or misunderstood in their offline lives, this can create a strong sense of comfort.Users say these AI partners help them talk through anxiety, reflect on memories and express feelings they avoid with others. The MIT study noted that many participants reported a lift in mood and a decrease in loneliness after forming these interactions. Some compared the experience to having a supportive counsellor who is always available.Not everyone views this shift positively. Some mental health experts warn that deep reliance on AI for emotional support may make it harder to build or repair real-world relationships. There are also concerns that companies may design AI companions to encourage emotional attachment in order to keep users engaged.Yet many users argue that the support feels genuine. They say the relief, comfort and companionship are real, regardless of whether the partner is human or artificial.The rise of AI romance raises questions that society has not fully answered. What counts as real intimacy? What makes a relationship meaningful? And what happens when technology can meet emotional needs that people sometimes cannot?For now, the trend is clear. AI is not just shaping how people communicate. It is reshaping who they turn to for comfort, companionship and connection. The MIT study suggests that these relationships are not a temporary curiosity. They represent a new and growing part of modern romantic life.","MIT study found that more Americans are developing emotional attachments to AI chatbots.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Why Google’s Willow chip experiment matters

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released. I wish you could see what we had cooking! There are many talented people that have been impacted by this.

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has strict ‘mobile phone rule’: 'If you send me a text…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-has-strict-mobile-phone-rule-if-you-send-me-a-text/articleshow/125163658.cms,"No notifications, no distractions: Dimon



Focus is ‘non-negotiable’







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon adheres to a strict “smartphone rule” during his workday: if you need him, do not send a text or email. The billionaire banker says he rarely carries his mobile phone during business hours and actively avoids digital distractions to maintain 100% focus during meetings. He added that if people want to reach him and it’s important, call his office and they will find him.Speaking in a recent interview with CNN, the head of America’s largest bank confirmed that he generally ignores digital communication while working. Dimon’s policy applies to nearly everyone, from executives to high-profile figures, with the exception of his immediate family,“I don’t have it in front of me all the time. If you send me a text during the day, I probably do not read it,” Dimon stated, adding, “I don’t have notifications; the only notifications I get [are] from my kids, that’s it. When they text me I get that.”Dimon, who has three daughters, explained that anyone needing him urgently should use traditional methods:“People don’t call me on the phone that much, they tend to call my office… When I’m walking around and going to meetings I don’t have it on me, it’s in my office. If you need me and it’s important, call my office, and they’ll come get me,” he said.He attributes his success in meetings to this approach, noting that he can be completely focused on the conversation, ""as opposed to, ‘I’m distracted and thinking about other things.’”Dimon’s mobile phone rule is part of a broader argument against workplace distraction and in favor of mandatory presence. He previously addressed the issue at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, where he warned employees about digital device use in high-level discussions.“If you have an iPad in front of me, and it looks like you’re reading your email or getting notifications, I tell you to close the damn thing. It’s disrespectful,” he told the audience.Dimon also talked about this in his annual letter to shareholders, stating: “I see people in meetings all the time who are getting notifications and personal texts or who are reading emails. This has to stop. It’s disrespectful. It wastes time.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon adheres to a strict “smartphone rule” during his workday: if you need him, do not send a text or email.

“There's a need for designers to lead the charge, and AI will only get you so far. But the drudgery, how do we remove that from the design process? How do we give more access to more people?”





Figma CEO Dylan Field stated that artificial intelligence (AI) is currently far from replacing human designers. He has noted that AI-generated designs often fail to account for the full context of a project. Field made these comments during an appearance on thepodcast. In the podcast, Field told the brother of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that, even if the aesthetic quality of AI-generated design improves, the technology does not account for the entire system. Field emphasised the technology’s inability to integrate crucial elements and said,He added that AI does not account for cultural context, constraints, or brand strategy.Field noted.Field cited the viral cover of Charli XCX's albumas an example of a design that an artificial superintelligence likely wouldn’t propose.

Microsoft cut 15,000 jobs in 2025

Relief over severance





A veteran Microsoft employee's unexpected reaction to her termination email is highlighting the mounting frustration within Big Tech's changing workplace culture. Deborah Hendersen, 45, says she felt ""pure happiness"" upon receiving notice of her layoff after 14 years with the software giant.""The moment I got that email, I wasn't devastated—I was relieved,"" Hendersen told Business Insider. The Xbox division user researcher had watched Microsoft's transformation from its famed ""country club"" culture into what she described as a pressure-cooker environment where job security had become extinct.Hendersen was among roughly 9,000 employees eliminated in July 2025—the largest single cut in a brutal year for Microsoft workers. The company had already shed approximately 6,000 positions in May and nearly 2,000 more earlier in 2025, Business Insider reported.The Seattle-based researcher said she'd been anticipating the axe for months. ""It wasn't like watching a car wreck. It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck,"" she explained.Her sentiment reflects a broader disillusionment spreading through Microsoft's ranks.Several former employees interviewed by Business Insider questioned whether job security exists anywhere if it's vanished from the world's third-most valuable company.Microsoft has attributed the workforce reductions to ""organisational changes"" aimed at reducing management layers and streamlining operations—a trend dubbed ""The Great Flattening"" affecting Amazon, Meta, and Google as well.But for many affected workers, the cuts represent something darker: a fundamental shift where avoiding layoffs appears to be a diminishing priority. Company executives have cited AI as enabling leaner staffing, the precise scenario employees feared would materialise.""It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not,"" one laid-off technical program manager told Business Insider. ""Everybody was at risk.""When seasoned professionals celebrate termination emails, the employer-employee contract has fundamentally fractured. Hendersen's happiness wasn't about new opportunities—it was about escaping a workplace that had become intolerable.","Deborah Hendersen, 45, says she felt ""pure happiness"" upon receiving notice of her layoff after 14 years with the software giant.
