""I do think AI and robotics will lead to a surplus and massively increased economy in 10 years.""

“I think Peter’s guess is low by a large margin.”

What Peter Thiel said about AI’s impact on economy

“Well, I don't know. There are a lot of layers to this. One question we can frame is: Just how big a thing do I think A.I. is? And my stupid answer is: It's more than a nothing burger, and it's less than the total transformation of our society. My placeholder is that it's roughly on the scale of the internet in the late '90s. I'm not sure it's enough to really end the stagnation. It might be enough to create some great companies. And the internet added maybe a few percentage points to the maybe 1% to GDP growth every year for 10, 15 years. It added some to productivity. So that's roughly my placeholder for AI.”

“I had a conversation with Elon a few weeks ago about this. He said we're going to have a billion humanoid robots in the U.S. in 10 years. And I said: Well, if that's true, you don't need to worry about the budget deficits because we're going to have so much growth, the growth will take care of this. And then — well, he's still worried about the budget deficits. This doesn't prove that he doesn't believe in the billion robots, but it suggests that maybe he hasn't thought it through or that he doesn't think it's going to be as transformative economically, or that there are big error bars around it. But yeah, there's some way in which these things are not quite thought through.”

"What is China's mosquito drone? Capable of capturing images, audio & electronic signals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-mosquito-drone-capable-of-capturing-images-audio-electronic-signals-details/articleshow/122090220.cms,"Representative AI image





NEW DELHI: China showcased a miniature, insect-like drone designed for covert surveillance missions, drawing global attention and concern over its potential military and espionage uses.Developed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), the drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It was unveiled on the Chinese military broadcaster CCTV-7 as part of an exhibit on next-generation robotic systems.In a demonstration aired over the weekend, NUDT student researcher Liang Hexiang held up the ultra-light robot and said, “Here in my hand is a mosquito-like type of robot. Miniature bionic robots like this one are especially suited to information reconnaissance and special missions on the battlefield.”The drone, resembling a real mosquito, is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. It can reportedly operate silently and without radar detection, carrying ultra-miniature cameras and microphones to capture images, sounds, and electronic signals. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.According to The Defense Post, the device’s compact build enables it to evade conventional detection systems and operate in confined spaces — a feature that has raised alarms among privacy advocates and military analysts.Experts warn that such drones could be exploited for espionage, cyber intrusions, or even biological warfare.“This could mean greater access to restricted areas such as secure government facilities,” noted Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. “If China is able to produce mosquito-sized drones, it would likely be interested in using them for various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks, especially in places that larger drones struggle to access, such as indoor areas. These drones could be used to track individuals or listen in on conversations.”Other experts are raising more dystopian concerns. Tracey Follows, a futurist and former Google advisor, told The Sun that such drones could be used for “untraceable murders” or carry pathogens, referencing a Black Mirror episode in which robotic insects were weaponised for targeted killings. “In time, one expects a drone to have the situational awareness to carry out an attack autonomously without a human in the loop,” she said. “The big question is what's the payload on these drones, what are you actually attaching to the drone?”The mosquito-sized UAV is part of a broader NUDT programme exploring micro-robotics, with parallel developments including artillery-launched drones that can survive the extreme conditions of being fired from 155mm cannon shells. These innovations reflect China’s ambition to lead in micro-UAV technology, a field seeing increasing global competition.Other countries have made strides in this area. Norway’s Black Hornet, developed by Teledyne FLIR Defence, is already used by militaries worldwide. The latest version, the Black Hornet 4, won the 2025 Blue UAS Refresh award from the US Department of Defence for advancements in battery life, signal range, and wind resistance. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s RoboBee project has demonstrated insect-sized drones that can transition from water to air and even perch on surfaces using static electricity.Beyond military applications, microdrones are being explored for civilian use in medicine, agriculture, and disaster response. In healthcare, they could enable precision drug delivery or internal imaging. In environmental monitoring, their small size allows access to hazardous zones during floods, fires, or chemical spills.Still, with their stealth capabilities and growing autonomy, these tiny machines are poised to become one of the most ethically and strategically complex technologies of the decade.","The drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams.

Will Dubai’s 20-minute city vision melt under extreme summer heat? Is there a plan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-dubais-20-minute-city-vision-melt-under-extreme-summer-heat-is-there-a-plan/articleshow/122119952.cms,"Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat (Representative Image)





How Expo City is Tackling the Heat



In winter: Encouraging walking through interactive, engaging spaces





In summer: Introducing climate-adapted solutions such as:



Climate-responsive urban design such as enclosed cool spaces



Shaded walking routes



Smart mobility hubs for bicycles and e-scooters



Electric vehicles to support inclusive and multi-modal mobility







Don’t Forget the Old Neighborhoods



Sustaining the Vision: Making 20-Minute Cities Work in the Real World

Reduced traffic congestion





Improved quality of life





Lower carbon emissions





Greater walkability and livability









Dubai is pushing forward with its ambitious goal of building “20-minute cities”: neighborhoods where residents can access 80% of their daily needs, such as work, school, shops, and parks, within a 20-minute walk, bike ride, or public transport trip. This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes that while artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform many industries, some jobs may remain uniquely human. In a response to a question posted by Peter H. Diamandis – Executive Chairman @XPRIZE on X (formerly Twitter), Musk said: ‘There will be a premium for human experiences”. Diamandis, in the X post, asked the following question: “Which jobs will AI not be able to automate?”.Musk’s comment highlights a growing concern about the future of work as AI technologies become more advanced. Many experts predict widespread automation could replace jobs in sectors like manufacturing, customer service, and data entry.Although Musk did not list specific roles, it is likely that jobs involving storytelling, art, caregiving, teaching, and other deeply human experiences may retain their importance. Industries such as entertainment, therapy, education, and hospitality could be among those where people remain central.In another news, Musk has once again raised alarms about plummeting global fertility rates, asserting that a 2.7 children per woman average is needed for population stability, higher than previously thought. In a recent post on X, the Tesla CEO responded to claims that women need an average of 2.7 children per woman to maintain population stability, significantly higher than the previously accepted 2.1 replacement rate.""People who have kids do need to have 3 kids to make up for those who have 0 or 1 kid or population will collapse,"" Musk wrote, sharing his mathematical calculation for maintaining global population levels.The entrepreneur's latest comments came in response to alarming fertility statistics showing the United States currently at 1.66 children per woman, while countries like Italy and Japan lag even further behind at 1.29 and 1.30 respectively. These figures fall well short of the newly proposed 2.7 threshold, which factors in variables like childlessness rates and gender distribution.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes that while artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform many industries, some jobs may remain uniquely human.

Microsoft’s next-gen AI chip may be facing production delay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-next-gen-ai-chip-may-be-facing-production-delay/articleshow/122116268.cms,"The race for custom AI processors hots up



Microsoft ’s plans for its next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) chip, code-named Maia, are reportedly facing a significant setback. According to The Information, citing sources involved in the effort, the chip's mass production has been delayed by at least six months, now pushing its rollout into 2026 instead of the anticipated 2025.When “Braga,” as the chip is also known, eventually enters production, its performance is expected to fall considerably short of Nvidia's Blackwell chip, which was released late last year, the report said.Microsoft had initially aimed to integrate the Maia chip into its data centers as early as this year. However, design changes, staffing constraints and high employee turnover are cited as key factors contributing to the delay.Like its major tech counterparts, Microsoft has been heavily investing in developing custom processors for AI operations and general-purpose applications. This move is intended to lessen the tech giant's dependence on expensive chips from Nvidia, which currently dominates the AI hardware market .Cloud rivals Amazon and Alphabet’s Google have also been pursuing in-house chip development, tailoring processors to their specific needs with the dual goals of boosting performance and cutting costs.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Brad Pitt targeted during global movie tour, joins list of burglarized public figures

Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce may offer Brad Pitt security insights amid rising celebrity break-ins

In a growing trend that’s raising alarms across the entertainment and sports worlds, Brad Pitt has become the latest celebrity victim of a high-stakes home burglary. The break-in at his $5.5 million Los Feliz mansion took place while he was overseas promoting his highly anticipated Formula 1 film, a project he co-produced with Lewis Hamilton. The timing is especially concerning, mirroring similar incidents involving NFL stars Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow, who were targeted while away on public commitments.Authorities believe Brad Pitt’s public schedule may have been exploited by organized criminals tracking his high-profile appearances during the F1 film's London premiere. As the movie gains international attention for its real-race footage and collaboration with Formula 1 insiders, Pitt's personal security has been compromised. “It’s another example of how public schedules can be weaponized,” a security expert noted, reflecting on the growing risks tied to celebrity visibility.Pitt’s home invasion follows a string of similar incidents targeting athletes and A-list celebrities. NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes had his home intruded upon earlier this year, and Travis Kelce , fresh off a Super Bowl win and in the global spotlight thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift, has also faced multiple privacy breaches.Given their shared experiences, Mahomes and Kelce could serve as valuable resources for Pitt. The Chiefs tight end has publicly discussed beefing up his home security with private teams and smart surveillance systems, particularly since dating Swift. Kelce’s proactive steps may now become a model for others navigating fame and personal vulnerability.Mahomes, known for his team-oriented approach both on and off the field, has reportedly leaned on advanced technology and expert consultations after his own home was targeted. His experience dealing with such a violation might provide Pitt—and other celebrities—practical steps for reclaiming safety and peace of mind.The troubling frequency of these invasions suggests this isn’t a random spree—it’s a pattern. With celebrities being tracked during press tours, filming schedules, and public appearances, the need for a stronger, more collaborative security framework has never been more urgent. As Pitt increases surveillance around his property and authorities review footage and witness reports, other stars may need to follow suit.Also Read: Tom Brady’s rumored fling with Sydney Sweeney leaves raises eyebrows: A scandalous rebound from Gisele Bündchen?

Taysom Hill could be the missing piece in Sean Payton’s 2025 offense

Denver Broncos Potentially Reuniting Taysom Hill With Sean Payton Is Risky

The Denver Broncos may finally have a shot at reuniting Sean Payton with Taysom Hill. The versatile playmaker, long connected to Denver, could become available if the New Orleans Saints cut him this offseason. With the Broncos in need of offensive weapons, Hill’s unique skill set could make him the perfect fit for Payton’s 2025 game plan.The Denver Broncos have long been linked to Taysom Hill, the do-it-all weapon who rose to prominence under Sean Payton with the New Orleans Saints. Though Hill has stayed in New Orleans until now, multiple reports suggest he may be on the chopping block this offseason.Bleacher Report’s Alex Kay believes that if Hill is cut, every NFL team should be interested. The Saints would save $10 million in cap space, and Hill’s reduced role makes his release a realistic possibility.David Latham of Last Word on Sports believes a Payton-Hill reunion would benefit both parties.“Nobody loves Taysom Hill more than Sean Payton, so it only makes sense these two reunite away from the Saints,” Latham noted. “Payton brought the Broncos to the playoffs despite starting rookie Bo Nix and having limited weapons outside of Courtland Sutton.Free-agent tight end Evan Engram will lead the passing game, but the team could use someone like Hill to be the TE2 and add an extra dimension as a trick play threat. ""Hill’s true value lies in his versatility—tight end, quarterback, runner, special teams contributor. He excels in short-yardage and red-zone scenarios, with the ability to throw, run, or block depending on the situation. His unpredictability creates constant headaches for opposing defenses.Hill’s best years came with Drew Brees under center, when Payton regularly inserted him into high-impact moments. That formula could be recreated with Bo Nix, giving Denver a proven red-zone and trick-play weapon.Also Read: Steelers acquire DK Metcalf in major NFL trade—Here’s why $132M deal makes sense If the Saints move on, the Broncos should act fast.

Why DK Metcalf’s contract could be a long-term steal for Pittsburgh

Steelers Sights & Sounds: Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf Make Steelers Practice Debuts

The Pittsburgh Steelers shocked the NFL by acquiring wide receiver DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a 2025 second-round pick. Shortly after the trade, the Steelers handed Metcalf a massive four-year, $132 million extension. While some critics call it an overpay, the deal's structure may prove to be a win for Pittsburgh.The Steelers didn’t just trade for a superstar, they bought flexibility, leverage, and long-term control. While DK Metcalf’s $132 million extension with $60 million guaranteed makes him the fourth-highest-paid wide receiver in the league, there’s more to the deal than meets the eye.ESPN’s Dan Graziano believes the structure of Metcalf’s contract makes it surprisingly team-friendly. After 2026, none of his salary is guaranteed, giving the Steelers an escape hatch. According to Over the Cap, Pittsburgh could release him after June 1, 2027, and free up $26.5 million in cap space. That means the team gets Metcalf’s prime years without committing to his decline.With the wide receiver market exploding, it’s also a forward-thinking move. While Metcalf ranks fourth in average annual value now, there’s a high likelihood he drops outside the top five by next season.His contract might seem expensive today but could look like a bargain in just 12 months.Beyond the dollars, the football impact is undeniable. Metcalf, still just 27, brings elite size, speed, and red-zone dominance. He gives Pittsburgh a legitimate WR1—something the team hasn’t had since the peak of Antonio Brown. The addition boosts a Steelers offense looking to contend immediately.Pittsburgh pulled off the trade by parting with just a second-round pick.

His ability to guard multiple positions and score efficiently makes him an ideal complement to Giannis.Milwaukee has consistently made bold moves to appease Antetokounmpo:As Ivan White noted in the original report, ""Each time it seems as if the Bucks might have to face a trade request from their star, they have made a big move.""Wiggins could be the latest attempt to keep Giannis in Milwaukee long-term.With Andrew Wiggins’ future in Miami uncertain after the Jimmy Butler trade, the Bucks could capitalize. His contract and skill set make him a low-risk, high-reward target. If the deal materializes, Milwaukee’s lineup would gain much-needed depth and experience for another title push.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Phoenix Suns' $251,019,650 superstar predicted to land in Atlanta Hawks to form deadly duo with Trae Young The Milwaukee Bucks’ pursuit of Andrew Wiggins signals their urgency to build a contender around Giannis Antetokounmpo.
