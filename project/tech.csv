Safety enhancements include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system. Like the existing chair car variant, the sleeper version will also use regenerative braking to improve energy efficiency.

Coaches will have fully sealed gangways and automated inter-coach doors, helping maintain consistent air quality and stable cabin temperatures.

Each coach will be fitted with personal reading lights, power charging points, foldable snack tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will operate automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System is in place, along with emergency communication features that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive pilot when required.

Vande Bharat sleeper train to be launched soon! In a big New year cheer for Indian Railways passengers, railway minister Ashwini Vaishaw has announced that the first Vande Bharat sleeper train will be launched this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to flag off the Vande Bharat sleeper train in the second half of January 2026.Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned train set that has been manufactured by Indian Railways for long-distance routes and overnight journeys. According to Ashwini Vaishnaw , two Vande Bharat sleeper train sets are ready and have undergone successful trial runs. The new trains will be operated on 1,200-1,500 kmph routes of the national transporter.The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata, Ashwini Vaishnaw announced on Thursday. Each Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 coaches. The composition of the coaches is: 11 AC 3-tier, 4 AC 2-tier, and one AC 1st coach. The train can accommodate 823 passengers. Vaishnaw said that eight more Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out in the next six months, and the total will go up to 12 by year-end.The new train is scheduled to run between Howrah and Guwahati (Kamakhya). According to Indian Railways, the following districts will be benefitted:Ashwini Vaishnaw recently shared a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showcasing the train undergoing high-speed trials on the Indian Railways network.During test runs conducted on the Kota–Nagda route, the Vande Bharat sleeper train achieved its top design speed of 180 kmph. A notable highlight from the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained perfectly balanced without any water spilling even at over 180 kmph speed.“Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner ailway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote in his post on X.Designed for overnight and long-haul journeys, the Vande Bharat sleeper train is the sleeping-class counterpart of the Vande Bharat chair car services already operating across the country.At present, two prototype rakes of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have been produced by BEML. Indian Railways is also gearing up for a broader transformation of long-distance travel, with plans to roll out more than 200 such sleeper trains in the coming years, supported by several ongoing manufacturing initiatives.BEML is jointly producing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets in partnership with the Integral Coach Factory. Another batch of 10 sleeper rakes is being built by Kinet, a joint venture involving Indian and Russian entities. In addition, a consortium led by Titagarh Rail Systems along with BHEL has secured an order to manufacture 80 sleeper-class trainsets. Separately, the Integral Coach Factory is also developing its own sleeper configuration of the Vande Bharat train as an internal project.",Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned train set that has been manufactured by Indian Railways for long-distance routes and overnight journeys.

"In a 1st in world, Army set to deploy ramjet-powered shells for 155mm artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-world-army-set-to-deploy-ramjet-powered-shells-for-155mm-artillery-guns/articleshow/126330397.cms,"From Missiles To Torpedoes, DRDO Outlines India’s Big Defence Push For Near-Term Battlefield Edge

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

Matthew Mercer steps back from Critical Role livestream as the creator reflects on burnout and long-term creative health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/matthew-mercer-steps-back-from-critical-role-livestream-as-the-creator-reflects-on-burnout-and-long-term-creative-health/articleshow/126323162.cms,"Matthew Mercer (via Getty Images)

A new campaign leader emerges as Mercer redefines his role behind the scenes

The Real Matt Mercer (feat. Matt Mercer)





Popular gaming voice actor Matthew Mercer has long been the face and guiding voice behind Critical Role’s iconic “Dungeons and Dragons” livestream. However, his decision to step away from overseeing the flagship livestream shocked many fans. For more than a decade, his creative brand of storytelling as the Dungeon Master helped turn a group of voice actors into one of the most influential brands in modern nerd culture.Mercer opened up further about his decision during an August appearance on the podcast “Crispy’s Tavern: Tales and Tea.” He described the move as something that he needed to do after years of constant creative output, leadership, and visibility. He acknowledged that the pace had begun to affect his well-being, and the need to continuously churn out content was physically draining. He believes stepping away will give him time to focus on other creative endeavours.He also emphasized the importance of stepping away when one experiences creative burnout, telling Business Insider, “My biggest advice for burnout is to acknowledge when you’re at the edge and take every opportunity you can to step away and replenish your cup.”However, he remains deeply involved alongside his seven co-founders as the Critical Role Productions’ Chief Creative Officer.The company continued to expand its presence through two animated series backed by Amazon. He also plays a key role at Darrington Press, the studio’s game publishing arm, which launched “Daggerheart,” a tabletop game designed as a fresh alternative to traditional “Dungeons and Dragons.Mercer believes that stepping away will only increase his creativity and make time for other things he wants to do. He said, “Walking away and taking some time to enrich your creative input means that whatever time you lost beating your head against the wall will be more than made up for when you return from a place of genuine inspiration and renewal.”To guide the livestream forward, Brennan Lee Mulligan has taken over as game master for Campaign Four. Known for his work on “Dimension 20” and his long-standing creative partnership with Mercer, Mulligan brings a different energy while maintaining the collaborative spirit fans expect. Campaign Four continues to stream on Beacon, as well as Twitch and YouTube. Most recently, Mercer voiced the character Shroud, who served as the main supervillain of the acclaimed video game Dispatch.Also read: Top 10 Twitch streamers by hours watched and Kai Cenat leads the way",Matthew Mercer has stepped away from overseeing the flagship livestream of Critical Role’s “Dungeons and Dragons” He believes stepping away will give him time to focus on other creative endeavours.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon. We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform. In September this year, Arattai (meaning chat in Tamil) topped App Store ranking, registering 3,50,000 signs in just three days.Arattai offers familiar features such as:However, the app is still ironing out issues.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether.

Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Elon Musk's Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot.

""I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,"" he said.

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end.

Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said.

Official safety guidelines

Motorists: Avoid sudden braking on dusty roads and maintain a significant distance from the vehicle in front.

Homeowners: Secure loose outdoor furniture, umbrellas, and light structures that could be swept away by 60km/h gusts.

Farmers: Take immediate precautions to protect frost-sensitive crops in northern and western desert regions.

Emergency Contact: For any weather-related emergencies, residents are urged to contact the hotline at 112.





Meteorology departments across the Gulf have issued a weather alert for strong winds and significantly reduced visibility, particularly in Kuwait , with impacts likely felt in coastal and inland areas today. Officials warn that northwesterly winds exceeding 60 km/h will sweep through parts of the region, bringing dust, blowing sand, and horizontal visibility dropping below 1,000 meters in exposed spots.Kuwait is bracing for a day of turbulent weather as the Meteorological Department issues a stern warning for Monday, January 5, 2026. A powerful northwesterly wind system is set to dominate the skyline, with speeds expected to roar past 60 km/h. This isn’t just a breeze; the sheer force of the wind is predicted to kick up significant dust and sand across the country, turning the blue skies into a hazy brown.For those heading out, the impact will be immediate. Horizontal visibility is expected to plummet to less than 1,000 meters in several regions. In open desert areas and along highways, experts warn that visibility could occasionally hit zero due to sand drifting.If you are commuting between cities, expect a ""whiteout"" effect, only this time, it’s made of desert sand.Alongside strong winds, Kuwait’s Meteorological Department has also issued a cold weather warning, cautioning that minimum temperatures are expected to drop below 3°C, raising the risk of frost formation in agricultural and desert areas. The frost alert is in effect from 1:30am to 8:30am on Monday, January 5, with authorities urging farmers and residents in open areas to take precautionary measures to protect crops, livestock and outdoor equipment. The warning was issued shortly after 1:00am, highlighting a sharp overnight temperature drop.The chaos isn't limited to the land. Mariners and beachgoers are being told to stay clear of the water as the ""freshening"" northwesterly winds wreak havoc on sea conditions. The Meteorological Department has confirmed that waves in the Arabian Gulf could surge to heights of 6 to 7 feet.This ""rough to very rough"" sea state poses a significant risk to small boats and fishing vessels. Authorities have officially advised against all marine activities until the wind activity subsides. The warning is currently slated to remain in peak effect from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM, though choppy conditions may persist well into the evening.As the dust begins to settle, a different kind of weather threat is creeping in: a biting cold snap. Following the wind shift, temperatures are expected to take a dramatic dive. Forecasters have issued a rare frost warning for agricultural and desert areas, with minimum temperatures potentially dipping below 3°C.This sudden drop in mercury follows a period of relatively mild weather, making the change feel even more severe. The Ministry of Health has urged residents, especially those with respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, to stay indoors to avoid the dual threat of fine dust particles and the freezing air. For those who must go out, wearing N95 masks is highly recommended to filter out the PM2.5 pollutants carried by the wind.The Ministry of Interior (MoI) and the Meteorological Department have activated emergency protocols to manage the fallout from the shifting pressure systems. Acting Director of the Meteorology Department, Dhirar Al-Ali, stated that the country is currently under the influence of a ""deep surface low-pressure system,"" which is driving the atmospheric instability.To stay safe, authorities recommend the following:Similar conditions have appeared in recent months across the Gulf. Strong winds and blowing dust have prompted earlier warnings of reduced visibility and hazardous seas in Kuwait and neighbouring Gulf states, as noted by meteorology departments in routine forecasts.This kind of northwesterly wind pattern is common during transitional weather periods and can stir up dust storms, further robbing the air of clarity and increasing the risk of travel delays.","Strong winds, dust storms, and a sharp temperature drop are sweeping across Kuwait.

Burj Khalifa as a vision of height and how it grew taller



Burj Khalifa’s breakthrough: Buttressed core system



Burj Khalifa’s engineering against the elements: Wind, heat, sand



Burj Khalifa’s safety, sustainability and built in innovation



Burj Khalifa: A legacy that is larger than its height







When the Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010, it did not just take the title of the world’s tallest building, it announced Dubai to the world as a hub of ambition, innovation and architectural daring. More than a decade later, architects and engineers still marvel at how it was done and how the structure continues to stand as a benchmark of engineering excellence. At the centre of that success is Bill Baker, the structural engineer whose pioneering designs made the 828-metre landmark possible.Read on as we explore the groundbreaking systems and safety features that not only helped build Burj Khalifa but keep it safe, stable and relevant in 2026, by design as much as by physics.Did you know that the original concept for the Burj Khalifa was not always as tall as it is today? The building began life planned for about 518 metres but as engineers tested and refined the design, they realised it was possible to go much higher while keeping stability and cost efficiency in check. Through iterative wind-tunnel experiments and modelling, the team increased the design by another 310 metres, roughly the height of the Eiffel Tower, without compromising safety or performance.This refinement was not just ambition, it was engineering evolution. From the outset, the project’s core team, led by Emaar Properties and coordinated with global experts, approached the build with flexibility and scientific rigour. The result is not just a taller building but a smarter one.At the heart of Burj Khalifa’s structural resilience is an innovative design known as the “buttressed core”, a concept developed by Baker and his colleagues at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). This system uses a central reinforced core shaped like an irregular hexagon, with three wings extending outward in a Y-shaped plan.For its torsional stability, the hexagonal core acts much like an axle, resisting twists and turns that wind forces cause at great heights. For wind resistance, each wing buttresses the others, distributing load evenly and making the structure incredibly stable even in strong gusts. Burj Khalifa's aerodynamic efficiency is credited to the unusual shape that helps “confuse the wind”, so vortices don’t form consistently around the surface, dramatically reducing oscillation forces.This structural system made it possible for Burj Khalifa to break previous height records by a huge margin, not incrementally but dramatically. It is a standard-setter that has since influenced other super-tall buildings around the world.Dubai’s environmental conditions presented unique challenges. With summer temperatures often exceeding 50 °C and desert winds exerting unpredictable force, the design team needed solutions on multiple fronts. For the wind tunnel testing, the team conducted over 40 wind tunnel analyses to model how the building would respond to every possible force, adjusting setbacks and facade angles accordingly.For concrete and cladding, special cladding panels (about 26,000 of them) were hand-cut to fit perfectly and minimise thermal and light stress. Ultra-reflective materials protect the structure from heat gain. For its foundations, instead of sitting directly on loose sand, Burj Khalifa rises from a reinforced concrete mat supported by deep bored piles, anchoring the entire 828-metre tower on solid ground.Beyond these classical engineering feats, modern protective technologies like cathodic corrosion protection help guard steel reinforcement in the foundation from salt-rich groundwater, ensuring a long lifespan for the structure at its base.The Burj Khalifa was designed long before “sustainability” became a global buzzword, yet some of its features anticipated today’s priorities. Its efficient skin design is such that because of its Y-plan, only one-sixth of the building’s surface is exposed to direct sunlight at any time, which reduces solar heat gain and improves cooling efficiency.For fresh water harvesting, instead of letting condensate from air-conditioning systems drain away, the building’s design captures the equivalent of 20 Olympic-size pools of water each year, which is a hidden but smart reuse strategy. For climate-responsive comforts, higher floors benefit from cooler temperatures and clearer air, making upper-level conditions surprisingly pleasant despite the desert environment.From energy efficiency to water management, Burj Khalifa’s design anticipated elements of today’s sustainability standards long before they were industry norms.Fifteen years after opening, the Burj Khalifa stands not just as an architectural icon but as a symbol of what coordinated vision and structural innovation can achieve. Bill Baker himself described the tower as a statement of optimism and ambition, which was part engineering marvel and part cultural milestone that inspires millions of visitors every year.The “Burj Effect” goes beyond tourism as properties with views of the skyscraper command premium prices and the building’s presence reshaped Dubai’s skyline and global image. For Baker and the original design team, the real reward is not just in the height record or technical achievements, it is in seeing how the building continues to stand tall, safe and relevant more than a decade after its completion.Looking ahead, experts say that Burj Khalifa’s core concepts will continue to influence future tall-building design, even as materials and technologies evolve. Baker has hinted that even taller structures, potentially breaching the kilometre mark, are possible, though they would likely require new structural systems and solutions for challenges like vertical transportation and pressure changes at extreme heights.In the meantime, Burj Khalifa remains a testament to the blend of human ambition, scientific rigour and architectural artistry. It is a building that did not just redefine Dubai but reshaped what the world believes is possible in vertical architecture.","The Burj Khalifa opened on January 4, 2010.

How to avoid penalties and stay compliant



Avoid excessive revving or loud acceleration in residential areas. Police specifically target such behaviour as disruptive.

Do not fit unauthorised modifications to engines or exhaust systems without proper approval and documentation.

Be mindful of noise levels at family campsites and sandy outskirts, where enforcement has been active.

Report genuinely disruptive vehicles through official channels to help authorities maintain peace in your neighbourhood.

Broader trend: UAE tightens traffic enforcement







Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles, issuing stern warnings and sharp penalties that are now top of mind for motorists across the emirate. As authorities push for safer, quieter streets, drivers are being reminded that excessively loud vehicles that are often the result of unauthorised modifications or reckless behaviour, can carry a hefty Dh2,000 fine and 12 black traffic points, along with other legal consequences under UAE law.The Abu Dhabi Police have publicly stressed that loud, roaring engines and other forms of disruptive driving are not just annoyances, they are public safety concerns. Noise from vehicles can disrupt residents, particularly in family neighbourhoods and sandy outskirts, causing distress to children, the elderly and individuals with medical sensitivities.This enforcement effort comes as part of a broader push to curb reckless driving, curb noise pollution and promote courteous behaviour on the roads. Officers have specifically targeted drivers, often younger motorists, operating vehicles with modified exhausts, unleashed engines or ritually revving machines in residential districts, family campsites and sandy zones near homes.Under Article 20 of the Traffic and Circulation Law, motorists who operate vehicles that cause excessive noise face a Dh2,000 fine and a deduction of 12 black points from their driving licence if found violating the law. These penalties can significantly impact a driver’s record and insurance eligibility over time.In addition to fines for noise, police are also cracking down on unauthorised modifications to engines or chassis, another major contributor to sound pollution. Drivers who make such modifications without approval may face a Dh1,000 fine, 12 traffic points and possible impoundment of their vehicle for up to 30 days under Law No. 5 of 2020. Vehicles impounded for illegal modifications can only be released after paying a Dh10,000 release fee, and if left unclaimed for three months, they may be auctioned off.Authorities have backed up these warnings with action. In a coordinated enforcement operation in Al Ain in early 2025, police seized 106 vehicles found to have excessive modifications that caused loud noise disturbances, highlighting that enforcement isn’t limited to warnings alone but includes real consequences for violators.Officials frame this crackdown as about more than just reducing noise. It is part of enhancing road safety, community wellbeing and traffic order. Loud vehicles and reckless driving habits can distract other road users, potentially increasing the risk of accidents. Noise pollution is also broadly seen as an “uncivilised behaviour” that tarnishes the image of neighbourhoods and disrupts day-to-day life.Abu Dhabi Police have actively encouraged members of the public to report noisy or disruptive vehicles by calling the emergency number (999). This community-assisted approach emphasizes that residents have a role to play in shaping safer, quieter streets.Loud cars and vehicle modifications have become increasingly popular among certain driving enthusiast groups in the UAE, especially those who enjoy customised engines and aftermarket upgrades. However, police have repeatedly reminded motorists that unauthorised enhancements that amplify noise or alter performance are against the law and subject to penalties.Online discussions from local drivers reflect mixed feelings about the enforcement. Some argue that normal engine sounds from stock vehicles should not count as violations, while others emphasize responsible driving behaviour, particularly in residential zones where noise can cause anxiety and stress.RedditIf you drive in Abu Dhabi or plan to visit from another emirate, here’s how to ensure you avoid a hefty fine and black points on your licence:Ultimately, the new enforcement marks a shift towards prioritising everyone’s right to a safe, peaceful environment. Whether you live in a bustling neighbourhood or pass through Abu Dhabi’s streets on the way to work or leisure, these rules remind drivers that personal enjoyment should never come at the expense of public safety and community harmony.As 2026 unfolds, road users in Abu Dhabi, from enthusiastic petrolheads to daily commuters, will be keen to adapt to these measures, ensuring that the emirate’s streets are not just free-flowing but also free from unnecessary noise and disruption.Abu Dhabi’s increasingly stringent approach is part of a wider UAE trend of enhancing road rules and penalties for a variety of traffic violations, from dangerous manoeuvres to excessive vehicle noise. Across the country, authorities actively use technology and patrols to enforce regulations and educate drivers on safety best practices","Abu Dhabi is doubling down on road safety and community peace with an intensified campaign against noisy driving and disruptive vehicles.

Dubai bans beloved BBQ tradition at Jebel Hafeet: Is this overreach?



Barbecue Tradition Meets a Hard Stop at Jebel Hafeet in Dubai: Here’s What’s Changed





Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise. Barbecues are now banned in several parking areas at Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain, one of the UAE’s most beloved mountain getaways. Visitors caught lighting up grills in prohibited spots can face fines that escalate with repeated violations, up to Dh4,000 on the third offence, as authorities clamp down on littering and misuse of the scenic site.Jebel Hafeet, with its dramatic mountain road, sprawling views and family-friendly Green Mubazzarah Park, attracts hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists each year, especially during the cooler months. However, growing concern over environmental impact and mounting waste left behind by visitors has led the Department of Municipalities and Transport and Al Ain City Municipality to take action. Multiple warning signs placed across several parking lots and popular picnic spots now clearly spell out that “barbecue/BBQ is strictly prohibited in this area. ”The penalty framework comes from Law No. 2 of 2012 concerning the Preservation of Public Appearance, Health and Tranquility in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which imposes a Dh1,000 fine for first-time non-compliance, Dh2,000 for repeated violations and Dh4,000 for subsequent offences, giving authorities a stronger tool to protect the area’s natural beauty and visitor experience.For generations, gatherings around BBQs at scenic venues like Jebel Hafeet have been a weekend staple for UAE families and friends, with visitors often packing food and grills to enjoy the cool mountain air. However, the new restrictions echo past efforts in the region to preserve sensitive outdoor sites as similar rules have been enforced at deserts and parks where litter and irresponsible fire use posed environmental and safety risks.Local social media discussions reflect mixed reactions. Some people lament the loss of a beloved tradition, while others point to the environmental cost of charcoal waste and litter left behind after picnics, noting that stricter enforcement may be necessary to safeguard delicate mountain ecosystems and keep the area inviting for future visitors.While barbecuing on Jebel Hafeet’s parking lots and roadside spots is now off-limits, authorities consistently remind residents and tourists that designated areas in public parks across Abu Dhabi, including Al Sulaimi and Al Mebrazah parks, still permit BBQ gatherings in a responsible and regulated way.In short, if you are planning a scenic winter outing to Jebel Hafeet this season, portable or personal grills need to be left at home or limited to official BBQ zones. The ban aims to balance enjoyment of the mountain’s natural charm with preserving the environment and ensuring that everyone can continue to enjoy the stunning landscape for many years to come.","Dubai-area officials have introduced a new rule that is catching weekend warriors and outdoor lovers by surprise.

Wider implications for families









From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier. The change aligns with the updated 12.45pm Friday prayer time and gives families more time for religious observance, reflecting a nationwide effort to balance academic schedules with cultural and spiritual commitments.Kindergarten classes will run from 8am until 11.30am. For Cycle 1 students, covering grades 1 to 4, schools will use staggered schedules to manage classroom and transport logistics:These changes are designed to allow parents enough time to pick up their children and attend Friday prayers without rushing, while still completing the required curriculum hours.For students in Cycles 2 and 3, which include grades 6 to 12, the Ministry has announced separate timings for boys and girls:In addition, schools may offer online learning for students in Grade 6 and above on Fridays. Such arrangements require consultation with parents and approval from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). This measure is intended to provide flexibility while maintaining academic continuity.Dubai’s KHDA confirmed that all private schools and early childhood centres within private schools will end lessons by 11.30am on Fridays starting January 9. Many schools have already begun sending circulars to parents, informing them of the revised hours.The adjustment follows the nationwide shift of Friday prayer times to 12.45pm, as confirmed by the General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Awqaf and Zakat. KHDA emphasized that schools have the flexibility to implement staggered or phased dismissal arrangements to meet operational and academic needs while minimizing disruption to teaching and learning.While the change is mainly aligned with religious timings, parents note that it also affects daily routines beyond the classroom. Earlier dismissal impacts traffic flow, workplace arrangements, and childcare schedules. Families particularly feel the pressure in the short window between school pick-up and Friday prayers, highlighting the practical ripple effects of the new timing.KHDA officially described the move as a careful balance between student's overall well-being and curriculum requirements, ensuring that learning continues effectively while also giving families the opportunity to participate in Friday prayers.","From January 9, schools across the UAE will shorten Fridays, allowing students from kindergarten to grade 12 to leave earlier.

Today's UAE weather alert

Kyiv On Edge After Putin’s Kherson Revenge Warning; Ukraine Army 'Sounds Alert'

Today’s weather will be fair to partly cloudy, with humid nights and mornings increasing fog potential.

Winds are expected to be light to moderate, becoming fresh to strong over the sea, potentially lifting dust.

Sea conditions will vary from moderate to rough in the Arabian Gulf and slight in the Oman Sea.

Sunday, January 4 is expected to be dusty and partly cloudy with stronger northwesterly winds (up to ~50 km/h) and reduced visibility due to blowing sand and dust.

Monday and Tuesday may again see fog and mist formation at night and early morning in western internal areas.

Impact on travel

Expect horizontal visibility to drop sharply, sometimes close to zero.

Drive slower, maintain safe distances, and be prepared for sudden low-visibility pockets.

Watch for changing winds that can introduce blowing dust, especially near highways and open deserts.





If you are planning an early start this Saturday, January 3, 2026, you might want to double-check your windows first. This atmospheric ""whiteout"" isn't just a scenic morning view; it is a serious safety concern.The NCM warns that the combination of high humidity and specific pressure systems is creating the perfect recipe for dense mist. Whether you are in the heart of Dubai or commuting through the Abu Dhabi desert, the message from authorities is clear: stay alert and expect the unexpected.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather advisory for dense fog and significantly reduced visibility in parts of Dubai and some internal and coastal areas of the UAE between midnight and 10 am on January 3, 2026. Drivers and residents should brace for potentially near-zero visibility, especially during early morning travel.=Humidity levels are forecast to rise overnight, creating ideal conditions for fog and mist formation across several regions. The NCM’s alert stresses that these conditions may make driving difficult and hazardous, particularly on highways and open roads at first light.According to the NCM forecast:Looking ahead:These conditions follow past patterns where fog, mist, and dust events frequently recur in the UAE, leading to both safety alerts and traffic adjustments.Authorities are advising motorists to exercise extreme caution:Similar fog alerts have frequently prompted red and yellow warnings in previous fog events, with local police reminding drivers to follow posted speed limits and avoid distractions while navigating foggy roads.While the fog is expected to burn off by mid-morning on Saturday, the weather ""drama"" isn't over. The NCM’s five-day bulletin indicates that the UAE is entering a transition period. As the fog clears, a shift in air pressure will bring stronger northwesterly winds, reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h by Sunday.This means the ""white"" fog will likely be replaced by ""yellow"" dust clouds, further affecting visibility throughout the remainder of the weekend. Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf are also predicted to turn rough to very rough, so mariners and beachgoers should exercise extreme caution.","The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued a weather advisory for dense fog and significantly reduced visibility in parts of Dubai and some internal and coastal areas of the UAE between midnight and 10 am on January 3, 2026.

The Great Indian Kapil Show,





Indian comedy superstar Kapil Sharma is not just making audiences laugh on screen, he’s now serving up comfort food and café vibes in the Middle East. On December 31, 2025, the comedian and television personality opened Kap’s Cafe in Dubai, marking the hospitality brand’s first foray into the Middle East after earlier launching its first international location in Surrey, Canada.Kap’s Cafe Dubai is not your typical coffee spot. The interior design leans into pastel-heavy hues, muted greens and soft pinks with plush seating and statement lighting, creating a space that is both Instagram-friendly and comfortably familiar. The décor is inspired by the visual language ofthe Netflix hit hosted by Sharma that has become one of India’s most watched comedy series globally, giving fans a sense of walking into the show’s world itself.In social media clips shared by the comedian, Sharma appears smiling, greeting visitors and even serving coffee, much like a host welcoming guests into his home, fitting the café’s relaxed and “comfort first” ethos.While the full Dubai menu has not been officially launched yet, early previews suggest a selection rooted in comfort-driven café classics. Fans can likely expect a mix of Indian and Western favourites, similar to the offerings at the Canada location, including:The inclusion of jaggery-infused lime juice, in particular, gives the café a signature drink that speaks to Sharma’s roots and personal taste, making the experience feel less like a corporate chain and more like a beloved local hangout with celebrity charm.The Dubai café opened its doors from 4 pm to midnight on New Year’s Eve, positioning itself as a cosy alternative to the city’s louder nightlife and a welcoming space for Delhi-to-Dubai travellers, fans of the Netflix series and coffee lovers alike. Located in the Al Kifaf area, Kap’s Cafe joins a growing list of celebrity-linked hospitality ventures in the UAE, a market known for its diverse food scene and appetite for global flavours.Kap’s Cafe’s expansion comes amid a backdrop of challenges for the brand. Last year, the Canada location in Surrey made headlines after facing multiple shooting incidents, including three attacks over several months in 2025. Despite these setbacks, the Dubai launch demonstrates Sharma’s resilience and confidence in growing his hospitality venture internationally.The Dubai opening does not just reflect a culinary expansion, it illustrates how celebrities are blending entertainment, personal branding and lifestyle experiences. By drawing inspiration froma Netflix series that has gained traction and viewership across borders, Kap’s Cafe lets fans step into the world of their favourite comedian, turning casual dining into a form of pop-culture engagement.In a city famed for megaprojects and world-class dining, Kap’s Cafe stands out by offering a comfortable, personality-driven space that promises laughter, nostalgia and heartwarming food, all wrapped in the vibe of one of India’s most iconic comedy voices.","Kapil Sharma opened Kap's Cafe in Dubai on December 31, 2025.

"UAE Bank to end SMS OTPs for online transactions from Jan 6, switch to biometric authentication",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-bank-to-end-sms-otps-for-online-transactions-from-jan-6-switch-to-biometric-authentication/articleshow/126303573.cms,"UAE’s big banking change for online card transactions / AI Generated Image

Why are UAE banks ending SMS OTPs?

SIM-Swapping: Criminals trick mobile providers into porting your number to their SIM card, effectively ""stealing"" your identity and receiving your OTPs directly.

Phishing Scams: Fraudsters create fake websites that look exactly like your bank or a delivery service, tricking you into typing your OTP into their hands.

Interception: Advanced hackers can sometimes intercept SMS messages as they travel through the air using outdated ""SS7"" protocols.

What are in-app approvals?



The Trigger: You click ""Pay"" on a shopping website or app.

The Notification: Instead of an SMS, you’ll receive a push notification directly from your bank’s official mobile app.

The Review: When you tap the notification, the app opens to show you the exact merchant name and the amount being charged—no more ""blindly"" entering codes.

The Approval: You confirm the transaction using biometric verification (Face ID or fingerprint) or your secure Smart Pass PIN.

What does the resident need to do now?

Update your bank’s mobile app to the latest version.

Enable push notifications and biometric login in the app settings.

Log in to your account and complete any authentication setup before January 6.

Why should you act now?





If you’ve lived in the UAE for a while, the ""ping"" of an incoming SMS with a six-digit code has been the soundtrack to your online shopping. But that sound is about to become a relic of the past. Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords (OTPs) via text message for online card payments.This isn't just a minor update; it’s a full-scale security revolution mandated by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE). For years, SMS codes were the gold standard for two-factor authentication, but as hackers became more sophisticated, the ""weak links"" in the SMS system became too big to ignore.By shifting to a mobile-first approach, the UAE is positioning itself as a global leader in protecting its residents' hard-earned money.The primary reason for this change is simple: Security. While SMS is convenient, it travels over open telecommunications networks that were never designed for high-stakes banking.This made them prime targets for three specific types of fraud:According to industry reports, SMS-related fraud caused billions in global losses.In the UAE alone, scams saw a significant jump in recent years, prompting the Central Bank to issue Notice 2025/3057, which effectively bans SMS and email OTPs as a standalone security method.The future of banking in the UAE is ""In-App Authentication."" Instead of waiting for a text and manually typing in a code, the process is now much faster and more integrated. Here is what your next online purchase will look like:This ""closed-loop"" system ensures that the person approving the transaction is physically holding the trusted device. It removes the need for the telephone network entirely, which is also a massive win for travelers who often struggle to receive SMS codes while roaming.This isn’t just a technical update, it affects every resident who shops online or uses digital banking in the UAE.How to prepare:Once SMS OTPs are phased out, you won’t be able to approve online card purchases using text codes. Transactions will be declined unless verified through the bank app. This change also means that iPhone or Android users must ensure their device settings allow notifications from their bank app.If you haven’t already switched to app-based authentication, banks generally recommend doing so well before the deadline to avoid disruptions.This step is part of a larger plan led by the Central Bank of the UAE to strengthen digital banking infrastructure. Regulators have mandated that banks phase out SMS and email OTPs by March 2026 at the latest, although many instituted the change early.The goal is to reduce fraud and align with global best practices, as digital fraud patterns evolve. By moving to in-app authentication with biometric verification and encrypted channels, banks aim to create a more secure, convenient and unified payment experience for customers.","Starting January 6, 2026, several major UAE banks will officially stop sending One-Time Passwords via text message for online card payments.

From tinker tool to daily assistant: AI's quiet rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/from-tinker-tool-to-daily-assistant-ais-quiet-rise/articleshow/126360704.cms,"BENGALURU: For much of 2025, artificial intelligence did not enter people's lives through dramatic product launches or viral demos. Instead, it slipped in quietly, taking over small, repetitive tasks that many users barely noticed. What began as casual experimentation with chatbots has, for many, evolved into a set of everyday tools that now handle remembering, planning, drafting and filtering information in the background.One of the most common uses of AI today is as a personal memory and life ledger. Hyderabad-based AI product manager Saumya Shikhar uses ChatGPT to log work achievements, skills he is building and challenges he encounters on the job. He also maintains separate chats to track RBI interest rate movements that affect his loan repayments, and another to record his health history. ""That way, I feel like I have personal assistants with infinite memory and quick wisdom all the time,"" he said.Others are embedding AI even more deeply into their daily recall. Vignesh Ramakrishnan, founder of a Bengaluru-based AI consulting firm, built a WhatsApp-based AI assistant that acts as his operational memory.The system logs voice notes, handwritten notes, calendar entries and client conversations, and can retrieve details weeks later on request. ""Earlier, client details were scattered across chats, notes and spreadsheets,"" he said. ""Now I just ask one place.""Another widespread shift is the use of AI to filter signal from noise. Instead of scanning crowded inboxes or unread newsletters, users increasingly rely on AI-powered curation tools. Dr Sneha Jain uses Readerwise and Pocket to curate and prioritise what she reads during the week.""I start each morning by scanning only high-signal insights instead of wading through inbox noise,"" she said, adding that saved articles now resurface during short breaks between meetings, turning idle minutes into focused reading time.Drafting and structuring work remains one of the most common daily uses of AI. Tools such as ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot are now routinely used to turn rough thoughts into first drafts of emails, notes and long-form documents.Newer tools like Gemini's Nano Banana and Gamma are increasingly being used to generate presentation visuals and slide decks from basic prompts. Meeting-focused tools such as Granola are also gaining traction for recording conversations and auto-generating summaries and action points. Founder and author Pavan Govindan said the biggest change has been the removal of thinking friction. ""AI hasn't replaced judgment or creativity,"" he said. ""It has replaced the blank-page problem.""","Artificial intelligence is taking over small, repetitive tasks that many users barely noticed.

Microsoft Edge adopts Copilot's design language in major UI overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-edge-adopts-copilots-design-language-in-major-ui-overhaul/articleshow/126359078.cms,"Microsoft is giving its Edge browser a significant visual overhaul, adopting the sleek design of its Copilot AI. This refresh, currently in testing, brings rounded corners and new color schemes across the browser's interface. This move signals a broader push for a unified, AI-driven look across Microsoft's services, aiming to integrate experiences rather than launch entirely new ones.

A unified look across Microsoft's AI tools





Microsoft is rolling out a visual refresh for its Edge browser, borrowing heavily from the design language of its Copilot AI assistant. The changes are currently being tested in early Canary and Dev channel builds, marking what could be the beginning of a broader design shift across Microsoft's product lineup.The redesign touches nearly every part of the browser interface. The new tab page, settings menu, context menus, and dropdown elements all now feature the rounded corners, color schemes, and typography that debuted with the Copilot app. According to Windows Central, these changes appear regardless of whether users have Copilot Mode enabled, though the new tab page adapts based on the setting.This move represents a departure from Microsoft's established Fluent Design system, which currently powers Windows 11, Xbox, and Office. The Copilot design language originally emerged after most of the Inflection AI team joined Microsoft in 2024, bearing striking similarities to the Pi AI assistant Inflection had developed.Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman confirmed last year that the company plans to evolve Edge rather than create an entirely new AI-focused browser. ""There isn't going to be a new browser; this is just going to be one experience,"" Suleyman told The Verge's Tom Warren.The Edge browser is not the only interface being reworked. In addition, Microsoft is also exploring the use of its copilot design language Copilot Discover, which is an AI-driven version of the MSN.com site. Although the new look has not been implemented in Windows or Xbox, the overall trend here is towards a unified look for its services, which is AI-driven.The new interface is currently in the preview stage, and it will probably be several weeks before it makes it to the stable version of the Edge browser.","Microsoft is rolling out a visual refresh for its Edge browser, borrowing heavily from the design language of its Copilot AI assistant.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Skyscanner has these three 'tips' for you to buy cheap air tickets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/skyscanner-has-these-three-tips-for-you-to-buy-cheap-air-tickets/articleshow/126355672.cms,"Tip 1: Know where it's cheapest to go

Tip 2: Become a pro in tracking prices

Search for a flight in the Skyscanner app

Tap the heart icon to save your favourite flights.

Tip 3: Compare prices in a single view

""Cheapest Month""

""Whole Month""

""Flexible dates""





Flight prices can feel like a guessing game. One day a ticket costs one amount, the next day it's completely different. Many travelers end up spending more than they need to simply because they don't know when to book or where to look for deals. This is especially frustrating when you're trying to stick to a travel budget but still want to explore new places. Rather than endlessly searching different dates and destinations hoping to stumble upon a good deal, consider using tools that do the hard work for you.Skyscanner, which is a popular flight aggregator service, offers multiple useful tools that can help you find the cheapest air tickets without the hassle. These tools are designed to save you time and money and can be used by users if they're flexible about their destination, travel dates, or both. Here's everything you need to know about finding affordable flights using Skyscanner's three key tips.One of the biggest barriers to finding cheap flights is being locked into a specific destination. Skyscanner's ""Explore Everywhere"" feature solves this by letting you search for ""Everywhere"" rather than a particular city.The tool shows all places you can fly to from your airport, organised by price from cheapest to most expensive.To use the feature, users can visit Skyscanner’s website or app and enter their departure city. They can then select “Everywhere” as the destination and choose travel dates or pick the “Cheapest month” option if their plans are flexible. Skyscanner will show users destination results sorted by price, with filters available for direct flights, specific airlines, or regions. This can be a useful one for travellers who want the best deals and are open to different destinations.As flight prices change often, checking them every day can be time-consuming. To solve this issue, Skyscanner offers tools like Price Alerts and the Saved Feature. These tools help users to track fares automatically.The Saved feature works like a travel wishlist. This feature allows users to save flights and organise them into lists. Meanwhile, the ‘Price Alerts’ feature monitor these saved flights and notify users when prices change.Users who want to set up this feature will need to follow these steps:Once this feature is set up, it will make it easier for users to book at the right time without constantly checking flight ticket prices.One thing that matters the most while booking flights is the timing. Skyscanner's flexible dates feature shows prices for different days or months in one calendar view. This includes options such as thefeature, which identifies the month that has the lowest prices overall, while thetool provides day-by-day pricing for your chosen month.To use this feature, users have to enter their cities, click, and choose their preferred option. Once it's set up, users can review the grid showing the lowest recent fares and select dates that fit your budget. Both features work on Skyscanner’s desktop site and mobile app.The prices shown are estimates based on recent searches and can change quickly, so book soon when you find a good deal.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Elon Musk has recently focused attention on the AI tool for the creation of images and videos by xAI’s Grok Imagine, with a thread about guidelines for the creation of aesthetically attractive and cinematic content. Elon Musk recently posted a thread that directed attention to a guiding article by AI enthusiast @karatademada with instructions and explanations that highlight the effectiveness of storytelling in improving the output of AI-generated media. Unlike common AI tools for the creation of images that depend on the description of an object, Grok AI is highly successful with descriptions that focus on emotion, ambience, lighting, and camera angles, according to the article posted by Elon Musk.Grok Imagine is an AI-powered creative tool designed to help users generate cinematic-quality images and videos from simple text prompts. By combining advanced image generation with dynamic visual styling, it allows creators to experiment with lighting, composition, and motion without technical expertise.Users of Grok Imagine are taught one of the most important lessons in moving away from simple, descriptive prompts.Instead of writing, ""A woman walking on a street,"" for instance, they should be thinking about how to direct the scene: ""Cinematic shot of a woman walking alone on a rainy Paris street at night, reflections of neon lights on wet pavement, filmed in 4K, directed by Christopher Nolan, atmospheric and moody. "" By setting the mood and style, users really let the AI interpret the story behind an image rather than just objects in their own space.Grok Imagine does well with emotional context. Instead of ""A happy girl under the sun,"" a more illustrative and emotionally evocative prompt would be: “Close-up of a carefree young woman laughing under golden sunlight, wind blowing through her hair, summer energy, cinematic lens flare, warm tone."" By including how it should make the viewer feel in the image, the AI can create compositions that really carry emotional depth and engagement, making them appear much more lifelike and compelling.Camera perspective and cinematography terms are critical for creating dramatic scenes. Users are capable of defining a wide establishing shot, a low-angle shot, or a close-up shot. These definitions include: “Wide establishing shot of a futuristic city skyline at dawn, soft mist, glowing reflections on glass towers, slow camera pan,” or “Low-angle cinematic shot of a hero standing on a rooftop, coat flapping, sun behind silhouette. ” These descriptive terms enable Grok Imagine to render scenes with a cinematic perspective.The following five aspects must be involved within the prompt for high-quality results to be achieved consistently:By dissecting the prompt into these elements, it becomes certain that the AI will comprehend the entire scene and generate images that correspond to the user’s vision.Grok Imagine allows the refinement of images in increments. New scenes can be improved or changed by stating the additional elements: Same picture, but include soft morning sunlight filtering through the window, a cup of cappuccino on the table, and the Paris skyline reflected in the glass. In much larger ways, complete scene transformation is also accomplished: Change the same scene into a cyber café scene in the future, a place of holographic menus and digital rain.The creation of better AI-generated images is an iterative process. Users can take the advice offered to improve their prompts through the use of language, style, and composition. An example would be to take a basic prompt, Portrait of a woman holding flowers,"" and improve it in the following manner: Cinematic portrait of a woman holding yellow tulips; soft focus; 85mm lens; soft morning light.","Elon Musk recently posted an article about how to use Grok Imagine to create cinematic AI images and videos.
