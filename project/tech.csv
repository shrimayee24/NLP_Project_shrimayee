A cab driver put out a list of six rules, including ""don't call us bhaiya"" for passengers, igniting a lively discussion on Reddit with users divided between those who commend his approach and those who find the rules overly strict.In the list, the Cab drivers asked the passengers to ""put your attitude in your pockets. Please don't show up to us because you are not giving more money to us.""The cab driver also reminded passengers that they are not the owners of the vehicle.“The person driving the cab is the owner of the cab,” read his guidelines.One of the most interesting points in the driver's list, which sparked a significant portion of the debate, was his request that passengers refrain from calling him ""bhaiya"" (brother), arguing that it was both unnecessary and potentially disrespectful.One of the users said, ""Most points are fair but what's with - don't call us bhaiya?"" Another user said, ""As for the “bhaiya” part I understand it comes off as weird but I don’t think there’s anything wrong in calling them with whatever works in their regional language. It’s just a word you have to get acquainted yourself with.""The cab driver also made it clear that although passengers are paying for the service, they do not own the vehicle.He also stressed the importance of basic manners, such as closing the door gently and communicating respectfully.Some of the users appreciated the move and said, ""In a country where drivers are not respected, they have to unfortunately demand it. Good move.""""He’s right and there’s nothing wrong with his guidelines. Our country people has this habit of looking down on cab drivers, delivery people and stuff.

"At ‘Fama’, all faiths seek blessings of Infant Jesus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/at-fama-all-faiths-seek-blessings-of-infant-jesus/articleshow/114227707.cms,"Colva

:

The annual Fama celebration was held on Monday at the Our Lady of Mercy Church in Colva. Thousands of devotees gathered to seek blessings from the revered ‘Menino Jesu’ ( Infant Jesus ), a tradition that draws faithful from across the region.Parish priest Fr Simplicio Fernandes led the High Mass at 5.30am, alongside other clergy members. During the ceremony, the statue of Infant Jesus was ceremonially removed from its casket, placed on the altar, and then carried in a procession around the church.After this,the statue was made available to devotees to pay their respects.The belief in the powers of the Infant Jesus statue, and even the ring on its finger, transcends religious boundaries. People of various faiths come to the church to seek divine intervention for different reasons—couples pray for the gift of children, the sick seek healing from ailments like fractures, and others request blessings for their marriages.Despite the scorching heat, many, including young mothers and their children, patiently stood in long queues to kiss the statue. In particular, infants are often brought to the Fama to receive a blessing from Infant Jesus.Local lore tells of a time when Colva’s residents would prepare their homes by cleaning and whitewashing the walls, and stocking up on food, ready to welcome the countless pilgrims who journeyed to honour Infant Jesus.An integral part of the Fama is the erection of the ‘maadi’ (pole), providing shade to the cradle of Infant Jesus. Devotees also tie ‘bentim’—wrist cords symbolising faith and good fortune—when seeking blessings.To ensure smooth proceedings, Colva police and traffic personnel diverted vehicles through internal routes, ensuring uninterrupted access for pilgrims. A bomb disposal squad and CCTV surveillance were also deployed for security of the event.","The annual Fama celebration was held on Monday at the Our Lady of Mercy Church in Colva.

My Night At P Diddy's Freak Off-Tanea

A former guest at one of P Diddy’s notorious parties has shared shocking details, describing scenes that included little people dressed as Harold Juku dolls, among other unsettling behaviours at the rapper's 'freak off' parties. Speaking toTanea, who attended the party, recounted her experience alleging that upon arrival at the party, security was tight, and attendees were forced to hand over their phones, which were sealed in bubble cases to prevent any unauthorised photos or videos.While walking around the party, Tanea claimed that she was approached by one of P Diddy's sons, who selectively invited certain attendees into the main house, where the more private aspects of the 'Freak Off' took place. They said, “You couldn’t just walk into the house – you had to be chosen.” Those selected were reportedly given a pair of white shoes, signifying that they were permitted access to the house.Once inside, the guest described the atmosphere as chaotic, with loud house music blasting, making it difficult to see or hear clearly. “People were walking around naked, skinny dipping in the pool, drinking mimosas,” she recalled. Waitresses reportedly roamed the venue, passing out drinks to partygoers.However, what stood out most to the guest was the sight of little people dressed up like Harold Juku dolls, complete with red lipstick. “It looked like some sort of fetish,” she said.""I'm looking like, what are they doing here? Like dressed up little red lipstick. Like they weren't supposed to be there, but I'm just looking like maybe it's some type of production going on.""""But why would they be at this party at seven o'clock in the morning with grown people? Why would they be here?"" Tanea questioned.Tanea also noticed the presence of several Instagram models and was approached by P Diddy himself, who engaged them in a conversation. “He started talking about Cuba, asking if I was going to go with them,” she said. The guest also mentioned feeling increasingly uncomfortable as she noticed people around them engaging in explicit activities. “It was like something you see in the movies,” Tanea said.These revelations come at a time when P Diddy, is facing federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The rapper is accused of using his business empire, including Bad Boy Entertainment , to facilitate illegal activities at these infamous 'Freak Off' parties. The trial is set to begin in May 2024, with Combs pleading not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could face a minimum of 15 years in prison.","P Diddy is facing federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges.

Ten-year-old Renad Attallah has become an unexpected beacon of hope through her cooking tutorials on Instagram, shared from the heart of the Gaza Strip . Despite the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Renad’s cheerful videos showcase creative ways to prepare meals using the limited ingredients available in a conflict-ridden region. “We stay up without caffeine; coffee is just a bonus,” she says while demonstrating her version of iced coffee.Renad’s tutorials cover a range of dishes, including a burger made with luncheon meat from aid packages, caramelised sugar lollipops, and a honey cake improvised with powdered milk.Cooking, for her, is a source of comfort. “Whenever I’m sad, I try to make a chocolate mug cake,” she says, using her kitchen as a refuge from the harsh realities of life in Gaza.Living in a shelter with her mother and sisters, Renad has continued to post videos from their temporary home, often seen unboxing aid packages or whipping up a "" War Sandwich "" using sparse ingredients. In one tutorial, she prepares fish tenders, explaining, “Normally we use fillet fish, but it hasn’t been available for 11 months. I got hold of some un-fresh fish which became available only in the last two months. But for me, I prefer fish more than chicken—what about you?”Her recipes and captions not only highlight the food but also the emotional weight of life in a conflict zone. In one post, Renad reflects on a vermicelli dish that reminds her of peaceful Friday breakfasts before the war. “Now, there are no studies, no work, and no Friday celebrations—only the vermicelli and the tiredness remain.”Renad has garnered a global following, using her platform to encourage donations for feeding families in Gaza. Her Instagram bio reads, “All profits from my collection go towards feeding the children of Palestine ,” blending creativity with activism in her quest to bring hope to her community","Renad Attallah has become an unexpected beacon of hope through her cooking tutorials on Instagram.

There's like 1% of people can see pink grasshoppers in their lifetime. So, I am so lucky to be able to see it.

What is absentee ballot?

How to vote absentee if you live in US?

Being unable to get to your polling place due to illness, injury, or disability

Being on business travel or vacation outside of your county or city of residence on Election Day

Being a student at an out-of-state college or university""

Who can and cannot vote absentee

The United States is gearing up for the upcoming presidential election , with several states already offering early voting options to their residents.Despite being a long-standing practice in US elections, early voting has recently come under scrutiny with unfounded allegations of voter fraud . Advocates for voting rights emphasize the importance of early voting in ensuring that all eligible voters have the opportunity to participate in the democratic process, regardless of any personal circumstances that may hinder them from casting their ballot on election day, which falls on November 5 this year.Currently, all 50 states offer some form of early voting, with mail-in voting being the most common option.At least eight states automatically send mail-in ballots to all registered voters, while 14 states still require voters to provide a justification for requesting an "" absentee ballot "" to vote by mail.Absentee voting allows individuals who cannot or choose not to visit their designated polling station to cast their vote through alternative means. These options include voting at a different location, postal voting, proxy voting, and online voting. Many view increasing access to absentee ballots as a method to boost voter turnout by making voting more convenient, which is known as convenience voting. However, some countries have requirements in place, such as infirmity or travel, that voters must meet before being allowed to use an absentee ballot.To obtain your ballot, go to 'Can I Vote' and select your state from the dropdown menu. This will direct you to your state's absentee voting or vote-by-mail page. Depending on your state, you may need a valid reason to vote absentee, as per US government.Common acceptable excuses include:Be aware of your state's deadlines for requesting and returning your absentee or vote-by-mail ballot. Check your state's voting deadlines and pay attention to whether the deadline is for when your ballot must be postmarked or received by the election office.If you have relocated, you must update your voter registration with your new address before requesting an absentee or vote-by-mail ballot. Depending on your state, you may need to submit a new voter registration form, sign and mail a form notifying your state's election office of your address change, or update your address online. Contact your state or local election office for information on how to update your address.Lastly, check with your state or local election office about alternative methods for returning your ballot besides postal mail. Some states offer ballot drop boxes, and many allow you to return your ballot in person at your local election office or another designated location.Absentee voting is available to certain individuals who are unable to cast their ballots in person. This includes military members and their families who are stationed outside of their legal voting residence. Additionally, U.S. citizens living abroad who previously resided in the United States are eligible to vote absentee.However, US citizens who were born outside of the country and have never lived within its borders may face restrictions on absentee voting. It is recommended to review the specific regulations of the state where the individual's parent or legal guardian last resided to determine eligibility.","Absentee voting allows individuals who cannot or choose not to visit their designated polling station to cast their vote through alternative means.

Watch: Young Sheldon scene that predicted reality about SpaceX catching its rocket featuring Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-young-sheldon-scene-that-predicted-reality-about-spacex-catching-its-rocket-featuring-elon-musk/articleshow/114206739.cms,"When Elon Musk Reads Sheldon's Notes | Young Sheldon [FullHD] @musicabae5675

While ""The Simpsons"" is famed for its eerie ability to predict future events, it seems ""Young Sheldon"" has now entered the same realm of prophetic television. In a particular scene from the show, young Sheldon explains complex rocket landing maneuvers—years before SpaceX , led by Elon Musk , accomplished a strikingly similar feat.In the episode, Sheldon describes how a rocket could be flipped and landed using a PID controller , but the doctor he’s speaking with dismisses it as a theoretical concept, stating that the technology simply doesn’t exist to execute it.Sheldon confidently replies, ""So I'm ahead of my time."" The show also pokes fun at Elon Musk, showing him stealing ideas from a book by young Sheldon and passing them off as his own.Fast forward to reality, and SpaceX has indeed caught up with Sheldon’s visionary explanation. On Sunday, SpaceX achieved a significant breakthrough by successfully catching the booster of its Starship rocket using mechanical arms, a move SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called “science fiction without the fiction part.” The booster, after launching from Texas, was deftly caught by the metal arms dubbed “chopsticks” attached to the launch tower. The achievement marks a critical milestone in Musk’s ambitious plan to make humanity a multiplanetary species.Elon Musk took to X, formerly Twitter, exclaiming, “The tower has caught the rocket!! Big step towards making life multiplanetary was made today.” The accomplishment triggered celebrations at SpaceX headquarters and NASA, with SpaceX employees cheering as the booster was secured.Much like Sheldon’s theoretical vision in ""Young Sheldon,"" SpaceX’s success in catching its booster represents a leap in engineering. Musk's vision for reusable rockets has become a reality, paving the way for future missions to the moon and Mars.","Sheldon on ""Young Sheldon"" explains how a rocket could be flipped and landed using a PID controller.

To further encourage wider adoption of UPI and make it more inclusive, it has been decided:

First, to enhance the per transaction limit in UPI 123Pay from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000

from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 It has also been decided to increase the UPI Lite wallet limit from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000, and per transaction limit from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000

What is UPI Lite Wallet & UPI 123PAY?

New UPI transaction limits announced: In good news for UPI users, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday announced that the UPI transaction limits will be enhanced. “UPI has transformed India's financial landscape by making digital payments accessible and inclusive through continuous innovation and adaptation,” he said.Shaktikanta Das made this announcement as part of his monetary policy statement.The RBI governor said:Shaktikanta Das also said, “At present, UPI and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) provide a facility for the remitter of funds to verify the name of the receiver (beneficiary) before executing a payment transaction. It is now proposed to introduce such a facility for the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system.”“This facility will enable the remitter to verify the name of the account holder before effecting funds transfer to him/her through RTGS or NEFT. This will also reduce the possibility of wrong credits and frauds,” he said.UPI Lite is a feature that enables users to make UPI transactions without entering their UPI PIN for amounts up to Rs 500 per transaction. In the future, this limit will be increased to Rs 1000 per transaction, allowing for even more convenient and seamless payments.To take advantage of UPI Lite, users must first add funds to their UPI Lite wallet. Previously, the maximum amount that could be added to the wallet was Rs 2,000.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
