Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-chip company, has implanted its brain-computer interface (BCI) in a sixth person. The update came from Rob Grenier, who shared his experience on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) earlier this week. ""Absolutely amazing what I can do already in under a week with Neuralink!"" Grenier posted, along with a video showing him playing a computer game and moving a cursor using only his thoughts.Grenier became quadriplegic after a car accident in December 2022. The incident left him paralyzed from the neck down. “I can't thank the Neuralink team, the doctors, the surgeons and all of my family and friends' support. It may only look like I'm doing a couple games but it's been under a week and I'm already shocked!” he added in the post.The announcement comes as Neuralink raised over $650 million in its Series E funding round, bringing its valuation to $9 billion. The Series E round attracted major investors including ARK Invest, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, and several others, valuing the company at approximately $9 billion pre-money according to recent reports. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is among the company’s major backers.The funding represented a significant increase from Neuralink's $280 million Series D round in August 2023.Neuralink has launched clinical trials at leading medical institutions across three countries, including Barrow Neurological Institute, The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami, University Health Network in Toronto, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.It is now preparing for a human trial of its Blindsight chip in partnership with the UAE's Cleveland Clinic in 2026.Musk had earlier said, “With Neuralink interfacing directly to the visual cortex, even those who are completely blind will be able to see again.”",Rob Grenier became quadriplegic after a car accident in December 2022.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasize this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organizations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.","Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases.

Google’s Veo 3 to enhance Shorts content creation

Alcatel V3 Ultra Unboxing & Hands-on | Dual Display Mode, Sleek Design & More!

YouTube will integrate Google’s latest AI video generation model, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this year, CEO Neal Mohan announced. Speaking at a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival, Mohan said “The possibilities with AI are limitless”. He was joined by creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum. “A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution,” Mohan added.YouTube currently uses an earlier version of Veo in its Dream Screen feature, which creates AI-generated backgrounds. Veo 3 marks a major upgrade, offering more advanced video creation tools. Google released the Veo 3 tool last month at I/O 2025. The AI-powered video generation tool allows users to generate videos from text and image prompts.Mohan said the new tool will “open new creative lanes” for Shorts creators, helping them experiment with content formats. YouTube Shorts, launched in 2021, now sees over 200 billion views per day, according to Mohan. Its growing popularity puts it in direct competition with TikTok and Instagram Reels.Mohan emphasized the role of creators in shaping modern entertainment. “My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he said.“Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”","YouTube will integrate Google’s latest AI video generation model, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this year, CEO Neal Mohan announced.

Apple foldable iPhone: Likely specs and design



Apple foldable iPhone initial shipments



Apple foldable iPhone: Likely price



Apple is expected to enter the foldable smartphone market next year. As per the popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , the iPhone maker may launch its first foldable iPhone in 2026. Kuo has revealed that Apple may start manufacturing the much-awaited foldable iPhone in late Q3 or Q4 of 2025. “Assembly supplier Foxconn is expected to officially kick off the project in late 3Q25 or early 4Q25. As of now, many component specifications (including the hinge, which has drawn considerable market attention) have yet to be finalized,” wrote Kuo in a post on X.As per Kuo, the first foldable iPhone is said to feature a ""book-style"" design, akin to Samsung's Galaxy Fold series, rather than a clamshell form factor. The yet to launch foldable iPhone is tipped to feature a 7.8-inch internal display designed to be ""crease-free,"" a significant engineering feat that would differentiate it from many current foldable offerings. The external display is said to measure 5.5-inches.“The foldable display is one of the few components with finalized specifications and serves as a good reference for estimating potential shipments. Samsung Display (SDC) plans to build annual production capacity for 7-8 million foldable panels to supply the 2026 foldable iPhone. Given that actual production in 2026 may span only a few months, panel shipments that year are likely to fall short of full capacity.” Added Kuo.Further details emerging from Kuo's analysis suggest the device will boast a titanium alloy chassis, a dual-camera system, and an impressively thin profile, measuring under 5mm when unfolded and between 9-9.5mm when folded. Due to internal space considerations, the foldable iPhone may incorporate Touch ID as a side-mounted sensor instead of Face ID.Initial shipments for the foldable iPhone are projected to be between 3 to 5 million units in 2026. Apple has reportedly placed a total order for 15 to 20 million foldable iPhones, but this volume is expected to be spread across a two to three-year product lifecycle, suggesting a more gradual market adoption for what is expected to be a premium-priced device.“Recent market rumors suggest Apple has placed an order for 15–20 million foldable iPhones. Based on checks across multiple components, this volume likely reflects cumulative demand over the product’s 2–3 year lifecycle, rather than 2026 alone. This indicates that Apple’s foldable iPhone, expected to enter mass production in 2H26, may ship several million units annually in both 2027 and 2028, possibly due to its premium pricing,” said Kuo.Rumors indicate the foldable iPhone could carry a price tag upwards of $2,000 to $2,500 (approximately Rs 1.73 lakh to Rs 2.16 lakh).","Apple is expected to enter the foldable smartphone market next year.

"Wife’s WhatsApp chats obtained via 'spy app' used as valid evidence about her extramarital affair in Divorce case, what Madhya Pradesh HC said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wifes-whatsapp-chats-obtained-via-spy-app-used-as-valid-evidence-about-her-extramarital-affair-in-divorce-case-what-madhya-pradesh-hc-said/articleshow/121986405.cms,"In a crucial ruling, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has reportedly permitted a husband to present his wife’s private WhatsApp chats as evidence in a divorce case, even though they were obtained without her consent. The court’s decision, based on Section 14 of the Family Courts Act , 1984, allows Family Courts to consider evidence that may not be admissible under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, to resolve disputes like divorce.The case arose when the husband, using a special app (spy app) installed on his wife’s phone without her knowledge, accessed her private WhatsApp conversations. These chats allegedly revealed an extramarital affair, prompting the husband to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty and adultery. The wife’s legal team objected, arguing that presenting the chats violated her right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution and Sections 43, 66, and 72 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. They further contended that evidence obtained illegally should be inadmissible.Rejecting these arguments, the High Court emphasized that while the right to privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21, it is not absolute and is subject to limitations. Citing Supreme Court judgments, including the Sharda and Puttaswami cases, the court noted that statutory provisions like Section 14 of the Family Courts Act and Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act permit limited invasions of privacy in the interest of justice.The court framed the issue as a conflict between two fundamental rights under Article 21: the wife’s right to privacy and the husband’s right to a fair trial. It ruled that the right to privacy must yield to the right to a fair trial, which has broader implications for public justice. “A litigating party has a right to bring relevant evidence before the court,” the court stated, adding that denying this opportunity would undermine the Family Courts Act’s intent.The High Court clarified that it was not ruling on the authenticity of the WhatsApp chats, leaving that determination to the Family Court. If the chats are deemed genuine, they could support the husband’s case for divorce on grounds of cruelty and adultery.This ruling has sparked debate over the balance between privacy rights and the pursuit of justice in family disputes, with potential implications for how digital evidence is handled in Indian courts.","The Madhya Pradesh High Court has reportedly permitted a husband to present his wife's private WhatsApp chats as evidence in a divorce case. The chats allegedly revealed an extramarital affair, prompting the husband to seek divorce on grounds of cruelty and adultery. The wife’s legal team objected, arguing that presenting the chats violated her right to privacy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121986399,imgsize-1628574,width-400,resizemode-4/WhatsApp.jpg"

Dandy vibes and designer swagger in Milan

NFL uncertainty looms behind the glamour



Fans torn between style and sidelines



NFL star Stefon Diggs lit up the Milan runway at PDF.Channel’s SS26 show, blending bold fashion with Black dandy elegance. But as cameras flashed in Italy, storm clouds swirled back home—thanks to contract drama, injury concerns, and a viral yacht video. His debut arrives at a high-stakes moment, straddling fashion buzz and NFL headlines—commanding attention far beyond the football field.At PDF.Channel’s vibrant SS26 showcase, Diggs turned heads with a velvet jacket, crisp tailoring, and sleek accessories. Inspired by late ’70s and ’80s Black dandyism, his look channeled pride, heritage, and elegance. At the runway’s end, Diggs held his pose with calm confidence, exuding part swagger, part statement. The flashbulbs captured more than a walk—it felt like a cultural performance wrapped in style.Fashion bloggers praised the debut: “Diggs oozed confidence and authenticity. Easily one of the best athlete runway moments in years.” Social feeds called it “a cultural moment, not just a fashion one,” with fans praising his poise and presence.Back in the U.S., Diggs faces scrutiny after a now‑viral yacht video surfaced showing him with Cardi B and a suspicious pink substance.While no official violation has been confirmed, the footage has stirred speculation. His current Patriots deal—a $69M contract with roughly $26M guaranteed—could be jeopardized if he fails a full physical or is found in breach. Coach Mike Vrabel urged “great decisions on and off the field,” when asked about the footage.While fashion insiders applauded Diggs’ Milan moment, NFL fans voiced split opinions online. One user on X (Twitter) wrote, “I love this for Diggs—NFL stars need to embrace style like this more often.” But Reddit threads leaned cautious, “Stefon Diggs at 31 coming off an ACL injury—really hope this works out.” And regarding the viral yacht clip, “Unidentified pink substance? Not a good look this close to training camp. ”Also read: “C***ne is a hell of a drug”: Stefon Diggs slammed for wild wedding dance amid ACL recovery and Cardi B drama Though Diggs has resumed participation at OTAs, full clearance is still pending post-ACL surgery.

Meanwhile, Diggs’ Milan success may widen his brand reach—but his NFL future remains in delicate balance.","NFL star Stefon Diggs walked in PDF.Channel’s SS26 show in Milan.

The Progressive Soup



The Independents, the Billionaires, and the Ballot Hobbyists



Curtis Sliwa – The Red-Beret Rerun



Perception vs. Performance – The Real Contest



Final Notes from Gotham







In, Wilson Fisk—the Kingpin of Crime—doesn’t just manipulate the system; he becomes Mayor of New York. Because in the Marvel Universe, the best way to consolidate criminal power isn’t through backroom deals—it’s by getting elected. A comic book storyline? Maybe. But in 2025 New York, fiction and politics are on disturbingly good terms.This is the city where Sinatra sang about making it big, Trump gold-plated his ego, and aliens always seem to start their invasions. So naturally, New York’s mayoral race couldn’t just be another bland contest of platforms and pamphlets—it had to be a full-blown cinematic crossover event.The incumbent, Eric Adams, entered 2025 under a federal indictment—only to be miraculously rescued by the Trump Justice Department. Unburdened but politically bruised, Adams bailed on the Democratic primary and now seeks reelection as an independent via two oddly branded ballot lines: Safe Streets, Affordable City and EndAntiSemitism. Think DJ Khaled meets Bloomberg, but with more subpoenas.In the Democratic primary, the drama centres on two men who couldn’t be more different if they tried: Andrew Cuomo, the scandal-drenched ex-Governor staging a Nixonian comeback, and Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist from Queens endorsed by AOC, Bernie Sanders, the Working Families Party, and anyone who uses the phrase “neoliberal hellscape” without irony.Trailing them is a whole gallery of political side characters: Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, State Senators Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos, hedge fund crusader Whitney Tilson, integrity lawyer Jim Walden, and the ever-returning vigilante Curtis Sliwa, whose red beret remains the most consistent part of Republican strategy in NYC.Adams’ first term was less a public service than a multi-season streaming show. Crime stats, police drama, migrant shelter chaos, zoning reforms, a revolving cast of commissioners—and all of it interspersed with nightclub appearances and cryptic Instagram captions.Then came the indictment. Then came the acquittal. Now, Adams has reinvented himself as the “competence candidate,” reminding voters that murders are down, rezonings are up, and hey—at least he’s not a felon.But public memory is short and sharp. Most New Yorkers remember the headlines, not the metrics. They remember the vibe. And the vibe was: chaos, ego, and subpoenas. If Adams wins, it’ll be a masterclass in narrative control. If he loses, it’ll be because even New York eventually gets tired of being gaslit.Cuomo is back. Not because New Yorkers missed him, but because Cuomo missed being Cuomo. His campaign pitch? “Experience matters.” His campaign vibe? “Please forget everything after 2019.”He’s armed with union endorsements, a donor Rolodex fat enough to crush a CitiBike, and the smug certainty of a man who believes he built the state and should get a second chance to ruin the city.But every speech, every op-ed, every photo-op brings back the ghosts: the nursing home scandal, the sexual harassment accusations, the press briefings that felt like hostage negotiations. He’s polling well among moderates, but even his supporters admit it’s less about enthusiasm and more about resignation. Cuomo is the electoral equivalent of a nicotine patch: addictive, unsatisfying, and kind of gross.Where Cuomo evokes the past, Zohran Mamdani is the embodiment of political future-shock. Young, Ugandan-Indian, socialist, multilingual, and unapologetically radical, Mamdani offers New York a campaign that reads like a progressive fever dream: a $30 minimum wage, rent freezes, free public transit, and publicly-owned grocery stores.He’s adored by the left, feared by centrists, and targeted by conservatives who struggle to pronounce “Astoria” without wincing. His campaign ads are multilingual, his rallies are electric, and his vibe is pure disruption.But New York is a city that loves the idea of revolution—as long as it arrives in the back of an Uber. Can a city that claps for social justice actually vote for it? Or will it smile at Mamdani’s poetry, then quietly fill in the bubble for Cuomo in the privacy of the booth?Brad Lander is the guy who shows up to a protest with anExcel sheet and a legal pad. Brooklyn-born, fiscally responsible, and ideologically moderate by progressive standards, Lander has built a reputation as the man who knows how to make the city run.His pitch is clear: data, ethics, efficiency. His platform includes housing reform, mental health infrastructure, and fiscal transparency. He’s the candidate who reads the fine print—probably because he wrote it.But charisma matters. In a race filled with rappers, rogues, and reformed governors, Lander is the competent dad trying to DJ the party. He’s quietly gaining steam, especially among voters fatigued by Cuomo and wary of Mamdani. But unless he breaks out of his technocratic shell soon, he risks becoming everyone’s second choice—and no one’s winner.Jessica Ramos began her campaign as a worker-first progressive. Then she endorsed Cuomo, and her credibility evaporated faster than a Midtown apartment deposit. Zellnor Myrie staked his candidacy on housing, calling for one million new units. Admirable. But in a race dominated by Mamdani and Lander, he’s the third-most progressive in any room—and that’s not a great place to be.Adrienne Adams, drafted as the centrist peacemaker, offers measured leadership and broad endorsements. But her campaign has struggled to cut through. In a year where the political circus is running full tilt, being sensible might just be the fastest way to be forgotten.Everyone wants to be the “anti-Cuomo.” No one has figured out how to consolidate the vote. The result? Progressive fragmentation that makes a circular firing squad look efficient.Whitney Tilson is a charter school–loving hedge funder whose platform is basically “Run NYC like a spreadsheet.” He’s rich, loud, and terminally LinkedIn. Then there’s Jim Walden, a Bloombergian technocrat suing to be called an “independent” on the ballot, armed with powerpoints, white papers, and approximately five enthusiastic voters.These guys won’t win. But they will fill panels, clutter debates, and write Medium posts explaining why they should have.And finally: Curtis Sliwa, the vigilante. The red-bereted Ghost of Giuliani Past. Every few years he emerges like a Republican cicada—loud, angry, and allergic to nuance. He’s running on a platform of crime, more crime, fewer migrants, and feral cats as pest control.He won’t win. But if enough Democrats split the vote, he might finish second. Stranger things have happened. After all, this is the city where rats get pizza and mayors get indicted.This election isn’t about what candidates have done. It’s about what voters remember. And more importantly, what they feel.Adams has genuine achievements—but he feels like a nightclub manager with subpoena fatigue. Cuomo has experience—but his scandals still scream louder than his surrogates. Mamdani offers ideas—but he also scares the donor class. Lander is solid—but not sexy. And Sliwa is… available.The media knows it. Every headline is a meme. Every endorsement is a subtweet. Even the New York Times threw in the towel and endorsed no one—New York’s journalistic version of saying, “We’re out of ideas. Good luck, Gotham.”New York’s 2025 mayoral race isn’t ideological—it’s mythological. It’s about redemption arcs, origin stories, surprise villains, and broken heroes. It’s a city where Wilson Fisk becoming mayor wasn’t a warning—it was a prophecy.Will voters choose the devil they know (Cuomo)? The devil they fired (Adams)? The socialist the Right fears (Mamdani)? Or the nerd in glasses who actually might have a plan (Lander)?One thing is certain: whoever wins, they won’t just inherit New York—they’ll inherit its neuroses, contradictions, and the sacred duty of being yelled at in five languages before 10 AM.","In the Marvel Universe, the best way to consolidate criminal power isn’t through backroom deals—it’s by getting elected.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker has confirmed this feature in the invitations sent to influencers and investors. This passenger safety feature contradicts Elon Musk's previous assurances of fully unsupervised service. The invitations, which announced a June 22 launch date for the highly anticipated service, specify that the human monitor will ""accompany you on your trip."" This move marks a departure from Musk's earlier promises in January to launch ""unsupervised"" robotaxis with ""no one in the car"" this summer. In an April earnings call, Musk further explained that 10 to 20 Tesla Model Y vehicles would be remotely operated in emergencies. However, details regarding Tesla's robotaxi service have been scarce leading up to its launch.In the invitation, the company wrote:","Tesla's first robotaxi rides will include a human safety monitor in the front passenger seat.

This initiative, a part of the EU’s Green Deal, aims to reduce electronic waste, extend device lifespans, and empower consumers to make environmentally conscious purchasing decisions. The new rules mandate that devices carry standardized energy labels, prominently displaying scores for key attributes such as battery life, durability, and repairability. These labels, designed to be clear and consumer-friendly, include:* Energy Efficiency Class: Rated from A to G, indicating the device’s power efficiency.* Battery Life per Charge: Expressed in hours and minutes for real-world usage.* Battery Longevity: Measured in charge cycles, with a minimum requirement of retaining 80% capacity after 800 full cycles.* Repairability Score: Graded from A to E, reflecting ease of repair and access to spare parts.* Drop Resistance Rating: Indicating the device’s durability against physical damage.* Ingress Protection Score: Assessing resistance to dust and water.Each label also features a QR code linking to the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling (EPREL), where consumers can access detailed technical specifications and compare environmental performance across models.The regulations align closely with practices already adopted by industry leaders like Apple. Most iPhones receive software updates for over five years, and Apple provides official repair services, a self-service repair program, and access to genuine parts for out-of-warranty devices. However, the EU’s requirements introduce stricter formalities, particularly regarding battery performance and spare parts availability.Under the new rules, batteries must retain at least 80% of their original capacity after 800 charge cycles, a standard that may require manufacturers like Apple to adapt their testing to comply with the EU’s framework. While Apple publishes battery specifications online, formal compliance with the EU’s testing protocols could necessitate additional adjustments. Furthermore, manufacturers are now obligated to provide key spare parts for seven years after the last unit of a model is sold in the EU—a mandate that slightly exceeds Apple’s current support timeline of five to seven years.The EU’s push for sustainability is expected to influence global manufacturing standards, as companies adjust to meet the bloc’s rigorous requirements. Environmental groups have praised the move, citing its potential to curb the 14 million tons of electronic waste generated annually in the EU. However, some industry analysts warn that compliance costs could lead to higher device prices, particularly for budget models.","Starting June 20, 2025, the European Union has introduced new regulations requiring all smartphones and tablets sold within its borders to meet sustainability standards.

Viral comparisons reignite debate over body transformation



Brittany once clapped back at the same rumors in 2021



While Patrick Mahomes stays relatively low-key this offseason, Brittany’s bold style choices have made her the Mahomes making waves online. Brittany has once again become the center of cosmetic surgery speculation after her striking appearance at a Las Vegas event. Her bold fashion choice—a fitted, one-strap dress with a chest cutout—showed off a visibly fuller figure. As social media lit up with comparisons, fans and critics questioned whether she may have had breast implants. While Brittany hasn’t confirmed anything, the online chatter is louder than ever.Photos comparing her 2022 Coachella look to her 2025 Las Vegas outfit began trending online. One user on X remarked, ""Well, she's clearly had enhancements,"" fueling the plastic surgery buzz. Still, many came to her defense, attributing the changes to her recent pregnancy. The split in public opinion has only intensified since her latest post.Brittany, who gave birth six months ago to her third child with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, has posted pumped breast milk photos on Instagram, hinting she is still breastfeeding. One user explained, ""My boobs got gigantic when I nursed too. Also, if she is still nursing, she couldn't have had surgery.""This added weight to the argument for natural changes.These rumors aren’t new for Brittany. After her first child in 2021, she posted a bikini photo captioned, ""Haters will say they are fake, but breastfeeding moms will understand."" Though playful, the post made clear she was aware of the ongoing speculation. Despite addressing it, discussion around her chest size has only grown, especially after her Sports Illustrated swimsuit debut in 2024.She has been open about having lip fillers in past Q&A sessions, acknowledging her cosmetic choices without hesitation. That honesty has led fans to speculate further about procedures she hasn’t commented on. But nothing about breast augmentation has ever been confirmed or admitted. Her silence leaves room for speculation—but also for privacy.Also read: Patrick Mahomes' Super Bowl shame reignites debate — Is he still the NFL’s most feared quarterback?

Whether shaped by motherhood, fitness, or aesthetics, Brittany Mahomes’ transformation is making waves—and she’s clearly unfazed by the noise.","Brittany Mahomes' bold style choices have made her the Mahomes making waves online.

Fed up Erin Andrews calls for ban on public restroom selfies in no-holds-barred podcast moment



Erin Andrews has never been one to sugarcoat her thoughts, and her latest podcast appearance proves just that. In a fiery new episode of the Calm Down podcast, the Fox Sports icon didn’t hesitate to slam one of her biggest modern-day annoyances—bathroom selfies. And if you’ve ever been guilty of snapping a quick outfit pic next to a sink or paper towel dispenser, it might be time to reconsider your social media habits.Returning alongside co-host Charissa Thompson, Andrews dove straight into what she called one of her top pet peeves. While the Calm Down podcast often mixes light-hearted banter with serious commentary, this time, Andrews’ frustration was anything but subtle.“I got another complaint. The selfies in the bathroom of your super cute outfit are for the birds,” Andrews said during the episode. “I’m not gonna call you thirsty, but so, Desperado, to take a picture of your outfit and go ‘Here’s my outfit.’”Her comments weren’t just playful jabs—they were a direct critique of a growing trend that blends vanity with questionable hygiene choices. “Do you know how much bacteria and odors are in that place? Like, get out of the public bathroom and find another, like, no one needs to see the sink and paper towel dispenser as we’re getting a full-length view of your trashy outfit,” she continued.But she didn’t stop there. Andrews, clearly fed up with what she sees as a low point in digital culture, added, “Get out of the public restroom! It’s so bizarre. You’re that thirsty to document your outfit in a public restroom where people are walking around with sh*t on their shoes? I don’t get it. I’m sorry. Enough is enough. What has happened to our world?”Thompson, never one to shy away from a candid take, chimed in with her own disgust. “I just love it when you can actually see the toilet in the background… I’m like, I don’t want to see where you take a s---! I don’t. I’m not interested in that,” she said.While some may find their rants dramatic, their bold honesty has become a trademark of the Calm Down podcast. The duo often ventures far beyond the gridiron, using their platform to speak on everything from pop culture to personal gripes. Just recently, Andrews backed Taylor Swift for standing tall in her music rights dispute and even dubbed herself an “airport guru,” saying she “thrives” in chaotic travel situations.Thompson, who had missed a few recent episodes due to travel, rejoined Andrews for this one, reigniting the dynamic that fans of the show love. As the NFL offseason slows down, content like this keeps the podcast entertaining—and surprisingly relatable.And while bathroom selfies might not be outlawed anytime soon, Andrews’ stance is crystal clear: keep your fashion flexes out of the stalls.Also Read: Swifties donate big after Taylor Swift’s touching visit to children’s hospital where she mentioned her 'boyfriend' Travis Kelce",Erin Andrews slammed selfies in public restrooms in a new episode of the Calm Down podcast.

LeBron James ’ Trainwreck character explained



Trainwreck - Official Trailer (HD)

Los Angeles Lakers legend has tried acting as well. In 2025, he appeared in Judd Apatow’s acclaimed romantic comedy Trainwreck. Many critics and fans believe he was hilarious in the movie, where he portrayed a slightly exaggerated version of himself. Here’s what you need to know about the character James played in the comedy starring alongside Bill Hader and Amy Schumer.LeBron James surprised fans with something entirely different; it was a standout performance in Judd Apatow’s 2015 romantic comedy Trainwreck. James’ unexpected comedic timing and self-deprecating humor that stole more than a few scenes. His role wasn’t just a one-note celebrity cameo; it added depth, surprise, and plenty of laughs to the film.In Trainwreck, LeBron James plays the best friend of Aaron Conners, a New York-based sports doctor played by Bill Hader. Also, it’s worth noting that his character is a comedic version of himself. What’s instantly striking is how willing James is to poke fun at his own fame, fortune, and career controversies. Whether it’s joking about his infamous “Decision” to leave Cleveland or having Aaron foot the bill at lunch because he “forgot his wallet,” LeBron embraces a version of himself that’s charmingly cheap, emotionally sensitive, and surprisingly romantic.This fictional LeBron is deeply invested in Aaron's love life. He helps him craft texts, urges him to commit to Amy (played by Schumer), and even interrogates her with hilarious intensity, asking if she hears Aaron’s name. At one point, he sincerely grills her about whether Aaron is her “Cleveland,” showing off a mix of humor and heartfelt sincerity.LeBron James delivers a scene-stealing performance. What sets James apart in Trainwreck is the authenticity he brings to the screen. He delivers his lines with a laid-back confidence that makes even the most absurd dialogue land effortlessly. With his emotional openness and comedic deadpan.In a recent chat with the Hollywood Reporter’s Tony Maglio, James reflected on the movie and his potential acting career post-NBA retirement.“I think that all will boil down to the creative writing and to the role. If the role is appropriate and I feel like I can nail it, then I wouldn’t mind doing that at all. I feel like I could turn and be someone else that’s not LeBron James,” the future Hall of Famer said.James went on to explain, “In Trainwreck, my name was not LeBron James. But it was a version of me, my typical self, [just] playing Bill Hader’s best friend during that movie. But, yeah, I would love to explore, and if the scripts start to roll in and there’s an opportunity for me to do some acting and I have the time — obviously, post-career — I don’t mind looking at it and seeing if I can make it happen, for sure.”Also Read: ""Stay home with Savannah"": LeBron James' potential move to Amazon Prime NBA commentary sparks outrage and disappointment among fans Written by Amy Schumer, Trainwreck also features John Cena’s cameo.
