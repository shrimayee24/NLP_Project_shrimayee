NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with students from across the country during a special episode of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, offering guidance on exams, personal growth, discipline, leadership, technology use, and nation-building ahead of the board examination season.During his interaction with students from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, PM Modi expressed happiness over their aspirations, saying, ""I felt good to see that the students of Classes 10 and 12 in my country also carry the dream of Viksit Bharat 2047 in their minds. This is a matter of great happiness for me.""He emphasised the importance of disciplined habits, adding, ""We should adopt the habits of developed countries—we should turn off engines at red lights, we should not leave the food, and we should reduce wastage... Discipline is very important in our life...""On the use of technology, the prime minister advised students not to let smartphones or AI dominate their lives. He said, ""We should try not to make AI or mobile the master; some kids do not eat food unless they see the smartphone. We can use AI efficiently.""Highlighting the importance of physical and mental well-being, PM Modi stressed the need for proper rest. “The second biggest thing, which isn't on people's minds today, is sleep.One must get good sleep. After getting a full night's sleep, your mind stays very cheerful for the rest of the time.”He also reflected on his long association with students, adding, ""I have been interacting with students of Classes 10 and 12 for many years through Pariksha Pe Charcha. I engage in these conversations to learn, not to teach.""In a separate session with students from Raipur, Chhattisgarh, PM Modi shared traditional local snacks, Thethri and Khurmi. When asked to suggest five travel destinations for students, he advised them to first make a list of places near their district, city, and state, and then decide.PM Modi also encouraged students to support classmates who are weaker in studies. ""Students should befriend them and explain topics to them, adding that teaching others helps one learn better as well,"" he said. He stressed the importance of balancing sports with studies, reminding students of the mantra, ""Khelogey to khilogey.""""To become a leader, develop a mindset to take initiative... A leader does not only mean contesting elections, but a good leader should communicate ideas clearly and effectively,"" said PM Modi.PM Modi also interacted with students last week, providing guidance on exams, personal growth, skills, technology use, and nation-building ahead of the board examination season. During the session, he held wide-ranging discussions with students, covering topics such as exam stress, time management, leadership, wellness, and pursuing dreams. Students also showcased their creativity by performing self-composed songs for him.The 2026 edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha aims to help students stay stress-free during exams while promoting a stronger focus on learning, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.","PM Narendra Modi interacted with students from across the country during a special episode of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026.

Isro study shows safe patch near Moon’s Mons Mouton for Chandrayaan-4 landing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-study-shows-safe-patch-near-moons-mons-mouton-for-chandrayaan-4-landing/articleshow/128085691.cms,"ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

BENGALURU: Scientists from Isro ’s Space Applications Centre (SAC) have identified a promising landing zone in the rugged south polar region of the Moon for India’s first lunar sample return mission, Chandrayaan-4.A detailed terrain study using images from the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) has shortlisted a one-square-kilometre patch near Mons Mouton as the safest option for touchdown. The study, carried out by Amitabh, K Suresh, Ajay K Prashar, Kannan V Iyer, Abdul S, Shweta Verma Trivedi and Nitant Dube, has been accessed by TOI.Chandrayaan-4 will be Isro’s most complex lunar mission. The spacecraft will include a propulsion module, a descender module, an ascender module, a transfer module and a re-entry module. The descender and ascender stack must soft-land on the Moon, collect samples and launch them back to lunar orbit for return to Earth .Selecting the right site is crucial. Engineers must ensure gentle local slopes, adequate sunlight for at least 11-12 days, clear radio visibility to Earth, and minimal hazards such as craters and boulders. The lander design limits the acceptable slope to about 10° and requires boulders smaller than 0.32 metres .Earlier assessments based on coarser data had highlighted several candidate areas between 84° and 90° south latitude. The new work focused on five zones around Mons Mouton, analysing them with sharper OHRC stereo images at 32-centimetre resolution. One site was discarded because it lay in permanent shadow .Researchers generated digital elevation models at a fine grid of 0.32 metres and studied terrain undulations, illumination patterns and hazard distribution. Four locations, labelled MM-1, MM-3, MM-4 and MM-5, were compared on parameters such as mean slope, height range and the number of safe landing grids of 24 by 24 metres .Among them, the MM-4 area — at latitude minus 84.289° and longitude 32.808° — emerged as the front-runner. It showed the lowest hazard level at 9.89%, an average slope of 5° and the highest count of 568 safe grids. The region also offered favourable illumination and limited shadowing from nearby terrain .Other sites carried higher risks. MM-1 and MM-3 recorded hazard levels above 12%, while MM-5 provided only 72 safe grids within the target area. Elevations across the sites ranged from 4,800 to over 6,100 metres, reflecting the broken topography of the lunar south pole .Scientists say the analysis demonstrates how high-resolution imaging can guide precise landing decisions. The OHRC data allowed them to map craters, boulders and slopes with a clarity not available during earlier missions .If approved by the landing site selection committee, the MM-4 patch will host India’s first attempt to bring back pieces of the Moon. Success would place Isro among a small group of space agencies capable of returning extraterrestrial samples, opening a new chapter in the country’s planetary exploration programme.","Scientists from Isro ’s Space Applications Centre (SAC) have identified a promising landing zone in the rugged south polar region of the Moon for India’s first lunar sample return mission, Chandrayaan-4.

Elon Musk in the middle of a Bad Bunny and TPUSA Super Bowl clash

Super Bowl LX viewers who planned to stream Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show on X were met with an unexpected change just hours before kickoff. The alternative broadcast, promoted as a patriotic counterprogramming option during the NFL’s halftime spectacle, will no longer air on Elon Musk ’s platform. Organizers cited licensing complications as the reason behind the sudden pivot.The announcement came on Sunday, creating confusion among supporters who had prepared to watch the show through X. Instead, the group redirected its audience elsewhere, signaling that digital rights issues had forced a last minute decision.Turning Point USA addressed the situation directly in a public update. “UPDATE: Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to stream The All-American Halftime Show on X,” its post read. “Head on over to our YouTube channel tonight around 8 PM ET to watch the full show.”The group had marketed the production as a family friendly alternative to the NFL’s official halftime event featuring Bad Bunny. In earlier promotions, it described the program in strong terms: “The All-American Halftime Show will be a unique, patriotic event proudly celebrating American culture, freedom, and faith.”However, streaming rights often differ across platforms.Music and entertainment broadcasts require strict compliance with digital licensing agreements. X operates under a different copyright framework than YouTube, which offers broader infrastructure for handling licensed performances. Rather than risk a takedown or legal complications mid stream, organizers chose to move the entire broadcast to YouTube.Although certain content information was not revealed, the shift highlights the complicated environment of live event streaming on high profile events such as the Super Bowl. In real time platforms have to strike a balance between free speech, the expectations of the audience, and the copyright legislation.For viewers, the solution is simple. The show will still go on.

Oracle's Larry Ellison has lost almost $50 billion this year in less than forty days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracles-larry-ellison-has-lost-almost-50-billion-this-year-in-less-than-forty-days/articleshow/127967875.cms,"Ellison was not alone other tech leaders also hit hard

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Q: How can I start career cushioning?

Q: What are some examples of career cushioning?

Q: Is career cushioning only for people in certain industries?

Q: How often should I review and update my career cushioning efforts?

Q: How do I know if my career cushioning efforts are working?

Q: How much time should I be dedicating to career cushioning?

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X

What Elon Musk said about SpaceX deprioritizing Mars mission

""For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years.

The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars.

It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (2 day trip time). This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city.

That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.""

When Elon Musk proposed name for first city on Mars

Elon Musk-owned space company SpaceX is shifting its near-term focus away from Mars to prioritise building a self-sustaining city on the Moon. The update was shared by the tech billionaire in an X post citing faster timelines and easier launch opportunities. Sharing the post, Elon Musk said that a Moon city could be achieved in less than 10 years, while building a city on Mars would take more than two decades. While the Moon is now the top priority, Musk said SpaceX has not abandoned its Mars plans. “The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars,” Musk wrote on X.When asked by a user to clarify rumours of SpaceX deprioritizing Mars mission, the tech billionaire replied saying “Moon first”.Musk was responding to a post by Teslanomics that read:“Elon, there’s a lot of people saying SpaceX is deprioritizing Mars this Earth-Mars launch window and focusing on the moon instead. I don’t really trust this, unless I hear it from the source. Can you shed some insight on what the plan is? Thanks!”In an X post, Elon Musk wrote:Elon Musk has long talked about his plans to build a city on the red planet. So much so that he once proposed name for the first Martian city. “Elon Musk says the first city on Mars will be named ‘Terminus’,” an April 2025 post said on X.Replying to the post, Musk not only confirmed the name but also provided information on why he chose it, saying that it will ultimately depend on the residents of Mars to name their city.“It’s from Asimov’s Foundation. But I’m open to other ideas,” Musk said. “Ultimately, it will be up to the people of Mars to decide,” he added.","Elon Musk-owned space company SpaceX is shifting its near-term focus away from Mars to prioritise building a self-sustaining city on the Moon.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Read Tesla former AI director Andrej Karpathy’s complete post here

A lot of people quote tweeted this as 1 year anniversary of

vibe coding

. Some retrospective -

I've had a Twitter account for 17 years now (omg) and I still can't predict my tweet engagement basically at all. This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic ""contribution"" and even its article is longer.

lol

The one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite ""agentic engineering"":

- ""agentic"" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.

- ""engineering"" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.

In 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.

Former Tesla AI director and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy, who popularised the term vibe-coding has introduced a new phrase for the next stage of AI-driven software development: agentic engineering. While vibe-coding refers to humans prompting AI to write code, agentic engineering describes a process where AI agents themselves generate and refine code autonomously. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Karpathy explained that the tern reflects not only the role of agents in writing code but also the ‘art & science and expertise’ required to guide them effectively.Karpathy who now believes that the next phase of AI-assisted programming deserves its own name: agentic engineering. He feels that unlike vibe-coding, where humans prompt AI directly, agentic engineering includes AI agents autonomously wiring and refining code while humans act as orchestrators and supervisors.Karpathy explained:- “Agentic” because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.- “Engineering” to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it.It’s something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.Karpathy predicts that 2026 will bring continued improvements in both the model layer and the agent layer, making agentic engineering a central part of software development.","Former Tesla AI director and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy has introduced a new phrase for the next stage of AI-driven software development: agentic engineering.

Why fragrance matters more during Ramadan in the Gulf



Ramadan's Secret Weapon: How Gulf Men Are Using Scent to Make a Statement in 2026





As Ramadan 2026 settles in, scent is once again taking centre stage across the Gulf. Far beyond a grooming afterthought, fragrance during the holy month is a quiet marker of identity and are worn for evening prayers, family iftars and the social rhythms that lead into Eid. This year’s Arabic cologne trends reflect a deeper return to heritage notes, layered with modern sensibilities and long-lasting compositions designed for reflective nights and festive gatherings.Deep, smoky woods continue to dominate Ramadan fragrance preferences. Oud-inspired compositions that are rich, resinous and unapologetically bold, remain a cultural staple, particularly for evening wear. These scents often unfold slowly, starting dense and powerful before settling into warm, grounding bases that linger for hours.For many men, woody fragrances feel intrinsically tied to Ramadan nights as they are dignified, spiritual and deeply comforting. Their longevity makes them ideal for long taraweeh prayers and extended family gatherings, where subtle presence matters more than projection.Amber-forward fragrances are seeing renewed popularity this season, prized for their soft warmth and enveloping character. These colognes often blend sweet resins with balsamic undertones, creating a scent profile that feels intimate rather than overpowering.Perfect for Ramadan evenings, amber scents evoke a sense of calm and contemplation, aligning naturally with the month’s reflective mood. They are especially favoured by men who want something rich yet restrained, offering depth without heaviness.For those who prefer their fragrance to make a statement, spicy oriental profiles are trending strongly in 2026. Think warm spices layered over dark woods and subtle sweetness as fragrances that feel celebratory and confident.These colognes are often chosen for post-iftar socialising and Eid gatherings, where boldness feels appropriate. The spice notes add energy, while the oriental base ensures the scent remains grounded and culturally resonant.A newer category gaining traction blends freshness with traditional depth. These fragrances typically open with citrus or aromatic notes before transitioning into woody or musky bases. The result is a cleaner, lighter take on Arabic perfumery, which is ideal for daytime fasting hours or warmer evenings.This hybrid style appeals to younger wearers and those seeking versatility: fragrances that move seamlessly from mosque visits to casual gatherings without feeling too heavy.Musk-based colognes, often paired with soft leather nuances, are emerging as understated favourites this Ramadan. These scents sit closer to the skin, offering a personal rather than performative presence.Favoured for their elegance and restraint, musky profiles align well with the quieter, inward focus of the holy month. They are particularly popular among men who prefer a refined signature scent that does not announce itself loudly but leaves a lasting impression.Across categories, one theme is clear: performance and emotional resonance matter more than novelty.

Apps to boycott US goods gain traction amid Trump's threats to Greenland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/apps-to-boycott-us-goods-gain-traction-amid-trumps-threats-to-greenland/articleshow/128090506.cms,"EU's Huge Greenland Reveal After Trump Backs Off On Tariff Threat Over Invasion Protest





COPENHAGEN: The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the flare-up in tensions over President Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic crisis in late Jan out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March 2025.Rosenfeldt, who works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott US goods. ""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not. And if you don't know that, you can't make a conscious choice. ""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives. Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using AI, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the US to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela. ""It's become personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend."" Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the US economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of Feb. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany. ""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided. ""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. Sixty-three retiree Charlotte Fuglsang said, ""I love America, I love travelling in America. I don't think we should reegister protest that way.""","""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time.

Supply chain mechanics

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.

Shahi Tharoor’s thoughts on reading, children and AI





Dubai’s vibrant literary scene was abuzz recently as Shashi Tharoor , Indian politician, author and former diplomat, delivered a memorable session at the Emirates Literature Festival, one of the Middle East’s premier cultural events celebrating books, ideas and global literary voices. Held annually under the patronage of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and organised by the Emirates Literature Foundation, the festival draws hundreds of speakers and thousands of readers from around the world.The 2026 edition featured more than 200 speakers from over 40 countries, bringing a mix of fiction, non-fiction, Arabic literature, poetry, performance and discussion to Dubai audiences.Tharoor’s session, titled A Wonderland of Words, also the name of his latest book, quickly became a highlight of the festival. Unlike typical lectures, his appearance blended humour, personal anecdotes and linguistic insight in a talk that felt more like an intimate conversation than a formal presentation.Moderated by British presenter Amandeep Bhangu, the session focused on how language shapes thought, culture and connection, drawing laughter and reflection in equal measure. Tharoor described his book as a series of short, reflective bursts rather than dense arguments, “bite-sized chapters, ideal for dipping in and out”, a format that felt like a quiet validation of modern reading habits.However, the real charm of the session lay in how effortlessly he braided the personal with the public, tracing his lifelong love of language back to his father, who taught himself English through persistence and curiosity rather than polish. Arriving in London and recognising the limits of his learning, his father began filling notebooks with quotations from Byron, Shakespeare and Dickens, not to impress but out of sheer delight in words.He revealed that back home, language was treated like a game: Scrabble before it was fashionable, word-building challenges where Tharoor admitted he “usually won” and even a homemade, pre-digital precursor to Wordle that allowed 20 guesses and offered no clues. Yet beneath the playfulness of his father was emotional precision, a man who wrote letters so moving that people remembered them long after his passing, whether for moments of grief, joy or setback.From him, Tharoor learned that words are not decorative flourishes but exact instruments, a pleasure in themselves and powerful because of what they can carry.Tharoor traced his fascination with language to his father’s passionate approach to English, recalling how notebooks full of quotations and impromptu wordplay games shaped his early years. “You don’t really choose a language, a language chooses you through the circumstances of your life,” he told the audience, capturing the personal, almost serendipitous nature of linguistic affinity.He also tackled the stereotype of his own “difficult vocabulary,” underscoring that words should serve clarity and connection, not confusion. “I unfortunately have an undeserved reputation for difficult words. I use the most appropriate words for what I’m trying to convey. If I can’t convey my thoughts to the audience, I’m a poor communicator. I use language to get my message across, not to confuse or impress,” he said to applause.Tharoor’s playful side surfaced in anecdotes about English eccentricities, like explanations of humorous linguistic terms and the cultural quirks of borrowing words across languages. Dubai, a global crossroads where multilingual communication is part of daily life, provided a fitting backdrop for Tharoor’s reflections on language and identity.His remarks on how English interacts with other languages and cultural contexts resonated with an audience intimately familiar with linguistic blending across communities. Quoting Nelson Mandela’s famous insight that speaking in someone’s language reaches the mind, while speaking in their own language reaches the heart, Tharoor highlighted the emotional power embedded in words and communication.In a Q&A segment, Tharoor urged parents and readers to model lifelong reading for children, asking whether they read themselves before encouraging others to read. He also warned against over-reliance on artificial intelligence in writing, stressing that outsourcing thought can dilute individuality and creative voice.Tharoor’s session exemplified the broader ethos of the Emirates Literature Festival, a belief in the transformative power of books and discussion to spur curiosity, understanding and cross-cultural exchange. Each year, the festival brings a mix of authors, thinkers and artists to Dubai, offering everything from panels and workshops to performances and interactive discussions. Its inclusive programming has helped position the city as a major cultural hub in the region.Tharoor’s appearance in Dubai was more than a book talk; it was a reminder of language’s enduring influence in an era dominated by rapid communication, digital media and global diversity. In blending personal narrative, linguistic curiosity and cultural observation, he offered the audience both entertainment and reflection. These are the qualities that make literature festivals more than mere gatherings but platforms for collective imagination and dialogue.","Shashi Tharoor is an Indian politician, author and former diplomat.

Million-Dirham Decisions Made Simple: The Tool Luxury Buyers in Dubai Are Quietly Using

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally, drawing affluent local and international investors alike. However, while listing volumes are high, identifying the right inventory with real market value and credibility can still be challenging.With hundreds of luxury transactions recorded annually, including more than 750 properties above Dh50m and over 250 valued above Dh100m in 2025 alone, the challenge for affluent buyers is not just seeing inventory but identifying the right opportunities backed by real market behaviour. Platforms like Bayut are simplifying this process with data-led tools, verified listings and specialist agent networks designed to empower discerning buyers.Instead of simply providing endless listings, Bayut focuses on three core pillars of data insights, verified availability and expert partnerships to help buyers separate signal from noise in a dynamic market environment.One of the biggest challenges for luxury buyers is knowing whether a listed price reflects actual market activity rather than wishful thinking.Bayut tackles this by offering transaction-backed insights, drawing on official Dubai Land Department (DLD) records, so that buyers can see what similar properties are really achieving in terms of sales volume and pricing.In 2025, Dubai recorded thousands of high-value property sales, including more than 750 transactions for properties above Dh50 million and over 250 above Dh100 million, underscoring both demand and the need for accurate context. This type of benchmark pricing helps buyers understand if a property is competitively priced, overpriced, or a rare value play — a crucial step before making multi-million-dirham commitments.Luxury real estate is not just about price tags, it is about deep market knowledge, negotiation experience and access to exclusive opportunities. Bayut’s ecosystem highlights specialist agents with proven track records in high-value transactions, rather than generalists who may be active across all segments.Programs like TruBroker, Bayut’s quality standard for agent credibility, help buyers identify intermediaries who are consistent, data-savvy and focused on premium markets. This makes it easier to form partnerships with professionals who understand how to position offers, anticipate buyer preferences and secure coveted properties.Luxury inventory, especially at the very top end, can be distorted by outdated listings, duplicate posts or units that are no longer available. Bayut’s technology emphasises verified listings through tools like TruCheck and cross-referencing with systems like DLD’s Madmoun to ensure that a property you’re considering is truly active and not a relic of old marketing efforts.This verification helps buyers avoid wasted time and misaligned expectations, accelerating decision-making and reducing friction in negotiations.Luxury buyers also benefit from tools that help them evaluate whether asking prices make sense relative to market benchmarks. Bayut’s TruEstimate offers valuation estimates, historical price movement analysis and demand indicators that serve as a sense check for where a property stands, helping buyers discern possible overpricing or hidden opportunity without removing the emotional appeal of design or location.Such analytical signals are especially valuable in a segment where architectural uniqueness or waterfront views can command premium pricing that may not be immediately intuitive.High-end property purchases often emerge from long-term observation rather than last-minute decisions. Features like portfolio tracking (where buyers can keep an eye on pricing trends, status shifts and comparisons across multiple shortlisted properties), give investors a structured way to monitor the market over time, rather than making impulsive choices.This kind of forward-looking visibility keeps serious buyers informed about pricing shifts, new inventory that enters the high-end space, and when timing might be right to make a move. As Dubai continues to attract wealthy buyers from Europe, Asia and the Gulf with significant activity in places like Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate and Mohammed Bin Rashid City, the need for clarity and confidence in property selection has never been greater.Bayut’s combination of transaction-backed data, verification, specialist networks and valuation insights positions it not just as a listing portal but as a trusted guide through one of the world’s most dynamic luxury markets. In an era where information overload can mislead as easily as it informs, access to accurate data, specialised expertise and transparent tools helps buyers make smarter and more efficient decisions, whether they are picking a trophy asset or a strategic long-term investment.","Dubai’s ultra-luxury property segment, including homes priced above Dh20 million, remains one of the hottest real estate markets globally.

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled.

""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February.

""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods.

How geography shapes Australia’s extreme landscapes



Australia’s unusual mix of deserts and rainforests side by side







Our planet is more unpredictable and more fascinating than most of us imagine. Most countries have one dominant climate, which is maybe a hot desert or a wet rainforest. Australia breaks that rule completely. Travel a few hundred kilometres, and you could step from sun-baked dunes straight into dense, dripping forest. The country manages extremes like few others on Earth. From the parched interior to the lush northeast, Australia is a place of dramatic contrasts. Experts say its size, latitude, and unique weather systems make it possible. It’s not just a scenic quirk. It tells a story about geography, climate, and life adapting in extreme ways. For travellers, it feels like seeing two completely different planets in one.The country’s unusual geography is the main reason. A large central landmass sits under high-pressure zones. Rain can barely reach it. That’s why deserts dominate the interior. Meanwhile, moist winds blow in from the Pacific Ocean. They hit the northeast and dump heavy rainfall. Tropical rainforests can survive right alongside some of the driest deserts on Earth.Experts say it’s a rare combination and you don’t see it anywhere else at this scale.Nearly a third of the continent is desert or semi-arid. Regions like the Great Victoria, Great Sandy, Simpson, and Tanami deserts are legendary. Temperatures swing. Rainfall is almost non-existent. Life here is tough, but it persists. Plants dig deep roots, some store water, and animals hide during the day and become active at night. Heat-resistant species roam freely. It seems the desert is harsh, but it’s also full of life, quietly thriving against the odds.Up north, in Queensland and northern New South Wales, rainforests thrive. The Daintree Rainforest is the most famous. It’s reportedly over 180 million years old. That makes it one of the world's oldest surviving tropical rainforests. Plants, insects, birds, and mammals exist here that you can’t find anywhere else. Heavy rainfall and fertile soil keep it alive. Warm temperatures help too. It seems like a miracle that this greenery can survive so close to deserts. But nature balances itself strangely well.It seems improbable, yet deserts and rainforests exist within the same nation. Coastal rainfall nourishes rainforests. Inland winds keep deserts dry. Fertile soil supports life, where it falls, high-pressure zones block moisture where it’s not needed. The balance allows both ecosystems to coexist. Experts say it’s an environmental oddity, a demonstration of how climate and geography interact in extreme ways.Australia’s incredible diversity: From deserts to rainforests and coral reefsDeserts and rainforests are just the start. Australia also has savannas, mountains, wetlands, rivers, beaches, and coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef lies near tropical rainforests, which is the world’s largest coral reef system. Few countries have such a variety packed into one continent. About 70 percent of the land is arid or semi-arid. Yet ecosystems flourish everywhere. It seems like an impossible puzzle of nature, but it works.Australia stands as one of the most ecologically varied and scientifically significant countries on Earth. For travellers, scientists, and nature lovers, it’s a place full of surprises.","Australia is one of the most ecologically varied and scientifically significant countries on Earth.

Rune stones reveal hidden human emotions



How Rune stones preserve Viking life, loss, and legacy



Mystery of the Rök stone puzzle







Across Sweden, ancient rune stones stand quietly in fields, near churches, and along roads. Many people pass them without a second thought. Yet these stones hold voices from more than 1,000 years ago. Messages carved by Vikings still speak about love, grief, pride, and everyday life. Experts say new rune discoveries still happen today, often when farmers plough land or construction workers dig foundations. It seems these stones were never meant to disappear. They were public memorials, designed to be seen and remembered.Strangely, these stones act like ancient social media posts, sharing personal messages meant to last forever, across generations, cultures, and historical memory.Rune grey stones with sharp carved lines might look plain at first. Nothing emotional on the surface. As reported by BBC, one famous Viking-era message, found on a textile tool near Gothenburg, reportedly reads: “Do you think of me, I think of you, do you love me, I love you.” It sounds almost like a modern text message between partners.Runes were carved on wood, bone, tools, and cloth. But stone lasted the longest. Many were memorial stones, placed near roads or meeting places so travellers would see them.It appears paying for a rune stone was expensive. And historians think these stones also showed wealth and social status, not just memory.Researchers believe runic writing started around 2,000 years ago. Northern Europeans might have seen Roman or Latin writing while travelling and then adapted those ideas into their own alphabet. Early rune systems used about 24 letters.Rune stones became especially common during the Viking Age, roughly between 800 and 1050 AD. Today, experts say around 7,000 rune inscriptions exist worldwide.Families often raised them to honour loved ones. One stone describes a wife as an excellent housekeeper and sister. Another remembers a son who died during a Viking raid. Some even mention betrayal or disputes over land inheritance. One can almost feel the emotions behind the carvings.One Viking named Jarlabanke reportedly raised several stones praising himself while still alive. He even claimed full ownership of certain lands. Experts say rune stones help historians understand daily Viking life and not just warfare.The Rök rune stone in Sweden remains one of the biggest puzzles. It contains the longest known runic text and was created in the 9th century. For many years, scholars believed it described heroic legends and ancient kings.Researchers believe it could reference a period of extreme cold caused by volcanic eruptions centuries earlier. Some scholars even think the stone’s carvings might align with stars or the sun during seasonal events. If true, the stone might have been part message, part cosmic riddle.Today, rune symbols sometimes appear in art and online quizzes. People even find “birth runes” for fun.","Runes were carved on wood, bone, tools, and cloth. Many were memorial stones, placed near roads or meeting places so travellers would see them.

Mizkif-linked Twitch account receives temporary suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/mizkif-linked-twitch-account-receives-temporary-suspension/articleshow/128083663.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Twitch suspends Mizkif-linked account over competitor promotion





The Twitch account of a popular streamer, Mizkif, was suspended for a brief period of time, specifically for 24 hours. The suspension of the user was minor, specifically for a different account of Mizkif, which was not his main Twitch channel. In other words, his main channel was not suspended. The suspension was marked as temporary, indicating that there was a relatively minor offense or violation. The account of Mizkif was suspended for a full day until it was later made active again, leading to public speculations about the reason for suspension.This type of short suspension is sometimes utilized by Twitch if the rule infringement was minor and the first of its kind. In this instance, it was an indicator of the tight rules governing how streamers utilize the very visible aspects of their platforms. Although it was a short suspension, it served to show the streamers the level of consideration the platform had regarding the channel’s content.According to reports, the suspension was triggered because a Kick link appeared in the stream’s title. Twitch considers titles as high-visibility space since they appear in search results, recommendations, and category listings.Using a title to direct viewers to a competing platform violates Twitch’s rules because it uses Twitch’s own discovery system to funnel traffic elsewhere.Although Twitch does allow users to link to their other accounts in specific situations, such as in social media icons or channel descriptions, it enforces a blanket policy when dealing with titles, messages, or screen overlays. In this way, it is clear that Twitch takes the process of trying to redirect users from the platform very seriously, even for secondary accounts.One would also want to mention that, technically, the 24 hours of suspension have been of a symbolic character. The reason for this is that Mizkif continues live streaming on other sites, which include Kick, with no issues.Overall, the incident is an important reminder for streamers to be mindful of their promotion of other platforms. While small actions in prominent areas have serious consequences, the incident was not significant for Mizkif, and the account was restored within a day to ensure minimum disruption.","Twitch suspends Mizkif-linked account over competitor promotion.

Dubai’s iconic coastline is undergoing one of its most ambitious transformations in years, with major beach development projects already underway and more planned through the Blue and Green Spaces 2030 Roadmap unveiled at the World Governments Summit 2026. These changes are set to reshape how residents and tourists experience Dubai’s shores, from innovative night swimming options and panoramic ocean views to entirely new “all-season” beach destinations.At the heart of this coastal evolution is Dubai Municipality’s master plan to increase public beach length from roughly 21 km to 105 km, expand facilities by up to 400% and boost recreational infrastructure, all aligned with the emirate’s broader urban lifestyle and tourism strategy.One of the most eagerly awaited upgrades is at Jumeirah Beach 1, where redevelopment is now nearly complete and official opening is expected imminently. The project has expanded the beach by about 50% and integrates new cycling, jogging and pedestrian paths alongside modern amenities such as smart lockers, Wi-Fi, AI-enhanced safety systems and climate-resilient design features.These enhancements aim not only to support active lifestyles but also to future-proof the beach against environmental pressures, with significant sand nourishment and coastal protection measures engineered into the master plan.Another major pillar of Dubai’s seaside reinvention is Al Mamzar Beach Corniche. Part of a Dh355 million redevelopment programme, the corniche will feature a 200-metre floating pedestrian bridge, the first of its kind in Dubai, connecting both sides of the beach and offering new waterfront perspectives and viewing points.The project also expands walking, running and cycling tracks, enhances public services and includes dedicated areas for active recreation, leisure dining and wellness. A 125,000 sqm women-only beach area with secure entry and tailored amenities, including children’s play zones and night swimming opportunities, will also be introduced.Night swimming has already proven wildly popular at existing beaches such as Jumeirah 2, Jumeirah 3 and Umm Suqeim 1, collectively drawing roughly 1.5 million visitors in 18 months, indicating strong public appetite for round-the-clock coastal leisure.In early February 2026, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council approved a Dh500 million master plan to transform Umm Suqeim Beach, which currently spans about 3.1 km. The redevelopment seeks to elevate the area into a year-round destination that combines urban beach life with broader tourism appeal, aiming to welcome up to 6 million visitors annually.The comprehensive project includes infrastructure upgrades, expanded parking, smart lighting for night use and integrated transport hubs, all designed to make the beach more accessible, vibrant and enjoyable. Covering nearly 445,000 square metres, the project will expand the usable beach area by around 30%.A strong focus on accessibility and safety underpins the upgrade. Smart lighting will be installed across 130,000 square metres, allowing for safer evening and night-time use. Parking capacity will increase by 200% to approximately 2,400 spaces, alongside improved road access. Connectivity across the site will be enhanced through 10 mobility hubs and 11 dedicated taxi pick-up and drop-off points, while new cycling tracks, electric vehicle facilities and scooter infrastructure will encourage sustainable transport.Dubai’s beach transformation does not stop at the sea. A new artificial “mountain beach” project in Hatta will feature a Crystal Lagoon and waterfront amenities within the mountainous landscape, bringing a unique beach experience far from the Gulf shore. This destination, complete with walking paths, cycling trails, water sports zones, dining spots and even outdoor cinemas, aims to redefine what beach tourism can look like in Dubai’s varied terrain.One of the project’s standout features is a 38-metre observation tower, inspired by Dubai’s maritime heritage. Designed as a visual landmark, the tower will offer panoramic views of the coastline, adding a new experiential highlight to the beach.Technology and sustainability are central to the redevelopment. AI-powered monitoring and operational systems will improve safety and operational efficiency, while engineering measures such as retaining walls and elevated beach levels have been incorporated to address sea-level rise. Sustainable design principles are woven throughout the public spaces, reinforcing Dubai’s long-term vision for resilient and future-ready coastal destinations.Across all projects, Dubai’s beach strategy prioritises accessibility, inclusivity and smart technology:Many of these enhancements align with Dubai’s long-term plans to elevate quality of life, boost tourism and create coastal public spaces that rival global beach destinations. The coming years will see Dubai’s beaches evolve from simple seaside escape routes into multi-faceted public destinations that blend lifestyle, technology, inclusivity and sustainability.Whether it is the expanded Jumeirah Beach 1, the connected Al Mamzar Corniche with its floating bridge, the mammoth Umm Suqeim makeover or the innovative mountain-lagoon scene in Hatta, Dubai is redefining what a beach experience can look like in the 21st century. With more space, new services and night-long leisure options, the emirate’s coastline is poised to become an even greater magnet for residents, tourists and global visitors, a continuous celebration of sun, sea and urban life.","Dubai’s iconic coastline is undergoing one of its most ambitious transformations in years.

How the service works





Why it matters









The UAE has rolled out a new public-facing security reporting service, giving residents a direct and confidential way to alert authorities to potential threats, as the State Security Department strengthens its preventive security framework.The UAE State Security Department has launched the “SSD” service, a dedicated channel that allows members of the public to report security-related concerns that could affect public safety and social stability. The initiative is designed to support faster responses, improve the efficiency of preventive security operations, and reinforce the national security system.Authorities say the service is rooted in the belief that security is a shared responsibility. Public awareness and participation are viewed as the first line of defence against potential threats. By opening a direct line of communication, the department aims to encourage individuals to take an active role in protecting national achievements and maintaining a safe and stable society.The SSD service receives reports covering a wide range of security issues. These include extremist activity, suspicious behaviour, threats to community security and individual safety, insults to the state and its symbols, information leaks, espionage, and other actions or observations that may impact social stability.Reports can be submitted through a toll-free number, 800 6600, which provides a fast and direct way for the public to share security-related information. The department has emphasised that all reports are handled with strict confidentiality. The identity of the reporter is not disclosed, and the highest standards of privacy and data protection are applied, allowing individuals to share information freely and without concern.Officials say the service is intended to strengthen community partnership and build trust between the public and security institutions. By enabling early reporting, authorities aim to prevent risks before they escalate and to preserve social peace.The launch of the SSD service also coincides with the verification of the State Security Department’s official account on the X platform. The account is positioned as an interactive channel to raise security awareness, share accurate information and alerts, and encourage constructive engagement with the public in support of national security and stability.","The UAE State Security Department has launched the ‘SSD’ service, a dedicated channel that allows members of the public to report security-related concerns.

Weather in UAE today





Early morning alert

Why this weather pattern?





Dubai and parts of the UAE are under a weather pattern that brings light rain and cloudy skies, especially in the early hours of the morning. Local forecasters including the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) have forecast light rainfall on Friday, February 6, 2026, with some coastal and inland areas seeing droplets or short showers.This comes as part of a broader unstable weather system, influenced by shifts in pressure and cloud cover building over the region, which increases the chance of rain, especially in northern and eastern parts of the UAE.Today’s daytime conditions in Dubai are expected to be fair to partly cloudy, with a pleasant high of around 26 °C and a low at night near 17–18 °C.As night approaches, humidity levels will rise, particularly over coastal areas and islands. This overnight increase in moisture raises the likelihood of fog or mist formation, which can make early morning visibility challenging for drivers and pedestrians.Winds will be light to moderate, generally from southeasterly to northeasterly directions at around 10–20 km/hr, with occasional gusts reaching up to about 30 km/hr, which might stir patches of moisture and keep the skies feeling cool and breezy.According to the latest satellite imagery from the NCM, the most consistent rainfall is predicted for Dubai, Sharjah, and Ajman.However, the ""heavy hitters"" are expected in the mountainous regions of Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, where the terrain naturally pushes clouds higher, leading to more concentrated downpours.In Dubai, the rain is likely to be ""intermittent,"" meaning you might experience a quick burst of heavy rain followed by a lull. For those in Abu Dhabi, the weather will remain mostly cloudy with a lower chance of direct rainfall compared to their northern neighbors.One of the biggest weather talking points for today is visibility concerns early in the morning. Because of increased humidity and the cooler night temperatures, the NCM predicts fog or mist formation across parts of Dubai and neighbouring emirates, especially in areas near the coast and low-lying districts.This morning fog could affect traffic visibility on major roads, so authorities and media outlets are advising residents to drive with caution, reduce speeds, and use headlights in foggy conditions.The recent forecasts from weather news services and the NCM highlight a trend that has been developing since earlier this week: spells of partly cloudy weather with intermittent rain chances and increasing humidity at night.Across the UAE, cloud cover has increased, bringing lighter showers and thicker skies over inland and some northern regions. This pattern is typical for the winter transition period, where moisture and temperature fluctuations make rain and fog more likely than in drier seasons.Meteorologists note that while the rain today is unlikely to be heavy, the combination of clouds, occasional showers and fog will shape the weather through today and into the weekend, so residents should stay informed through official bulletins.","Dubai and parts of the UAE are under a weather pattern that brings light rain and cloudy skies.

How job scams are evolving in the Gulf: AI and bots



Official advice: How to protect yourself against job scams in the Gulf



Verify every job offer:



Use the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) platforms to confirm a job offer’s validity. For work visas, use official government channels like GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) or ICP’s eChannels in the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, check with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) or relevant Saudi government recruitment verification systems.

Never pay fees to recruiters



Check the company’s legitimacy



Use official communication channels



Retain records



What to do if you encounter a job scam in the Gulf



Stop all communication immediately.

Report the scam to local authorities such as Dubai Police’s eCrime platform or the relevant law enforcement agency in your area.

Contact your embassy or consulate for help verifying job offers from abroad.

Share warnings with friends and networks to prevent others from falling victim.

Most companies today don’t post jobs to hire.

They post jobs to collect data and train their AI.

As the Gulf continues to attract millions of job seekers, from local professionals to expatriates and international applicants, fraudulent job offers and fake recruitment schemes have become a persistent problem in the UAE and Saudi Arabia . These scams have grown more sophisticated, leveraging social media, messaging apps and even AI-powered bots to deceive applicants into losing money or exposing their personal information.Sweat not as we spill the beans on how these scams work, what the authorities are warning about and the practical steps you can take to stay safe.Dubai, Abu Dhabi in the UAE and other Gulf cities including Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, are magnets for global talent because of their diverse economies and high demand for skilled workers. Unfortunately, fraudsters exploit this demand by posting fake job ads that promise high salaries, minimal experience requirements and even immediate work visas.These tactics can trap unsuspecting applicants into giving up money, documents or personal data without ever receiving a legitimate job offer. Authorities have noted that the scammers use a wide range of channels, from social media and job boards to WhatsApp, Telegram and email, to make their offers look official, often using real company names or logos to lend credibility.Understanding common warning signs is one of the best defenses against job scams. Experts and police advisories in the UAE emphasise the following red flags -Recent reports highlight that fraudsters are increasingly using AI-powered bots to automate the creation of thousands of fake listings that look legitimate at first glance.These bots can even carry out simple “interviews” via automated chat before handing applicants over to human fraudsters. This makes spotting scams even harder without careful verification.Authorities in Dubai and across the UAE have issued clear guidance to job seekers on how to stay safe -Genuine employers cover visa processing and recruitment costs; if you are asked to pay any charges, it is likely a scam.Research the company’s name, trade licence information and official website. Using official registries like the UAE’s National Economic Register can help confirm legitimacy.Always prefer communication via official email addresses or company phone numbers listed on corporate websites — and avoid ad hoc WhatsApp or social media chats.Keep all correspondence, offer letters, screenshots and names in case you need to report or investigate suspicious activity.If you suspect a job offer or agent is fake:Police and labour authorities are actively cracking down on fraud; in fact, over 1,300 companies were fined AED 34 million for fake job practices in 2025 as part of a broader enforcement effort. Job scams in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, from fake offers to fraudulent visa promises, pose real risks to job seekers. With fraudsters becoming more sophisticated and using tactics like AI bots and social media deception, it is more important than ever to stay vigilant.By learning the warning signs, verifying offers through official channels and never paying upfront fees, applicants can protect themselves and make informed career decisions in one of the Gulf’s most competitive job markets.","Job scams have become a persistent problem in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Kuwait Prepares 1,700 Mosques for Ramadan 2026: Safety, Comfort and Community Focus

In the UAE, preparations at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre include expanded parking and transport services ahead of Ramadan to serve millions of visitors.

In Saudi Arabia , ministries issue pre-Ramadan guidelines to ensure mosques and prayer halls nationwide are ready and staffed throughout the month.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches, Kuwait is entering a phase of intense preparation, not only spiritually but also logistically to ensure that Muslim worshippers can observe prayers comfortably and safely. Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs has announced that around 1,700 mosques across the country’s six governorates are being readied to welcome congregations for Taraweeh (night prayers) and other Ramadan rites.The Islamic month of Ramadan is woven into social and community life in Kuwait and governments are mobilising resources to uphold religious traditions while prioritising public safety and convenience. According to reports, the Ministry is finalising maintenance and service work at nearly 1,700 mosques to ensure they are fully equipped for the influx of worshippers during Ramadan. The work includes:Maintenance teams will be on duty around the clock throughout Ramadan this year, to address issues immediately and ensure mosques remain accessible and comfortable for all worshippers.Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs is not just preparing physical spaces, it is also working in tandem with other government bodies to provide a holistic experience for worshippers during the holy month:These measures reflect a growing emphasis on not just welcoming worshippers but also ensuring their well-being and dignity during intense spiritual practice, particularly in high-capacity mosques during Taraweeh and Laylat al-Qadr.Ramadan is much more than fasting from dawn to sunset. It is a month of communal gathering, prayer, reflection and charity. Mosques become epicenters of social and spiritual life, hosting night prayers, Quran recitations, charitable distribution and community iftars. The prep work underway in Kuwait underscores the importance of mosques as community anchors.Clean, safe, well-organised prayer spaces boost participation in congregational prayers, especially for elders and families and make it easier for people across age groups to engage in the spiritual rhythm of Ramadan. Kuwait is not alone in ramping up preparations for Ramadan worshippers. Across the Gulf, ministries and religious affairs departments are undertaking similar efforts.These coordinated activities reflect a shared regional priority of preserving Ramadan as a deeply religious, safe and communal experience for all Muslims. With the month of Ramadan nearly upon the region, Kuwait’s extensive preparations of covering 1,700 mosques, safety planning, infrastructure servicing and cross-agency coordination are setting the stage for a spiritually rich and orderly observance. These efforts demonstrate how government planning and community engagement come together to support traditions that are central to cultural and religious life during the holy month.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Islamic Affairs is finalising maintenance and service work at nearly 1,700 mosques to ensure they are fully equipped for the influx of worshippers during Ramadan. The work includes:Maintenance teams on duty around the clock throughout Ramadan this year, to address issues immediately and ensure mosques remain accessible and comfortable for all worshippers. Emergency medical services ready at central prayer hubs.Traffic regulation around large mosques to prevent congestion and enhance commuter safety.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127901806,imgsize-26748,width-400,resizemode-4/kuwait-gears-up-for-ramadan-1700-mosques-prepared-to-welcome-worshippers.jpg"
Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

“You might even consider a battery-powered radio, to keep on top of local updates if you can’t use your mobile.”





The Met Office has issued a series of weather warnings covering snow, rain and wind from late Monday through Tuesday. These include a 17-hour yellow warning for rain and snow from midnight Tuesday until 5pm, an amber warning for wind in eastern Northern Ireland, and an amber warning for rain across parts of south-west England.Explaining the risk in the south of England, the Met Office said:In northern England and Scotland, snow rather than rain is the main concern. The Met Office warned:In a broader briefing on the storm, the Met Office said Storm Chandra will bring “a further spell of wet and windy conditions later Monday and into Tuesday”, with gusty winds initially affecting the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and south-west Wales before moving north through the Irish Sea.An amber warning for wind has been issued for eastern Northern Ireland, where gusts of 60–70mph are expected widely, with up to 75mph possible in coastal areas. Heavy rain falling on already saturated ground in south Devon, Dorset, southern Somerset and south-east Cornwall could lead to flooding, while colder air further north will turn precipitation into hill snow across northern England and Scotland.Met Office Chief Forecaster Paul Gundersen said:With the risk of power cuts rising during periods of severe weather, energy firm British Gas has urged households to make sure they have three key items readily available.British Gas added:While additional supplies such as non-perishable food and blankets can be useful, the focus of the advice is on lighting, communication and access to information during potential power disruptions as Storm Chandra moves across the UK.","UK households urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD.

Growing concern over burnout in AI startups

Garry Tan, one of America’s biggest venture capitalists has warned startup founders against celebrating extreme work habits. “This is unhealthy by the way (speaking from experience). Try to get at least 6 hours of sleep per night when deeply addicted to Claude Code,” Tan wrote in an X post, responding to a tech founder who publicly boasted that his chief technology officer had not slept for more than a day while building new AI features. Claude Code is Anthropic's 2025-launched AI tool which is designed to help developers write, understand, and modify software faster. It works like an AI coding partner that can accelerate prototyping by 10x via collaborative AI agents, as shown in recent benchmarks compiling a full C compiler in weeks.The conversation started when Alistair McLeay, co-founder and co-CEO of AI startup Grw AI recently shared a post where he wrote: “Our CTO hasn’t slept in 36 hours because he’s been obsessively and single-handedly building massive new features with Claude Code’s Agent Teams.”“I genuinely think this might be the biggest paradigm shift in how fast you can build since Claude Code first came out last year,” he added.The exchange highlights a wider debate in the AI industry, where new tools are speeding up development but also encouraging round-the-clock work.While founders often share stories of extreme effort to signal progress, investors and operators are increasingly speaking about burnout, health risks, and long-term sustainability.Replying to the post, one user said “the 3am 'just one more prompt' loop is real. worst part is the agent keeps shipping while you're falling asleep at the keyboard. at least with manual coding you'd naturally stop when you got tired”.“I’ve been thinking about what makes these tools so addictive. I think the answer is variable ratio reinforcement reward. You’re always at the 90% mark of building something truly incredible and you have no idea how long it’ll take for the last 10% to wrap up,” said another user.“Been there. The trap is the dopamine loop of “one more run” in the terminal, so you never actually close the day. 6 hours + a hard stop is the difference between shipping tomorrow and debugging ghosts tonight,” replied a third.","Garry Tan, one of America’s biggest venture capitalists has warned startup founders against celebrating extreme work habits. “This is unhealthy by the way (speaking from experience).

Nominee vs legal heir: What is the difference and who has claim on assets? All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/faq/nominee-vs-legal-heir-what-is-the-difference-and-who-has-claim-on-assets-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125130453.cms,"AI image

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.
