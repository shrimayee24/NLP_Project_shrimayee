""Most people look for their dream career in the wrong place.

Here’s where you should actually start:

I was watching Sam Altman’s video and he said:

Forget passion.

Forget psychometric career tests.

Forget experience too.

Ask yourself: What is difficult for others, but easy for you?

What is that thing which takes people two hours, but you can do in ten minutes?

That’s your superpower.

Your unfair advantage.

And it’s often hiding in plain sight.

The skill you don’t even realise is rare, because it feels so easy to you!

What is that skill, for you?

The Indian Violet Tarantula, Chilobrachys fimbriatus, is among India’s most captivating and enigmatic spiders. Famous for its shimmering violet-blue legs and iridescent carapace, it is a striking example of the country’s rich biodiversity. Native to the Western Ghats, this tarantula thrives in humid forests and scrublands, where it constructs deep, silk-lined burrows for protection from predators and environmental extremes. Primarily nocturnal and fossorial, it spends most of its life hidden underground, emerging at night to hunt insects and small vertebrates with speed and precision. Despite its alluring appearance, it remains elusive, relying on stealth, agility, and defensive behaviours to survive. Its secretive lifestyle and dazzling colours make it one of India’s most remarkable arachnids.Belonging to the Theraphosidae family, the Indian Violet Tarantula stands out for its size and colouration. Females have a broad carapace with copper or golden tones and legs that glimmer in violet or blue under certain lighting conditions. These vivid hues are not from pigments but from microscopic structures on their hairs that reflect light, giving them a metallic, iridescent glow.The abdomen often shows reddish-brown patterns, adding to the spider’s striking appearance.This species is native to India’s Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage site celebrated for its dense rainforests and remarkable wildlife diversity. The Indian Violet Tarantula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, grasslands, and scrublands. It prefers soft, damp soil where it can dig deep burrows that maintain stable humidity and temperature levels. These underground shelters protect it from predators and harsh weather, allowing it to live comfortably in an environment that many species find challenging.The Indian Violet Tarantula is a fossorial species, meaning it spends most of its life underground. Its burrows are carefully engineered silk-lined tunnels that may extend several inches deep, with walls reinforced for stability. At the entrance, it often weaves delicate silk trip-lines that act like alarm systems. These threads detect the vibrations of approaching insects or predators, alerting the spider instantly. Because it rarely leaves its burrow during the day, it is often overlooked even in regions where it is abundant.The vibrant violet sheen seen on this species’ legs and body is caused by structural colouration; the reflection and scattering of light by nanoscale structures in the exoskeleton. Unlike pigmentation, which fades over time, structural colour creates a shimmering effect that changes with the viewing angle and lighting. This optical phenomenon gives the Indian Violet its unique and captivating appearance, often making it look like a living jewel on the forest floor.An efficient ambush predator, the Indian Violet Tarantula primarily feeds on insects like crickets, beetles, and roaches. Larger adults can capture small vertebrates, including lizards and frogs. It hunts mainly at night, waiting at the mouth of its burrow for unsuspecting prey. When movement is detected, it lunges forward with lightning speed, using its powerful fangs to inject venom that immobilises the target instantly. The spider then secretes digestive enzymes to liquefy the prey’s tissues before consuming the meal.Despite its intimidating appearance, the Indian Violet Tarantula is not naturally aggressive. When threatened, it prefers to retreat into its burrow rather than attack. However, if cornered, it may rear up and expose its fangs in a defensive posture. Bites are rare but can occur if provoked. The venom is not fatal to humans, though it causes severe local pain, redness, and swelling lasting several hours. For safety and respect, these spiders are best observed from a distance rather than handled. Like many tarantula species, females of the Indian Violet live significantly longer than males. Females can survive for over fifteen years, while males usually die shortly after mating, often within two to three years. This long lifespan and vibrant colouration make females especially prized among arachnid enthusiasts. Their longevity also plays an essential role in maintaining population stability, as each female can produce multiple egg sacs throughout her lifetime.Mating among Indian Violet Tarantulas is a cautious and dangerous ritual. The male approaches the female’s burrow and taps gently on her silk webbing to announce his presence. If she is receptive, mating proceeds peacefully, but if not, the encounter can turn fatal — the female may attack or even eat the male. After successful mating, the female lays her eggs inside the burrow and guards them diligently until they hatch into spiderlings. Once mature enough, the young disperse to dig their own burrows nearby.The Indian Violet Tarantula plays a vital role in its ecosystem as a natural pest controller. By preying on insects and small animals, it helps regulate population levels and maintain ecological balance. As a mid-level predator, it also serves as prey for larger animals such as birds, reptiles, and mammals, contributing to the complex food web of the Western Ghats forests.Because of its beauty, the Indian Violet Tarantula has gained popularity in the exotic pet trade. While captive-bred individuals are available, wild collection remains a problem. Overharvesting can damage local populations, especially since these spiders have low reproductive rates and limited dispersal. Responsible enthusiasts are encouraged to purchase only captive-bred specimens and support ethical breeding practices to reduce pressure on wild populations.The survival of the Indian Violet Tarantula is closely tied to the health of its native habitat. Deforestation, agricultural expansion, and rapid urbanisation are leading causes of habitat loss in the Western Ghats. As forest cover diminishes, suitable burrowing grounds are lost, fragmenting spider populations. Protecting this region’s soil structure and microhabitats is crucial, not only for the Indian Violet but for countless other species that depend on this unique ecosystem.","The Indian Violet Tarantula, Chilobrachys fimbriatus, is among India’s most captivating and enigmatic spiders.

Rare Video Of Louvre Heist: Watch Thieves Flee Calmly After Robbing France's €88 Mn Royal Treasure

When something needs to be done quickly

From shock to social media glory

The poetry of efficiency

Cultural burglary at its finest





There’s something absurdly European about a crime where the French lose their jewels and the Germans gain a marketing slogan.Last Sunday, thieves carried out a four-minute daylight heist at the Louvre, the kind of operation that would’ve made Danny Ocean blush. They rolled up in a truck, deployed a German-made Böcker Agilo freight lift, scaled the museum’s façade, smashed their way into a gallery, and disappeared on motorbikes through the Parisian maze.The French police are still looking for suspects. The internet, however, has already found its protagonist — the lift.The Agilo, built by the family-owned firm Böcker Maschinenwerke GmbH in North Rhine-Westphalia, wasn’t designed for criminal brilliance. It’s meant for construction sites and furniture removal — the kind of lift you hire when you’re moving apartments, not stealing history.But once photos of the Böcker machine parked outside the Louvre went viral, the company did what any self-respecting German manufacturer would do: turned mortification into marketing. By Monday, they had posted a picture of the lift online with the caption, “When something needs to be done quickly,” cheekily touting its ability to carry 400 kilograms of “treasures” at 42 metres per minute.The internet lapped it up.It was industrial poetry — the sort that could only come from a nation that treats punctuality as religion and engineering as art.Alexander Böcker, the company’s third-generation managing director, admitted he was initially “shocked” when he saw the images. But, as he told the Associated Press, once the disbelief faded, “black humour took over.”By then, the memes had already begun: clips of the Agilo rising along the Louvre façade cut to the Mission: Impossible theme, fan accounts christening it “The Louvre Express,” and tweets declaring that Germany had finally conquered Paris — one lift at a time.For the French, it was humiliation wrapped in irony. For Böcker, it was the kind of global attention that no ad agency could buy.The contrast could not be sharper. France, home to romance, art, and a lingering nostalgia for empire, undone by a German machine designed to move drywall. A nation of philosophy defeated by a company whose core value is “precision lifting since 1958.”Even Böcker’s marketing post had the politeness of a corporate memo and the punchline of a stand-up comic. It didn’t brag. It didn’t gloat. It simply existed — much like German humour itself: dry, literal, and devastatingly efficient.Of course, Böcker clarified that the Agilo isn’t certified to carry humans. It’s a freight lift. Furniture, yes. Thieves, no. The AP turned that disclaimer into an editorial mic drop.Somewhere in all this, the actual stolen Napoleonic jewels became a subplot. The memes had won. The Germans had turned a French embarrassment into a case study in brand virality. And Böcker Maschinenwerke, once known only to builders and movers, had ascended into pop-culture stardom.For a continent that can’t decide whether it wants to laugh, cry, or nationalise its humour, the Louvre heist became the perfect symbol of modern Europe: the French supply the drama, the Germans supply the tools, and the internet supplies the applause.And just like that, art was stolen, pride was dented, and a freight lift became a legend — proving once again that in Europe, efficiency will always find a way.","Thieves carried out a four-minute daylight heist at the Louvre on Sunday.

Earth to Eve Verses attack Trump and allies

Social media launch and ripple effect





young artist Earth to Eve has just released a provocative new track and accompanying Instagram reel that targets US President Donald Trump and his network. The song opens with a verse referencing Trump’s past social ties to Jeffrey Epstein , moves on to highlight his closeness with Elon Musk , then shifts to address lesser-known players like Stephen Miller. In the final bars, she calls out figures like JD Vance, Kristi Noem and Steve Bannon as the “sycophants” enabling this power structure. She also points to recent polling showing Trump’s approval sliding in key swing states — suggesting the crowd is coming home and the kingdom is waning.In her first verse, Earth to Eve uses vivid imagery to allude to Donald Trump’s association with Jeffrey Epstein — a relationship long scrutinised in the media. While the exact photo of Trump with Epstein has been challenged as altered, the broader context of their social connection remains firmly documented.The second verse shifts focus to Trump’s alignment with Elon Musk — portrayed as a public ally and mutual promoter of each other’s image. The lyric implies that these alliances are far from innocent, suggesting a shared investment in media power, technology influence and political positioning.Here the song introduces names less familiar to the average voter but tightly connected to Trump’s inner circle: Stephen Miller is referenced as part of the management behind the messaging, the shadow operatives shaping policy and narrative.The lyric paints a picture of hidden influence rather than visible leadership.The chorus broadens the critique: Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and former White House strategist Steve Bannon are grouped as the loyalists — the supporters mouthing clichés and defending the indefensible. She calls out those who, in her view, reduce politics to spectacle and slogans, while playing crucial roles in shaping Trump’s current political strategy.In the bridge Earth to Eve references recent data showing Trump’s approval ratings slipping in several battleground states. The lyric suggests a time when the applause ends, the supporters disperse, and the isolated figure remains. The underlying message is: no king, no god, just human flesh and blood — even those at the top are vulnerable when the base evaporates.Earth to Eve introduced the track via an Instagram reel: quick-cut visuals, text overlays quoting lines like “no man to vote”, and snippets of the chorus. The reel has generated strong engagement among Gen Z and young millennials, who are resonating with the idea of rejecting hero-worship in politics.","Young artist Earth to Eve has just released a provocative new track and accompanying Instagram reel that targets US President Donald Trump and his network.

UAE Hajj 2026 season records 72,000 applications for 6,228 slots





In a sweeping overhaul ahead of the 1447H / 2026 pilgrimage season, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s religious authorities have unveiled strict new health regulations that will decide who qualifies for the sacred journey and who doesn’t.The General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments and Zakat (Awqaf) has announced that all Emirati pilgrims must pass a comprehensive medical examination confirming their ability to perform the physically demanding Hajj rituals. The authority said it would coordinate closely with Saudi health agencies to screen and verify medical reports, ensuring that every pilgrim meets safety and fitness standards.Awqaf underlined that only those free from chronic or debilitating conditions will qualify, bringing the UAE fully in line with Saudi Arabia’s stringent health policies.Under the new rules, anyone affected by major organ failure such as kidney or heart failure will be barred from participating.The list of disqualifying conditions also includes:Pilgrims are also required to complete all specified immunisations well before travel, including:The UAE’s Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) has issued advisory notes highlighting the importance of physical preparation and injury prevention.Pilgrims are urged to begin light exercise at least three weeks before travel, maintain hydration, and carry essential medicines prescribed by their doctors.Given the extreme temperatures and crowd density during Hajj, MoHAP’sguidelines include advice to recognise and prevent heat exhaustion or sunstroke. Symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and rapid heartbeat warrant immediate rest and hydration. The checklist for pilgrims includes:Interest in the pilgrimage remains sky-high despite the tighter rules. Awqaf confirmed that 72,000 applications were filed for the UAE’s 6,228 allocated slots before registration closed on October 9, 2025. Screening and preliminary approvals are now underway, with selected applicants to be contacted via official communications. Those approved must complete documentation within the deadlines to secure their Hajj permits.Officials describe the move as part of a broader push towards a safe, medically fit, and sustainable pilgrimage experience in 2026. UAE’s focus is the wellbeing of every pilgrim, and compliance with the health and vaccination requirements safeguards not only individuals but the entire congregation performing Hajj.For thousands across the Emirates, however, the message is clear: only those in sound physical and mental health will make the sacred journey to Makkah next year.","UAE's General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments and Zakat (Awqaf) has announced medical requirements for pilgrims to perform Hajj.

V2X: What the new system is and why it matters?

Israeli Teen Jailed For Refusing To Serve IDF Over 'GAZA GENOCIDE' Gets Support | WATCH

Countdown Timers: A live display showing the remaining green light duration or the expected delay on the red light.

Optimal Speed Advice: Recommended speeds for drivers approaching an intersection to ensure a smooth, non-stop crossing.

Instant Alerts: Notifications for accidents, road closures, congestion, or necessary detours ahead.

AI-powered traffic management

Real-Time Analysis: The system uses computer vision to analyze footage from roadside cameras. It instantly detects congestion patterns, counts the volume and type of vehicles, and even monitors pedestrians and cyclists.

Intelligent Coordination: The system doesn't just manage one intersection; it coordinates entire road corridors to move ""platoons"" of vehicles smoothly across multiple traffic lights. This network management drastically reduces unnecessary stops.

Digital Twin Simulation: Before any new timing strategy is applied in the real world, the system tests it using a digital twin—a virtual copy of the road network. This ensures all adjustments are optimized and effective.

Possible roll-out date

Phase 1 Completion (UTC-UX Fusion): The AI-driven dynamic system is on track for full implementation across roughly 300 major intersections by the third quarter of 2026.

V2X Rollout (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure): The new V2X network is scheduled for full deployment and integration across all 620 signalized intersections between 2027 and 2028.

Will my new car be ready?

For New Cars: The RTA is actively collaborating with international car manufacturers to ensure that new vehicles entering the Dubai market are factory-equipped with the necessary built-in connectivity to talk to the V2X network.

For Older Cars: If you own an older vehicle, you will still benefit from the overall congestion reduction and can likely access key information through add-on devices or popular smartphone integration applications like CarPlay and Android Auto that display live traffic data on your screen.





The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai is rolling out a massive upgrade that will fundamentally change how residents drive. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a new technology called V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything), the city is moving beyond simple timed signals. This next-generation system promises to cut congestion by up to 37% and deliver real-time traffic information directly to your vehicle’s dashboard, making the experience smoother, safer, and faster.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai has announced a new smart traffic system, labelled the V2X-network (Vehicle-to-Everything) that will link traffic signals directly to vehicles. It will send real-time information from intersections and traffic lights directly to car dashboards in connected vehicles. For older vehicles, the RTA says add-on devices or compatible apps (via CarPlay/Android Auto) will allow drivers to access the live traffic data.Drivers will receive crucial, real-time information, including:The core of this transformation is the advanced traffic signal control system known as UTC-UX Fusion. Unlike older systems that operate on fixed timers, this innovation uses cutting-edge technology to manage the road network dynamically.Here’s how the AI system is already making a difference:The results from early phases are impressive: intersection efficiency has already improved by up to 37% in key areas like Jumeirah Street, with an overall reduction in travel times across the city ranging from 10% to 20%.This massive undertaking aligns perfectly with Dubai's overarching vision to be a global leader in intelligent and sustainable mobility.Yes, the system is designed for the future of cars.Dubai’s RTA is moving ahead with its vision of smart mobility by launching a system that links traffic signals directly to vehicles, powered by AI, digital twin simulations and V2X communications. For drivers, this means the dashboard might soon become your real-time co-pilot: showing signal changes, delays, recommended speeds and helping avoid unnecessary stops.","The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai is rolling out a massive upgrade that will fundamentally change how residents drive. By integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a new technology called V2X (Vehicle-to- Everything), the city is moving beyond simple timed signals. This next- generation system promises to cut congestion by up to 37% and deliver real-time traffic information directly to your vehicle’s dashboard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124778414,imgsize-1399885,width-400,resizemode-4/rta-ai-system.jpg"

Protecting youth: UAE’s vigilance against hidden substance threats









Abu Dhabi Police have firmly dismissed circulating social media rumours about so-called “red pills” being distributed in schools and universities, reinforcing the importance of verified information and community vigilance. The denial comes as authorities continue to strengthen digital and physical security awareness across the UAE.Brigadier Taher Gharib Al Dhaheri, Director of the Anti-Narcotics Directorate at the Abu Dhabi Police General Command, confirmed that reports of red pills in educational institutions are entirely baseless, according to. He stated,Al Dhaheri further highlighted the broader context, noting,He emphasized the critical need to rely on official sources, adding that Abu Dhabi Police maintain transparency and trust in their public engagement and “never hide anything” from the community.Abu Dhabi Police maintain a continuous presence in schools, universities, and community spaces, engaging with students, parents, and other stakeholders to raise awareness on a wide range of issues—from crime prevention and digital safety to substance abuse and child protection. These programmes regularly involve visits to campuses, community councils, and public forums, emphasizing practical guidance on safeguarding personal, financial, and social wellbeing.An example of such efforts is the ongoing sixth edition of the “Be Cautious” campaign, a three-month initiative organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior, other police departments, the UAE Cybersecurity Council, Abu Dhabi Media, First Abu Dhabi Bank, and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. The campaign highlights emerging online fraud methods, such as phishing links, misleading phone calls, fake prize notifications, and fraudulent e-commerce sites, while also reinforcing broader messages of vigilance and responsible behaviour in everyday life.Events and educational programmes are conducted across social and traditional media, community councils, universities, and schools, ensuring that all segments of society are informed. Brigadier Al Dhaheri emphasized stakeholder collaboration as a key factor in maximizing outreach and public impact.The handling of such rumours is supported by the Federal Decree-Law No. 55 of 2023 on Media Regulation, which organizes the media activities of individuals, organizations, media outlets, and free zones dedicated to media in the UAE. According to the decree:Crucially, the law prohibits:Violations can result in administrative fines, closure of the media institution, or cancellation of media licenses, underscoring the UAE’s zero-tolerance approach to misinformation.Federal Decree-Law No. 34 of 2021 on Combatting Rumors and Cybercrimes, along with other applicable laws protecting privacy, reputation, and preventing defamation, also apply to social media use. Citizens and residents in the UAE need to be aware of the provisions of these laws, which clearly spell out actions that could constitute a criminal offence.The “red pills” rumours are particularly alarming because adolescents and young adults are at a stage of exploration and identity formation, which can increase their vulnerability to substance use. However, the UAE maintains some of the world’s strictest anti-drug laws, ensuring that such threats are promptly addressed. Authorities are calling on families, schools, and universities to strengthen cooperation in protecting youth from such hidden dangers. Parents are urged to pay attention to where their children go, who they befriend, and what they bring home.Recent investigations have uncovered sophisticated new tactics used by drug traffickers to smuggle toxic substances into the local market, employing methods so deceptive that the items appear harmless to the unsuspecting eye. Officials report that traffickers are increasingly camouflaging these substances as everyday products that young people often use or consume, such as energy drinks, chewing gum, or even flavoured paper, highlighting the importance of vigilance and community awareness.",Abu Dhabi Police have firmly dismissed circulating social media rumours about so-called “red pills” being distributed in schools and universities.

How UAE's digital system prioritizes first-time pilgrims?

Registration process and criteria

Bottom line





The UAE’s General Authority for Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat has reported a historic surge in Hajj 2026 applications, with approximately 72,000 residents applying for a quota of just 6,228 pilgrims. This unprecedented number of applicants marks one of the highest submission rates in recent years and demonstrates the enduring spiritual significance of the pilgrimage for Emiratis.The spiritual call to perform Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, has drawn unprecedented demand in the UAE for the upcoming 2026 (1447 AH) season. The General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat (Awqaf) confirmed that approximately 72,000 applicants submitted their requests. This colossal number is competing for an official national quota set by Saudi Arabia: just 6,228 spots.This intense competition means the odds of selection are approximately 1 in 11.5. The registration window, which ran from September 24 to October 9, 2025, saw the demand surge digitally through Awqaf's smart app and official website. Authorities have begun the rigorous process of granting preliminary approvals, with final selection adhering strictly to the governance set by the Cabinet Resolution No.(32) of 2018.The UAE uses a lottery-based selection system to manage oversubscription fairly:This system ensures no bias in selection and gives all qualified applicants a fair chance, despite the record-breaking demand.Applicants can quickly check their selection status using the official UAE channels:Tip: Only applicants with confirmed notifications should proceed with travel arrangements and payments. Those not selected can stay on the waiting list for possible future allocation.To manage this overwhelming demand transparently and efficiently, the UAE relies entirely on a digital-first approach for applications. The entire process from registration to initial approval was conducted online. This early opening of registration months in advance is a key strategy to enhance efficiency and streamline services for the selected pilgrims.A core principle guiding the selection process is fairness, specifically prioritizing those who are undertaking the pilgrimage for the first time. The electronic system is designed to give preference to Emirati citizens who have not yet performed Hajj, ensuring that as many people as possible get the chance to fulfill this once-in-a-lifetime religious duty. Once preliminary approval is granted, applicants are contacted via their registered phone numbers and must strictly adhere to deadlines to finalize all necessary permits and procedures. Furthermore, the authorities have implemented a new, stricter accreditation system for Hajj campaign operators, focusing on vetting travel agencies for their service quality, financial stability, and track record.Registration for Hajj 2026 was conducted through the Authority’s official channels, including its smart app and website, with a deadline of October 9, 2025. The selection process adheres to Cabinet Resolution No. (32) of 2018 concerning the Hajj and Umrah System, ensuring a fair and transparent allocation of spots. Applicants who receive preliminary approval will be contacted via their registered phone numbers and must adhere to specified timelines to complete all necessary procedures.In anticipation of the upcoming pilgrimage, the Office for the Affairs of UAE Pilgrims has initiated comprehensive preparations to provide the best possible services and care for UAE pilgrims in the holy sites. This includes ensuring that all their needs are met with dedication and responsibility, upholding the UAE Government’s vision of excellence and quality.The high number of applicants for Hajj 2026 reflects the enduring spiritual commitment of UAE residents.

Apple is reportedly planning to show ads in Maps next year. In his weekly newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman writes that the Cupertino-based company “is focusing on Apple Maps, which will allow restaurants and other businesses to pay to have their details featured more prominently within the app’s searches. ” The concept will be similar to Search ads inside of the App Store, “where developers can pay for their software to appear in a promoted slot based on user queries.”According to Gurman, ads in Apple Maps will have a better interface “than what Google and other companies offer”. He further adds that the iPhone maker plans to leverage AI to ensure that results are relevant and useful.The newsletter further states that the move could bring “potential” backlash from consumers. Gurman states that some Apple fans are already unhappy that the iPhone has been turned into a digital billboard for services like AppleCare+, Apple Music, Apple TV and Fitness+. “When you consider that an iPhone can cost up to $2,000, some see this as an unseemly money grab,” Gurman writes in the newsletter.In a related news, Apple is also said to be working on a vapor chamber to improve cooling and performance in its upcoming iPad Pro. Slated to launch as early as 2027, the vapor chamber in iPad Pro will replace the need for a fan — like those found in the MacBook Pro and Vision Pro. It also enables higher performance “because there’s less throttling, where the operating system slow downs the processor to make sure it doesn’t overheat”.","Apple is reportedly planning to show ads in Maps next year.

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109034604,imgsize-54266,width-400,resizemode-4/109034604.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips.

OpenAI faces accusations of ignoring child safety concerns





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently announced that the company plans to ""safely relax the restrictions"" on erotic conversations within ChatGPT. The move is a significant policy shift, allowing adults to engage in ""hot and heavy"" chats, a departure from the AI giant's policy of restricting sexual content. The change comes, Altman said, after engineers built new safeguards around sensitive mental health content.""Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,"" Altman stated in a post on X (formerly Twitter).He framed the decision around a core company principle: ""As part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults."" The new policy is expected to roll out by December.The announcement follows a comment Sam Altman made just months prior, in an August 7 podcast interview with Cleo Abram, where he appeared to boast about not having created a ""sex bot."" When asked about a decision that was ""best for the world but not best for winning,"" Altman replied by emphasizing the ""very special relationship"" OpenAI has with its users, built on trying to ""help you accomplish whatever you ask.""He stated the company has refrained from actions that could ""grow [the company] faster"" or get users to ""spend more time in ChatGPT,"" citing the long-term incentive of staying aligned with users. When pressed for a specific example, Altman stated: ""Well, we haven’t put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet.""The decision to open up to erotic content for adults comes amid mounting scrutiny over ChatGPT's impact on minors. OpenAI has been hit with multiple lawsuits from parents alleging the chatbot offered harmful or even suicidal guidance to teens. In one tragic case, a family is suing the company, claiming the AI encouraged their son to take his own life.The company has also faced accusations of allowing its systems to feed sexually explicit or dangerous advice to underage users, prompting federal and state regulators to open inquiries into AI companies' safeguards.In recent months, OpenAI has attempted to assuage the furor by introducing parental controls and a restricted teen version of the app. The new settings allow parents to link accounts, monitor usage, and block explicit or self-harm content.Despite these fixes, advocacy groups argue the measures don't go far enough, contending that AI chatbots remain too unpredictable and powerful to be safely used by children. The introduction of ""erotica for verified adults"" will now put the onus on OpenAI's engineers to ensure their new safeguards can effectively verify user age and wall off the mature content from its younger user base.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the company plans to ""safely relax the restrictions"" on erotic conversations within ChatGPT.

What Microsoft said about the new Gaming Copilot feature



“When you're actively using Gaming Copilot in Game Bar, it can use screenshots of your gameplay to get a better understanding of what's happening in your game and provide you with more helpful responses.”

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

What was the controversy surrounding the Gaming Copilot feature



“This installed automatically on my PC, and watching the network traffic, I realised (sic) it was automatically sending everything I was doing to Microsoft (including an NDA'd game I'm playing. I checked the settings, and by default, it's set to train on text seen on the screen — it screenshots everything, and OCRs text from in-game and sends it to MS. MS then uses what you're doing to train their AI models.”

Microsoft has issued an official statement clarifying that its Gaming Copilot feature only accesses gameplay screenshots when users are actively engaged with the AI tool. The tech giant has also emphasised that these screenshots are not used to train AI models. The clarification came after a user on the ResetEra forums raised privacy concerns, claiming their system's network traffic showed the AI feature sending information about their actions, including private on-screen details, to Microsoft's servers. This came after the company recently launched the Gaming Copilot feature as a public beta on Windows 11 through the operating system's built-in Xbox Game Bar.In a statement to Tom's Hardware, a Microsoft representative explained:The company stressed that Gaming Copilot is optional and only accesses gameplay during active use. Microsoft separately noted that text or voice conversations with Gaming Copilot may be used to train and improve AI systems. Users can modify the feature's privacy settings through the Game Bar's Settings menu under “Privacy Settings.”The controversy began with a forum post where a user named RedbullCola wrote:Currently, it's unclear whether Gaming Copilot sends screenshot data to an external server or processes it locally using the system's built-in NPU.We've sent follow-up questions to Microsoft.Xbox Support does not list the required specifications to run the feature, but the company says it willThe feature works on devices that aren't Copilot+ certified (i.e., those without built-in NPUs).

The company says it only takes screenshots when users are actively engaging with the feature, and that the AI training feature can be disabled in settings.However, if users want to remove it entirely, there's no straightforward uninstallation method as it's built into the Game Bar.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai celebrates new breakthrough in quantum algorithm; Elon Musk replies: ‘Looks like…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-celebrates-new-breakthrough-in-quantum-algorithm-elon-musk-replies-looks-like/articleshow/124754841.cms,"



What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Why Google’s Willow chip experiment matters





Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms. “Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage,” Pichai wrote in the post, adding it is “13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers”. Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released.

GitHub faces mounting pressure from new AI coding tools





Microsoft's strategy: AI tools available everywhere developers work





Microsoft is overhauling its GitHub platform to combat rising competition from AI coding rivals like Cursor and Claude Code, with CEO Satya Nadella invoking Bill Gates ' decades-old frustration about software fragmentation to explain the transformation, according to an internal meeting reviewed by Business Insider.Nadella told employees that Gates ""used to always say that there's only one category: It's called Information Management,"" expressing frustration over why users needed different apps for documents, websites, and software development. AI is finally erasing those boundaries, Nadella said, declaring ""there is none"" when asked about the difference between apps, documents, and websites in the AI era.The remarks came as Microsoft executives addressed employee concerns about GitHub losing ground to competitors. Despite GitHub Copilot remaining the top AI coding assistant in recent surveys, Business Insider reported that the tool has lost market share to Cursor in a key developer segment, according to Barclays data.An engineer at the meeting specifically asked how Microsoft planned to counter ""Cursor or Claude Code, which are moving quickly and capturing a lot of mindshare."" Jay Parikh, who leads Microsoft's CoreAI unit overseeing GitHub, acknowledged the challenge: ""GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code.""Microsoft's solution involves making GitHub's AI capabilities accessible across all platforms—command line interfaces, web browsers, various coding applications like VS Code, and other Microsoft products. The company also envisions GitHub becoming a central dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.Parikh emphasized GitHub is ""shipping faster than it's ever been shipping before, shipping updates to our users every day, if not multiple times a day."" He also echoed Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's position that the company should diversify beyond its OpenAI partnership, stating Microsoft wants to remain ""the place where developers have that choice"" of surfaces, modes, and models.The overhaul follows GitHub's CEO departure in August and comes as Microsoft pushes employees to increase internal AI usage in performance evaluations.",GitHub faces mounting pressure from new AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code.
