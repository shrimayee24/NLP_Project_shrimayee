NHAI to roll out route patrolling vehicles for quicker aid & maintenance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-to-roll-out-route-patrolling-vehicles-for-quicker-aid-maintenance/articleshow/116304712.cms,"NHAI

NEW DELHI: In its bid to improve highway patrol, NHAI on Friday issued a fresh guideline for Route Patrolling Vehicles (RPVs) branded as “Rajmarg Saathi”, which will be equipped with advanced tools to reduce traffic disruption and better maintenance. These vehicles will be deployed on every 50 km section for dealing with emergency incidents and for quick maintenance.An NHAI spokesperson said that in the existing RPVs, the rear space is open for keeping instruments and equipment to support in case of emergency situations. “However, due to open space, the operators were not able to keep these equipment in a well organised manner, which at times lead to delay in taking prompt action. In order to overcome such a situation, the rear or trunk of RPV has now been replaced by a closed cabinet with dedicated space for different equipment and inventory. The shelves have been created to provide quick and easy access to different equipment during the emergency situations and is a significant upgrade from the earlier RPVs,” he added.These vehicles will also have an advanced feature of dashboard cameras equipped with ‘ AI video analytics ’ to capture and identify cracks and potholes. These will also capture details such as vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, and other infrastructure assets. “The data and video footage including road distresses shall be collected on a weekly basis by NHAI and this road distresses data shall be integrated with NHAI One application for more efficient maintenance of roads,” the official added.Officials said the manpower deployed in these vehicles will be properly trained to use the tolls. To ensure service fitness of the vehicle, the RPV will be replaced with a new RPV, once it exceeds a run of 3,00,000 km or has been in operation for three years.“Since our RPVs are always on the routes (in every 8 hours shift) they can be the first ones to reach any spot or find deficiencies for quick action. The new guidelines help better maintenance of highway stretches and minimise disruption,” said an NHAI official.", Route Patrolling Vehicles (RPVs) branded as ‘Rajmarg Saathi’ will be equipped with advanced tools to reduce traffic disruption and better maintenance.

"Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iranian-singer-performs-online-concert-without-hijab-faces-prosecution/articleshow/116256617.cms,"Iranian singer performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours while exhibiting no signs of anxiety.The contest took place at a shopping centre in Chongqing municipality on November 29, as reported by Jimu News.Ten contestants, selected from 100 applicants, were invited to the mall to participate in the competition, which required them to spend eight hours on a designated new bed. Before the contest, they surrendered their mobile phones and were prohibited from using any other electronic devices, including iPads and laptops, the South China Morning Post reported.In emergency situations, participants could use older mobile phone models with only calling capabilities, provided by the competition organisers, to contact their families.They were also required to adhere to a bed restriction rule, which allowed them to leave the bed for toilet breaks, but limited them to a maximum of five minutes each time.The organisers set a quota for the total amount of time contestants could be away from their beds throughout the eight-hour period, although this detail was not disclosed in the news report.Drinks and meals were provided, and participants were instructed to consume them in bed.In addition to being prohibited from using their mobile phones, competitors were not allowed to fall into a deep sleep or exhibit anxiety. They wore wrist straps to monitor their sleep quality and anxiety levels.Most contestants spent their time reading books or simply resting with their eyes closed.Ultimately, after verification by event officials, a woman surnamed Dong was declared the champion, achieving a comprehensive score of 88.99 out of 100. The organisers noted that she spent the longest time in bed, did not experience deep sleep, and displayed the lowest level of anxiety.The 10,000-yuan prizewinner donned pyjamas for the competition, earning her the nickname “pyjama sister” on mainland social media as the no-mobile-phone race gained viral attention online.Dong is a sales manager at a finance firm. In her spare time, she typically tutors her child and rarely browses her mobile phone aimlessly.The identity of the company sponsoring the competition and the purpose behind holding this event, which occurred in a mattress and bedding shop within the mall, remains undisclosed.","A woman in southwestern China won 10,000 yuan (Rs 1, 16,000) from a competition for abstaining from mobile phone use for eight hours.

'Ban OnlyFans': Adult star Lily Phillips breaks down after sleeping with 101 guys in one day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ban-onlyfans-adult-star-lily-phillips-breaks-down-after-sleeping-with-101-guys-in-one-day/articleshow/116215033.cms,"I Slept With 100 Men in One Day | Documentary

Adult star Lily Phillips , originally from Derbyshire, became a TikTok sensation in October after engaging in an extreme challenge—sleeping with 101 men in a single day. However, in new footage, she described the experience as ""intense"" and admitted she is uncertain whether she would recommend it to others.The 23-year-old, who has earned £2 million through OnlyFans , shared her emotional reflection in a documentary by YouTuber Josh Pieters titled I Slept With 100 Men in One Day. Despite previously expressing enthusiasm for the challenge and her work, the behind-the-scenes footage shows a different side, with Lily visibly shaken and in tears.Speaking through tears, she told Pieters, ""It’s not for the weak girls, if I’m honest – it was hard. I don’t know if I’d recommend it. It’s a different feeling. It’s just one in, one out; it feels intense."" When asked if the experience was more overwhelming than she anticipated, she confirmed: ""Definitely.""Lily announced a plan to sleep with 1,000 men in one day. This announcement has caused public discussion. Some people want OnlyFans, the platform where the content would appear, to be banned. Despite the personal cost, Lily “expressed interest in attempting an even larger challenge—sleeping with 1,000 men in a single day.”One social media user wrote, ""Lily Phillips reflects on her sadness after sleeping with 100 guys in 1 day – 1) she’s responsible for her own behaviour in this sick stunt, 2) it’s also clear OF has turned women into plastic dolls – and the 'models' themselves have bought this heartbreaking lie.BAN ONLYFANS NOW."" The tweet has since amassed over 7.7 million views and 19,000 likes.Critics claim the footage highlights the damaging impact of OnlyFans, with one commenting, ""Lily Phillips talking about how traumatic it is to sleep with 100 men is exactly why we should be against OnlyFans."" Another said, ""Look at this woman’s eyes. She has degraded herself so badly for validation. I pray she reflects on this stunt and sees her own intrinsic value. OnlyFans is making this possible, and it needs banning.""However, not everyone agrees that the platform should be banned. Some empathised with Lily, with one user writing, ""Poor girl. She needs a big hug."" Others argued she made her own choices, with one person stating, ""She chose to do this and profit from it. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?""Supporters of OnlyFans contend the issue is more nuanced. ""OnlyFans isn’t inherently good or bad. Society needs to get better at dealing with it.

"'No burgers, soft drinks and burgers': UK bans daytime TV ads for junk food in bid to tackle child obesity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-burgers-soft-drinks-and-burgers-uk-bans-daytime-tv-ads-for-junk-food-in-bid-to-tackle-child-obesity/articleshow/116004661.cms,"Rising child obesity in UK

What will be covered in the ambit of the ban?

The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods, including popular items like granola, muffins, and pastries, as part of its ongoing efforts to combat rising childhood obesity.News agency AFP reported that the new regulations, set to take effect in October next year, will restrict ads for “less healthy” food and drinks to airing only after the 9:00 pm watershed.The ban targets specific products identified as unhealthy based on their sugar, fat, and salt content, but does not apply to the broader advertising of fast food chains. For example, ads from fast food restaurants will remain permissible as long as they do not feature specific items like burgers or fries, according to a BBC report.Highlighting the importance of these measures, health secretary Wes Streeting said, “Obesity robs our kids of the best possible start in life, sets them up for a lifetime of health problems, and costs the NHS billions. This government is taking action now to end the targeting of junk food ads at kids, across both TV and online.”According to the National Health Service (NHS), obesity rates among children in the UK are on the rise, with one in 10 four-year-olds now classified as obese. Additionally, one in five five-year-olds suffers from tooth decay linked to excessive sugar consumption. The government’s new approach aims to address these alarming statistics and prevent further health complications down the line.The ban includes a variety of items that are commonly marketed to children, such as fast food, soft drinks, ready meals, and pre-packaged sugary breakfast foods. Products like croissants, pancakes, waffles, cereal bars, and sweetened yoghurts will be affected, alongside chickpea or lentil-based crisps, seaweed snacks, energy drinks, and processed foods like hamburgers and chicken nuggets.However, healthier alternatives will be exempt from the restrictions. Natural porridge oats and unsweetened yoghurt, for instance, will not fall under the new rules.The government hopes that by reducing the exposure of children to these adverts, it can help prevent an estimated 20,000 cases of childhood obesity each year.","The UK government has announced a ban on daytime TV adverts for sugary foods.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.The Wales family welcomed a new cocker spaniel named Orla in 2020. James Middleton bred the dog. This followed the death of their previous dog, Lupo.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meta Video Seal: Protecting against AI-generated videos

Facebook-parent Meta is taking another step towards its Metaverse vision with the release of "" Meta Motivo ,"" a new AI model designed to enhance the realism and interactivity of digital avatars . This advancement can lead to more lifelike characters and immersive experiences within virtual worlds.Meta Motivo can control the movements of virtual characters in a more realistic and human-like manner, having this technology has potential applications in the Metaverse, gaming and animation.Meta Motivo focuses on improving the way digital avatars move and interact, addressing common issues with unrealistic or robotic movements. By enabling more human-like motion, the model aims to create a more believable and engaging Metaverse experience.“Meta Motivo achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised reinforcement learning and model-based baselines, while exhibiting more human-like behaviors,” the company said.Meta explains that unlike traditional methods that require extensive labeled data and specific training for each task, Meta Motivo learns from a vast collection of unlabeled motion data.By observing a diverse range of human movements, the model can generate more natural and realistic animations for virtual characters. Additionally, it can perform various whole-body control tasks, such as motion tracking and reaching for objects, without needing to be explicitly trained for each task.Along with Motivo, Meta also launched Meta Video Seal – an open-source framework for watermarking AI-generated videos . This technology allows creators to embed invisible watermarks that can be used to verify the origin and authenticity of videos, helping to combat the spread of misinformation and manipulated content.",Meta Motivo can control the movements of virtual characters in a more realistic and human-like manner.

Apple’s new HomePod mini and Apple TV coming next year will have this one big chip change,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-new-homepod-mini-and-apple-tv-coming-next-year-will-have-this-one-big-chip-change/articleshow/116281276.cms,"Apple is preparing its own custom-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, set to debut in the HomePod mini and Apple TV in 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.The new wireless component, internally dubbed ""Proxima,"" represents Apple's latest move to reduce reliance on third-party suppliers. Manufactured by TSMC, the chip will support the Wi-Fi 6E standard, promising improved bandwidth and faster data speeds for Apple's home devices.Gurman reports that the Proxima chip will first appear in refreshed Apple TV and HomePod mini hardware, potentially enabling more seamless device integration and quicker data synchronization. While the first-generation chip may not completely match Broadcom's current capabilities, it marks a crucial milestone in Apple's silicon independence strategy.The wireless chip is part of a broader technological roadmap that extends beyond home devices. Apple plans to expand the Proxima technology to iPhones later in 2025, with iPad and Mac integration expected in 2026.This chip development coincides with Apple's other ambitious in-house technology projects, including a custom cellular modem expected to debut in the 2025 iPhone SE. The modem, code-named ""Sinope,"" represents Apple's goal of reducing dependence on external suppliers like Qualcomm.Apple's long-term strategy involves creating more tightly integrated and energy-efficient wireless solutions across its product lineup.

"Google and Samsung's Vision Pro challenger, the Project Moohan, runs Android, has Gemini AI, and is coming next year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-and-samsungs-vision-pro-challenger-the-project-moohan-runs-android-has-gemini-ai-and-is-coming-next-year/articleshow/116280628.cms,"Google makes Android spatial for XR headsets

Project Moohan is just the beginning of Google's XR dreams

Google seems to have settled on the idea of spatial computing, and we might have Apple to thank for that. Google, in collaboration with Samsung , has developed a new platform for spatial computing – the Android XR , which, as it reads, is a custom version of Android, made for the mixed-reality headsets and just like any other piece of tech right now also integrates artificial intelligence, with Google's own Gemini at work here.The first device from the two is coming next year, codenamed Project Moohan , which is an XR headset much like Apple's Vision Pro (it even shares the aesthetics with it).Android XR leverages Google's existing Android ecosystem, and with its new platform, Google is positioning itself to democratize spatial computing. The platform will support a wide range of devices, from headsets to smart glasses , with most existing Android mobile apps automatically compatible.Gemini AI sits at the core of the experience, enabling multimodal interactions that transcend traditional computing interfaces. Users can control devices through natural language, hand gestures, and contextual conversations. Google says that its suite of apps, which essentially includes YouTube, Maps, Chrome, and Google TV, will be reimagined for spatial experiences, providing an immersive ecosystem out of the box.Users will be able to control the device through natural, multimodal inputs like voice commands, hand gestures, and contextual conversations with the AI assistant.Unlike previous attempts like Google Glass or Daydream, Project Moohan appears to be more meticulously designed. Its name, ""Moohan,"" meaning ""infinity"" in Korean, reflects Samsung's vision of ""unparalleled, immersive experiences within an infinite space.""Project Moohan is still in the prototyping phase, and the design we see as of now shows it to be very similar to Apple's Vision Pro. While we don't know much about the specifics, Samsung says that the headset will have ""state-of-the-art displays and passthrough capabilities."" Gemini asides, the Project Moohan will also have Galaxy AI working on it. What we also know is that headset will be powered by one of Qualcomm’s chips.Google and Samsung are targeting multiple device categories, with plans not just for the headset but also for smart glasses offering ""all-day help"" powered by Gemini AI. These glasses, which Google says the prototypes of are already going out to some users, could provide real-time navigation, translation, and contextual information directly in a user's field of view.This isn’t Google’s or either Samsung’s first rodeo in the in headset space. Google have been trying their luck in the virtual/ augmented reality for almost a decade now. There was Google Glasses, the DayDream, Project Tango , and they even tried making cardboard headsets. Samsung have also dipped their toes in this reality with the Gear VR, a headset which came along with some of its phones, but never really took off. Now with the Vision Pro in this reality space, it’s going to be tussle worth looking forward to.","Google and Samsung have developed a new platform for spatial computing.

With this move Blinkit aims to give competition to Zepto Cafe and Swiggy Bolt, the same kind of services launched recently.Bistro operates on a similar model to its competitors, offering a curated selection of snacks, beverages, and meals from strategically located kitchens. The app currently appears to be in a pilot phase, with limited availability in certain areas of Gurugram.“Craving something delicious but short on time? Bistro is your ultimate food delivery companion, bringing a world of flavors to your doorstep in just 10 minutes! Whether it's a quick snack, a hearty meal, or a refreshing beverage, we've got you covered with an extensive menu to suit every craving and occasion,” reads the app description on Google Play Store.Blinkit's existing network of dark stores and delivery infrastructure gives it a potential edge in the race. By leveraging these resources, Blinkit can potentially achieve faster delivery times and wider reach for Bistro.This isn't Zomato's first foray into the 10-minute delivery arena. The company previously attempted a similar service named Zomato Instant, which was ultimately discontinued. Whether Bistro will fare better remains to be seen.Earlier this week, Zepto also announced a similar service called Zepto Café. Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO of Zepto, announced the strategic move on social media, emphasizing the company's rapid growth and innovative approach. ""We're launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week! The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it's worth it to launch fast :D Café is scaling rapidly: we're launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day.""While the Cafe offerings will be available through the new standalone app, customers can still access these services via the main Zepto application.","Blinkit, the quick commerce arm of Zomato, is revving up its delivery services with the launch of Bistro.
