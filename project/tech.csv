How the Nasal Spray works

Comparison Nasal Spray Vaccine (LAIV) Injectable Flu Shot (IIV) Technology Uses a live attenuated (weakened) virus Uses inactivated (dead) virus or viral components Administration Needle-free nasal spray (one puff per nostril) Injection into the muscle Immunity Focus Boosts mucosal and systemic immunity Boosts systemic (blood) immunity Key Advantage Ideal for those with needle anxiety; quick & painless Suitable for all ages and high-risk groups

Who is eligible?

Healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.



Healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years.



Who must avoid the Nasal Mist?

Children under 2 years old: They face an increased risk of wheezing or respiratory distress.

In a major health advancement, the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) has introduced a new influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal spray, marking the first time this option has been officially registered and rolled out in the country.This development is part of the UAE’s strategic push to expand safe immunisation options, boost overall vaccine coverage, and strengthen the community’s defence against seasonal viruses. This simple mist, known commercially as FluMist Quadrivalent (or Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine - LAIV), is a game-changer, especially for two key groups: children and anyone with a fear of injections.Forget the sting; this vaccine is an easy, single spray into each nostril.But how does a puff of mist protect you from the flu? The answer lies in its unique technology, which mimics a natural infection where the virus typically enters the body: the nose and throat.The weakened virus in the spray is ""cold-adapted"" and can only grow at the cooler temperatures found in the nasal cavity. It cannot thrive in the higher temperature of the lungs, making it safe and unable to cause the flu itself. By stimulating immunity right at the entry point, it builds powerful local protection and is proven to be highly effective, particularly in children.The new nasal spray is specifically approved for healthy individuals within a tight age bracket. If you fall outside of this range, or have certain underlying health conditions, you must opt for the traditional injectable shot.The nasal flu mist is exclusively for:The primary aim of the nasal mist is to provide an accessible and pain-free alternative. It is administered in a single dose (two sprays) per flu season for most people aged nine and older. Children aged two to eight who have never had a flu vaccine before may require two doses, spaced at least a month apart.Because the nasal spray uses a weakened live virus, it is not suitable for everyone. These six groups are strictly advised by MOHAP and global health authorities to avoid the nasal spray and receive the standard injectable flu shot instead:Important Allergy Alert: Anyone with a severe allergy to eggs, gelatin, gentamicin, arginine, or any other vaccine component, or who has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous flu vaccine, should not receive the nasal spray.Aspirin Warning: Children and adolescents (2-17 years old) who are currently taking aspirin or salicylate-containing medicines must also avoid the nasal mist due to the rare risk of developing Reye’s syndrome.The nasal spray vaccine is now available at selected public and private health facilities across the UAE. While the cost may vary depending on your provider and insurance coverage, some private centers are offering the dose for approximately AED 200. By adding this highly effective, non-invasive option, the UAE has made protecting yourself and your family from the flu season easier than ever. Always consult your healthcare provider to confirm your eligibility and ensure you choose the best vaccine option for your specific health profile.",UAE launches new nasal flu vaccine for residents.

Historic first crewed eVTOL flight in Dubai

The aircraft, speeds and where you’ll board?

Qatar’s quiet coup





Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight, a short point-to-point journey being hailed as a milestone on the road to commercial air-taxi service in 2026.If you want the first visual, the Dubai Media Office video shows the aircraft lifting off at Margham and landing at DWC during the trials; it’s the clearest public footage of the crewed point-to-point run. Expect more test flights, phased certification steps and vertiport roll-outs through 2025–2026, ahead of the first commercial routes planned for 2026.On 16 November 2025, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Joby Aviation, completed the first crewed eVTOL flight between Margham and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), a point-to-point test that demonstrates vertical take-off, cruise and landing in an operational context. The RTA and Dubai Media Office released video and statements showing the short crewed journey as part of trials ahead of a planned 2026 launch. Watch the official clip from Dubai Media Office for the moment the aircraft lifted off and landed:[Also read: Dubai unveils 4 launch pads for Flying Taxis: Where you’ll catch the World’s first aerial taxi in 2026 Dubai’s air-taxi programme is built around the Joby Aviation S4 eVTOL, a quiet, all-electric aircraft with six rotors, four battery packs and a performance profile that allows speeds of up to 320 km/h and ranges of around 160 km per charge, making it ideal for fast city hops.Each aircraft will carry four passengers plus one pilot, offering a compact but premium cabin with panoramic windows and low noise levels compared to helicopters.To support the service, the RTA is developing a network of dedicated vertiports, starting with Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, with the DXB hub already about 60% complete and designed to handle up to 170,000 passengers a year. These strategically chosen points are meant to slash travel times—for example, a 45-minute ground trip could take just 12 minutes by air. Watch the video for a close-up look at what the air taxi offers, inside and out:Although pricing is not final, early estimates suggest fares could sit around US$75, similar to a high-end ride-hailing service, with the long-term aim of becoming competitive with regular taxis. Joby has already completed hundreds of piloted test flights globally and holds exclusive operating rights in Dubai for six years, while passengers will eventually be able to book flights through a dedicated mobile app, with fast charging and quick turnarounds enabling frequent daily operations.Overall, the system is being built as a smooth, airport-style experience, compact vertiports, efficient boarding, pilot-operated flights and seamless links to the metro, buses and taxis, making air taxis feel less like futuristic experiments and more like an everyday transport option.Days before the Dubai spectacle, Qatar secured a different, but equally significant, victory by focusing on full autonomy. On November 15, 2025, the country celebrated the successful trial of its first-ever urban passenger flight with a fully unmanned eVTOL.The event was proudly sponsored and officially witnessed by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, the Minister of Transport (MoT). The aircraft operated entirely without any direct human interference, relying completely on a full self-control system enabled by AI and sophisticated advanced air navigation technologies. Remarkably, the pilotless taxi flew successfully between the Old Doha Port and the scenic Katara Cultural Village.This initiative is a core part of the MoT Strategy 2025-2030, which aims to create a smart, resilient transportation system to support Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and reduce the nation's carbon footprint.","Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight.

Qatar’s best view yet: The fastest annual meteor shower arrives Nov 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/qatars-best-view-yet-the-fastest-annual-meteor-shower-arrives-nov-17/articleshow/125377745.cms,"Leonid meteors streak across Qatar’s night sky tonight / AI-Generated Image

What are the Leonids?

When to watch?

Where to look for Meteors?

Maximizing your meteor hunt

Moon-Free Skies: The shower peaks when the Moon is in its waning crescent phase, meaning it will be only about 9 percent illuminated. This minimal moonlight translates to significantly darker skies, preventing light pollution from the Moon itself from washing out the fainter meteors.

Find the Dark: The most crucial tip for any meteor shower is to escape city lights. Find a secluded spot far away from all sources of light pollution (such as streetlights and residential areas). Your eyes need complete darkness to adjust fully.

Go Naked-Eye: You do not need any special equipment like telescopes or binoculars; these tools are too zoomed-in to capture the sweeping path of a meteor. All you need are your naked eyes and patience.

Allow Adjustment Time: Once you arrive at your dark location, allow your eyes a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes to fully adjust to the darkness. Any bright phone screen light will immediately reset this process.

Get Comfortable: Bring a comfortable chair or blanket. Meteor viewing is a waiting game, so lie back with your feet pointing generally toward the east/northeast and scan the entire expanse of the sky.





Get ready to ditch the city lights and look up! The celestial event of the month, the Leonid meteor shower, is about to light up the sky, peaking on the night of November 16-17, 2025. These dazzling ""shooting stars"" are renowned as some of the fastest in the cosmos, created as Earth streaks through the dusty trail left by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Because this year features excellent, moon-free conditions and the potential for up to 40 meteors per hour, now is your chance to witness the natural fireworks. Read on for your simple, step-by-step guide on the best time to look up, where to point your gaze, and how to maximize your viewing success.The origin of these meteors is the tiny, dusty trail left behind by Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. As Earth orbits the Sun each November, it passes directly through this debris field. The specks of dust, most smaller than a grain of sand, vaporize upon atmospheric entry, creating the flash we observe from the ground. While typically producing a modest display, the Leonids are famously known for their meteor storms—intense periods where thousands of meteors can fall per hour, a spectacular event that occurs roughly every 33 years, coinciding with the comet’s orbital period. While 2025 is not a storm year, conditions promise excellent visibility.Astro-observers predict the shower’s peak around 18:00 UTC on 17 November 2025, that converts to 21:00 (9:00 pm) on 17 November in Qatar (UTC+3). Even so, the best practical viewing is after midnight and into the pre-dawn hours, when the Leo radiant climbs higher and more of the sky is favourable. Expect about 10–15 meteors per hour under good, dark skies (some sources give up to ~15–20/hour as a generous peak estimate).The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30, but the best viewing opportunity, the peak, occurs on the night between November 16 and 17, 2025. The absolute ideal time to watch is after midnight until the pre-dawn hours on the morning of November 17, when the meteor shower's radiant point is highest in the sky.The meteors appear to originate from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence the name Leonids), which rises in the east/northeast after midnight. While they seem to stream from Leo, viewers are advised to look 30 to 40 degrees away from the radiant. Looking away from Leo allows you to catch the meteors streaking across a wider section of the sky, maximizing the chance of seeing longer, more dramatic trails.Globally, rates are expected to be around 10 to 15 meteors per hour (ZHR). However, local astronomical experts have suggested the rate could reach up to 40 meteors per hour in exceptionally dark viewing locations, providing the potential for a significantly better display.This year presents a particularly favorable chance to view the Leonids, primarily due to the state of the Moon.As the Leonids sweep across Qatar’s sky on November 17, this is your once-a-year chance to slow down, look up, and enjoy a natural light show that needs nothing more than clear skies and a little patience. Whether you're watching from the desert, the coastline, or your rooftop, the night promises a mix of calm, wonder, and those brief streaks of magic that remind us how alive the sky really is. Enjoy the moment, the Leonids are here, and they’re worth staying up for.","The Leonid meteor shower is active annually from around November 6 until November 30.

Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road that will carry Shah Rukh Khan ’s name and a life-size statue of the star at its entrance. The project, unveiled at a Mumbai event with Danube founder Rizwan Sajan and Shah Rukh Khan, is positioned as a landmark commercial address and is expected to be completed in the next 3–4 years.Shahrukhz (styled as Shahrukhz by Danube) is being promoted as a premium commercial and lifestyle tower on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai’s main business artery. Reports list it as a 55–56 storey development with more than one million sq ft of built-up space, a helipad, over 40 amenities (sky pool, business lounges, valet, etc.), and a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose at the entrance. The builder's marketing and press coverage place the finish date around 2029, a roughly three-to-four-year timeline.The newly unveiled skyscraper is more than just a name; it’s a massive commercial development positioned at a prime location. The building sits directly on Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai's main arterial corridor. The project carries a gross saleable value of approximately ₹4,000 crore (over $480 million) and will span more than 1 million square feet of built-up space.Marketed as a premium, Grade-A commercial destination, the tower stands 55 or 56 storeys tall.This landmark development is intended to be affordable for new businesses in Dubai, with commercial units starting at around $460,000. Construction is underway, and the developers are targeting a completion date by the second quarter of 2029.Danube Group is one of the UAE’s most recognisable home-grown business success stories, and the company behind the newly announced Shahrukhz tower. The group was founded in 1993 by Rizwan Sajan, an Indian-origin entrepreneur who arrived in Dubai with modest beginnings and grew a small trading shop into a multi-industry powerhouse.Over three decades, Sajan expanded Danube from a building-materials supplier into a diversified conglomerate with operations across the Middle East and Asia. His leadership style is often described as hands-on, ambitious and deeply relationship-driven, which has helped Danube build long-standing trust among suppliers, customers and partners.Today, Danube Group operates several major verticals, including building materials, home interiors, hospitality, façade systems and real estate but its most high-profile public face is Danube Properties, the development arm behind this new Shah Rukh Khan-named tower. Because the company originally started in building materials, Danube has an unusually deep supply-chain advantage in construction, allowing it to manage cost, quality and delivery with tighter control than many competitors.The grand launch event took place not in Dubai, but in Mumbai, hosted by the developers to appeal to Indian investors. Superstar Shah Rukh Khan graced the stage, alongside Danube Chairman Rizwan Sajan and filmmaker Farah Khan. The actor became visibly emotional while reflecting on the milestone, noting that his late mother would have been ""very happy"" about the honour. He shared a personal connection, expressing pride that he could tell his children, ""Papa's name is written here, this is Papa's building. ""In classic SRK style, he entertained the audience by recreating his iconic open-arm pose, performing the ""Don walk,"" and delivering his famous 'Om Shanti Om' dialogue. He also joked about his rare public appearances, quipping, ""I’ve become like the Eid moon. I am rarely seen, but when I appear, I look good."" Khan revealed that he was drawn to the project because it resonated with the idea of supporting people who come to a city with dreams of building their businesses and lives.The ""Shahrukhz by Danube"" tower is designed to be a unique experience, blending luxury commercial space with a tourist attraction dedicated to the star. It will boast more than 40 premium amenities for its occupants. The most distinctive feature will be a life-size statue of Shah Rukh Khan in his signature open-arms pose, located prominently at the entrance.The developers envision this entrance becoming a must-visit tourist destination, much like fans flock outside SRK's Mumbai residence, Mannat. Furthermore, the building’s cutting-edge design includes a helipad and is even expected to feature an air taxi station, a nod to Dubai’s futuristic transit plans. Danube Properties has confirmed that the name ""Shahrukhz"" is guaranteed to remain with this specific tower in perpetuity.","Dubai developer Danube Group has launched Shahrukhz by Danube, a premium commercial tower on Sheikh Zayed Road. The project, unveiled at a Mumbai event with Danube founder Rizwan Sajan and Shah Rukh Khan, is positioned as a landmark commercial address and is expected to be completed in the next 3–4 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125359560,imgsize-33182,width-400,resizemode-4/shahrukhz.jpg"

Will Dubai’s 20-minute city vision melt under extreme summer heat? Is there a plan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-dubais-20-minute-city-vision-melt-under-extreme-summer-heat-is-there-a-plan/articleshow/125317772.cms,"Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat (Representative Image)





How Expo City is tackling the heat



In winter: Encouraging walking through interactive, engaging spaces

In summer: Introducing climate-adapted solutions such as:



Climate-responsive urban design such as enclosed cool spaces Shaded walking routes Smart mobility hubs for bicycles and e-scooters Electric vehicles to support inclusive and multi-modal mobility



Don’t forget the old neighborhoods



Sustaining the vision: Making 20-minute cities work in the real world

Reduced traffic congestion

Improved quality of life

Lower carbon emissions

Greater walkability and livability





Dubai is pushing forward with its ambitious goal of building “20-minute cities”: neighborhoods where residents can access 80% of their daily needs, such as work, school, shops, and parks, within a 20-minute walk, bike ride, or public transport trip. This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.





When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries. The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric- enabled version of the traditional paper certificate. It uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125101750,imgsize-47068,width-400,resizemode-4/life-certificate-2025-step-by-step-guide-to-generate-and-submit-jeevan-pramaan-online-and-offline.jpg"

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

For years, the upper tier of American podcasting seemed immovable. News briefings, daily analysis and long-established storytelling shows dominated the charts, setting the tone for what millions listened to on their commutes, workouts and late-night wind-downs. But Apple ’s newly released 2025 rankings tell a different story. A familiar format has been pushed down, a new style has risen to the top and the country’s listening habits are shifting in ways that feel bigger than a simple list.Apple’s new list reveals a dramatic reshuffling, with familiar giants sliding down the chart and unexpected contenders rising to the top. What makes the change so striking is not only who climbed but what the shift says about how Americans are choosing to listen in 2025.At the centre of that shake-up is a new chart-topper: The Joe Rogan Experience.

Its ascent pushed long-time leader The Daily from The New York Times into second place, bringing an end to its years-long run at the top.Apple’s rankings confirm what industry watchers have sensed for months.

But the two firms have since revised their business agreements as OpenAI pursued alternative cloud and data-center partnerships with Oracle, SoftBank, and other infrastructure suppliers.The joint announcements from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came just before the kickoff of Microsoft’s annual Ignite developer conference.“This is all about deepening our commitment to bringing the best infrastructure, model choice and applications to our customers,” Nadella said during a video call with Amodei and Huang. He added that the collaboration builds on the “critical” relationship Microsoft continues to maintain with OpenAI.""10 PRINT ""ANTHROPIC + MICROSOFT + NVIDIA = MORE COMPUTE, COGNITION, AND CHOICE,"" wrote Nadella in a Twitter post.Microsoft said that it has committed to purchasing $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. As part of the broader arrangement, Nvidia will invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic, while Microsoft will contribute as much as $5 billion to the San Francisco–based company. Nvidia said the deal will give Anthropic access to up to a gigawatt of compute capacity powered by its advanced AI chips. “I’ve admired the work of Anthropic and Dario for a long time, and this is the first time we are going to deeply partner with Anthropic to accelerate Claude,” Huang said.Anthropic — founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees — said Claude will now be the “only frontier model” available across all three major cloud platforms: Amazon, its primary cloud partner; Google; and Microsoft. Both Anthropic and OpenAI continue to operate at heavy losses as training and running large AI systems demand vast amounts of energy and specialized hardware.",Microsoft has entered into a multibillion-dollar cloud infrastructure partnership with artificial intelligence startup Anthropic and chipmaker Nvidia.

Cloudflare down error message

What experts said on the outage







Cloudflare outage brought down hundreds of websites across the globe. Websites across the web crashed after what Cloudflare describes as a 'spike in unusual traffic.' The almost six-hour-long outage was caused by a latent bug. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides the infrastructure and security for many websites worldwide. One of the company’s main areas of service is protecting websites against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which occur when multiple bad actors flood a website or network with traffic requests to overload it and degrade performance or cut off access.Some of the biggest websites that went down include ChatGPT, Twitter, Perplexity, Claude and also the outage-tracking site DownDetector. Other online services, including Grindr, Uber, Canva, Spotify, NJ Transit and League of Legends also experienced issues during the outage.The cause of the outage was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic, Jackie Dutton, a Cloudflare spokesperson said in a statement. There was no evidence of a cyberattack or malicious activity, the statement said. “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services,” said Dutton.""In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack,” Knecht wrote, referring to a bug that goes undetected in testing and has not caused a failure,"" Cloudflare's chief technology officer Dane Knecht wrote on Twitter.Some sites displayed the error message, “Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.”Explaining Cloudflare outage, information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, Mike Chapple, said that Cloudflare works behind the scenes to make the internet faster and safer, but when problems flare up “it results in massive digital gridlock” for internet users. Chapple further added that Cloudflare is a “content delivery network” that takes content from 20% of the world’s websites and mirrors them on thousands of servers worldwide.“When you access a website protected by Cloudflare, your computer doesn’t connect directly to that site,” Chapple said. “Instead, it connects to the nearest Cloudflare server, which might be very close to your home. That protects the website from a flood of traffic, and it provides you with a faster response. It’s a win-win for everyone, until it fails, and 20% of the internet goes down at the same time.”",Cloudflare outage brought down hundreds of websites across the globe.
