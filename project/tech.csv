Where HAMMER fits in India’s precision strike ecosystem





India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. More than a new addition to the arsenal, HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare.Developed by France’s Safran Electronics & Defense, HAMMER is a modular precision strike system designed to hit targets from stand-off ranges while keeping aircraft outside heavily defended airspace. Its architecture combines guidance kits, propulsion and standard bomb bodies, allowing rapid adaptation across missions and platforms. The system is already combat-proven and integrated with aircraft such as the Rafale.Under a new agreement, Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, creating a common precision strike capability across both imported and home-grown fleets.At a time when air power is defined less by numbers and more by accuracy, stand-off reach and controlled escalation, the localisation of HAMMER signals a strategic shift from buying weapons to mastering precision strike technology itself.The Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER precision-guided weapons during Operation Sindoor on 7 May 2025 as part of a carefully calibrated cross-border strike against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22. A total of nine sites were struck, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s primary base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Weapon selection was central to the operation’s objectives. The Indian Air Force employed a layered mix of SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER precision-guided bombs and loitering munitions.Within this mix, HAMMER was used where flexibility and adaptability were essential. Its modular design and multiple guidance options allowed the IAF to tailor strikes based on the nature of individual targets and real-time assessments.HAMMER enabled stand-off engagement without requiring aircraft to fly directly over heavily defended areas. Its off-axis launch capability reduced exposure to Pakistan’s air defence network, particularly in areas close to population centres and sensitive military zones.The weapon’s precision supported the operation’s political and military messaging by reducing the risk of collateral damage. By pairing HAMMER with SCALP, the Indian Air Force demonstrated a layered strike doctrine, with SCALP neutralising deep, hardened targets and HAMMER engaging medium-range sites requiring precision and manoeuvrability.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, officially designated as AASM from the French Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.Despite often being described as a missile, HAMMER is fundamentally a guided bomb system. At its core is a standard unguided bomb, which becomes a high-precision strike weapon once fitted with modular guidance and propulsion kits. This design allows air forces to convert existing bomb inventories into modern precision weapons without developing entirely new missiles for each mission profile.The system is built around two main components. The first is a nose-mounted guidance section that determines how the weapon navigates and locks onto its target. Depending on the mission, this guidance kit can combine inertial navigation and GPS for all-weather strikes, infrared imaging for high-precision attacks on fixed targets, or laser guidance for engaging moving targets.The second component is a tail-mounted range extension kit, which includes a solid-fuel rocket booster and manoeuvrable winglets. Once released, the booster ignites to increase stand-off range, while the winglets allow the weapon to alter its flight path, perform sharp turns and attack targets from off-axis angles. In combat, this enables launch aircraft to remain outside heavily defended airspace while still striking accurately.HAMMER kits can be attached to bombs weighing 125 kilograms, 250 kilograms, 500 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, including widely used Mark 80 series bombs. This scalability allows the same weapon system to be used against a range of targets, from lightly protected structures to hardened bunkers.In operational use, HAMMER has demonstrated the ability to strike targets from significant distances, engage multiple targets in a single sortie and maintain accuracy in contested environments. Its combination of modularity, manoeuvrability and precision makes it particularly suited to modern air operations where speed, flexibility and controlled escalation are critical.In modern air warfare, weapons fall broadly into three categories: unguided bombs, guided bombs and air-to-surface missiles.Unguided bombs are cheap but inaccurate and require aircraft to fly directly over targets. Air-to-surface missiles offer long range and precision but are expensive and limited in numbers.HAMMER sits between these two extremes. It offers missile-like precision and stand-off range while retaining the flexibility and lower cost structure of a guided bomb.This distinction matters. Guided bombs like HAMMER allow air forces to carry larger numbers of precision weapons, adapt them to multiple target types and deploy them from a wide range of aircraft.The defining feature of HAMMER is modularity. Instead of designing a single fixed weapon, Safran developed a system where guidance, propulsion and bomb body can be mixed and matched.The nose-mounted guidance kit determines how the weapon finds and tracks its target. The rear-mounted range extension kit determines how far it can travel after release and how sharply it can manoeuvre.This modular architecture allows the same basic weapon to be used for close air support, deep strike, bunker busting and attacks on moving targets, depending on the guidance kit selected.For India, this means fewer weapon types to manage logistically while retaining operational flexibility.HAMMER is available in three primary guidance configurations.The baseline version combines an inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning System receiver. Data from both systems is fused using Kalman filtering, allowing the weapon to maintain accuracy even if GPS signals are degraded or jammed. This variant achieves a circular error probability of around 10 metres and works in all weather conditions.The second variant adds infrared homing to the INS and GPS combination. This system matches the target area with a reference image stored in the weapon’s memory, allowing accuracy of around one metre. It works day and night in fair weather and is particularly useful against fixed targets with a clear thermal signature.The third variant replaces infrared homing with laser guidance. This allows HAMMER to strike moving targets, provided they are illuminated by a laser designator from an aircraft, drone or ground team. This version was qualified in April 2013.These variants were redesignated in 2010 as SBU-38, SBU-64 and SBU-54 respectively, with the overall system renamed HAMMER for export.HAMMER’s range depends on launch altitude and configuration. Safran cites a range of over 32 nautical miles from high altitude and around 8 nautical miles from low-level release.The winglets and rocket booster allow off-axis launches of up to 90 degrees, meaning the aircraft does not have to point directly at the target. This reduces exposure to enemy air defences.Multiple HAMMER weapons can be released in a single pass against different targets with one trigger press, a capability that significantly enhances strike efficiency.HAMMER entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation on the Rafale platform.Its combat debut came in Afghanistan in April 2008, when a Rafale dropped two HAMMER weapons in support of ground troops.The system gained wider attention during the 2011 Libya campaign. A HAMMER weapon destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2 Galeb aircraft on the runway at Misrata Airport shortly after it landed. Another strike destroyed a Libyan tank at a distance of 55 kilometres. In total, 225 HAMMER weapons were used in Libya.This combat history is critical. Weapons that have been tested in real conflicts carry credibility in terms of reliability, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.India ordered large numbers of HAMMER weapons in September 2020. Deliveries were completed by November 2020, with the French Air and Space Force transferring part of its own stock to ensure immediate availability.The Indian Air Force initially integrated HAMMER on the Rafale fleet. Work has since begun to integrate it onto the Tejas, a process that involves complex software, avionics and flight control modifications.Successful integration on Tejas would represent a major step in combining imported high-end weapons with indigenous platforms.According to France’s Senate committee on defence manufacturing costs, the total cost of the AASM programme including development and delivery of 2,348 kits was €846 million, placing the per-weapon cost at around $300,000.Earlier figures showed a unit cost of €164,000 excluding development and €252,000 including development. By 2017, Safran reported a unit cost of €120,000 for the AASM Evolution version, with a target of reducing it to €80,000 through larger production runs.For India, domestic production offers the potential to lower costs over time while ensuring availability during crises.India today operates a layered precision strike inventory.Indigenous systems include the Sudarshan Laser Guided Bomb, the Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon, and glide bombs such as Gaurav and Garuthmaa.Imported and jointly developed systems include the SPICE series from Israel, HAMMER from France and the BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missile.HAMMER fills a crucial middle ground between short-range guided bombs and long-range cruise missiles, offering flexibility, precision and affordability.Manufacturing HAMMER in India is not just about supply security. It allows Indian engineers and technicians to gain deep familiarity with guidance systems, propulsion integration and precision strike workflows.This knowledge is transferable to future indigenous weapons programmes and reduces long-term dependence on foreign suppliers for upgrades and maintenance.The deal also strengthens India’s defence partnership with France at a time when New Delhi is diversifying beyond traditional suppliers.The BEL–Safran HAMMER joint venture represents a quiet but important shift in India’s approach to air warfare. Precision, modularity and adaptability are now central to how air power is conceived and deployed.By moving HAMMER production to Indian soil, New Delhi is not merely acquiring a weapon. It is acquiring the ability to understand, modify and eventually design the tools of modern precision strike warfare.","India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict.

Stars strike back at deepfakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stars-strike-back-at-deepfakes/articleshow/125982843.cms,"Chiranjeevi Lodges Complaint With Hyderabad Police Over AI-Generated Deepfake Videos

COURTS FRAMING PERSONALITY AS PRIVACY AND PUBLICITY TOGETHER

IN ABSENCE OF A STATUTE, JUDGES RELY ON MIX OF LAWS

As artificial intelligence (AI) usage gains traction so is the AI deepfakes menace. But celebrities, right from Tollywood to Bollywood film stars, are taking the bull by the horns, opting for the legal route to curb this menace.A string of civil suits filed recently by film actors like K Chiranjeevi and Akkineni Nagarjuna to Bollywood biggies like Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anil Kapoor show India’s sharpening legal response to AI-driven deepfakes, counterfeit merchandising and pornographic scams, putting personality rights at the centre of the entertainment economy.Taking violations seriously, courts too have been issuing swift injunctions to curb deepfakes and unlicensed endorsements that mislead audiences and dilute personal brand value.Across jurisdictions, judges are treating unauthorized AI images, manipulated videos and counterfeit merchandise as both privacy and publicity violations. Recent orders include “John Doe” (unknown person) injunctions against unidentified online offenders andtakedown directions to platforms, recognising a celebrity’s persona as commercially valuable and instantly associated with the star in the minds of fans, causing irreparable harm if misused.In Hyderabad, a city civil court order on September 26, 2025, protected K Chiranjeevi’s name, image, voice and well-known sobriquets such as “Mega Star”, “Chiru”, “Annayya”, “Boss” from unauthorized exploitation by over 30 online entities.The injunction extends to AI-generated content and the Metaverse, ruling that no T-shirts, posters, and deepfake videos be sold under his name without his consent. The Hyderabad cybercrime police also registered a case against porn sites circulating deep fake videos of the actor.In Delhi, a 2025 order in favour of Akkineni Nagarjunarestrained dozens of obscene websites and merchandisers from using his “name, image, persona and voice”. The court relied on recent Delhi High Court (HC) precedents, including suits involving Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, to order disabling of URLs and barring sale of merchandise bearing their likenesses.Where does consent end? The Hyderabad Biker’s Case But not all disputes are being raised by the film fraternity. A famous Hyderabad-based biker filed a suit in a local court after she discovered her photograph, originally given to a women riders’ group for promoting International Female Riders Day, was altered and allegedly used by an Indian bike firm for advertising without consent.Her image was allegedly manipulated to replace a Harley Davidson motorcycle with an Indian bike brand in the advertisement. The case, pending before an additional chief judge in a Ranga Reddy court, underscores how misuse of likeness affects everyone. The plaintiff’s original permission was for one event, but the image found its way into a corporate campaign, revealing how easily digital assets can be exploited without authorisation.Legal experts say though India has no specific laws for personality rights, courts are using constitutional privacy, intellectual property doctrines and information-technology and criminal provisions (identity theft, obscenity) to order removal of content and deter further misuse.The Supreme Court’s privacy jurisprudence, from R Rajagopal v Tamil Nadu in 1994 underpins this patchwork, while high courts have built a pragmatic framework through interim orders in series of suits filed by celebrities.Intellectual property (IP) expert Ashok Ram Kumar says personality rights cases have become an important tool for celebrities seeking to protect their identity from misuse, economic exploitation and loss of dignity caused by AI deepfakes.“As identity theft turns into a profitable digital enterprise, courts, though operating without a specific law, have started treating a celebrity’s identity as a form of IP. This helps prevent unauthorised use of their name, likeness or voice and paves the way for broader protection of individual identity in the future,” he says.Delhi HC has led in speed and scope, ordering fast takedowns of deepfakes and fake profiles while leaving room for bona fide speech like satire and fan pages. Other courts, including Madras HC, Hyderabad HC and Bombay HC, have passed similar, often ex parte, injunctions balancing a celebrity’s drawing power and livelihood against the public’s speech rights.","A string of civil suits filed recently by film actors like K Chiranjeevi and Akkineni Nagarjuna to Bollywood biggies like Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anil Kapoor show India’s sharpening legal response to AI-driven deepfakes.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects. “Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Cuban says smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Facebook Messenger’s desktop app shuts down on Mac and Windows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/facebook-messengers-desktop-app-shuts-down-on-mac-and-windows/articleshow/125994661.cms,"Why Messenger’s desktop app was retired



Shift to web-based messaging







Facebook-parent Meta has officially discontinued the Facebook Messenger desktop app for Mac and Windows. The app is now redirecting the users to Facebook website and Messenger.com if they want to use the service. The shut down to the Messenger app marks the end of a product that was launched during the COVID-19 pandemic but struggled to compete with other business-focused rivals such as zoom. The company informed about the app shutdown in October this year. AppleInsider reported that starting December 15, users will start receiving in-app notifications about the shutdown, with a 60-day window to transition before being blocked from using the apps. Meta is also urging the users to delete the desktop apps once they become unusable.“The Messenger app for Mac is being deprecated. After deprecation, you won’t be able to log into this app and will be automatically redirected to use Facebook website for messaging,” reads the support page.* The app lacked features such as screensharing and support for large video call groups, limiting its appeal compared to competitors.* Meta had already begun merging Messenger back into the Facebook app in 2023, signaling a reduced focus on standalone desktop experiences.* On Mac, Messenger was built using Apple’s Catalyst framework, which faced criticism for requiring extra developer work and producing apps that didn’t feel fully native.* On Windows, the app transitioned to a progressive web app last year, further reducing demand for a dedicated desktop versionThe decision to discontinue the Messenger app for Mac and Windows is followed by Meta’s earlier transition to Progressive Web App (PWA) in September 2024, signaling a broader shift toward browser-based experiences. However, Windows users can still use the Facebook desktop app, both Mac and Windows users are now said to access Messenger via Facebook.com.In to make the transition process smooth, Meta has advised users to activate secure storage for chat history, set up PIN to protect encrypted messages and also confirm settings under Privacy and safety > End-to-End Encrypted Chats > Message Storage. Once secure storage is enabled, chat history will remain accessible across platforms.The decision of Meta to shut down the Messenger app is likely to disappoint users who preferred the convenience of a dedicated desktop app, especially for multitasking and work-related communication. However, Meta says the web version will continue to support core features, including encrypted messaging and media sharing.","Facebook-parent Meta has officially discontinued the Facebook Messenger desktop app for Mac and Windows.

Washington: Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called “slop”. The word’s proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster’s 2025 word of the year. “It’s such an illustrative word,” said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster’s president ahead of Monday’s announcement. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.”“Slop” was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence”. In other words, “you know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,” Barlow said.AI video generators have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now — and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend US military actions in Venezuela.The Canadian animated show “Franklin” teaches about kindness, empathy and inclusivity — but in Hegseth’s hands, its main character became a tool to promote violence. The word “slop” evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew.To select the word of the year, the dictionary’s editors review data about which words have risen in searches and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year. “We like to think that we are a mirror for people,” Barlow said.","Merriam-Webster names'slop' as its word of the year for 2025.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money. On seeing this, the Speaker quipped, “There are 10 notes, yet 12 owners.” Proceedings were briefly halted amid the laughter and confusion.A video of the episode went viral on social media, with many Pakistanis mocking their lawmakers. According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

Where HAMMER fits in India’s precision strike ecosystem









India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict. More than a new addition to the arsenal, HAMMER represents a move away from importing finished munitions towards absorbing the technologies that define modern air warfare.Developed by France’s Safran Electronics & Defense, HAMMER is a modular precision strike system designed to hit targets from stand-off ranges while keeping aircraft outside heavily defended airspace. Its architecture combines guidance kits, propulsion and standard bomb bodies, allowing rapid adaptation across missions and platforms. The system is already combat-proven and integrated with aircraft such as the Rafale.Under a new agreement, Bharat Electronics Limited and Safran will jointly manufacture, customise, supply and maintain HAMMER in India through a 50-50 joint venture. The weapon will be integrated across multiple platforms, including the Rafale and the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, creating a common precision strike capability across both imported and home-grown fleets.At a time when air power is defined less by numbers and more by accuracy, stand-off reach and controlled escalation, the localisation of HAMMER signals a strategic shift from buying weapons to mastering precision strike technology itself.The Indian Air Force deployed HAMMER precision-guided weapons during Operation Sindoor on 7 May 2025 as part of a carefully calibrated cross-border strike against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22. A total of nine sites were struck, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s primary base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke.Weapon selection was central to the operation’s objectives. The Indian Air Force employed a layered mix of SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER precision-guided bombs and loitering munitions.Within this mix, HAMMER was used where flexibility and adaptability were essential. Its modular design and multiple guidance options allowed the IAF to tailor strikes based on the nature of individual targets and real-time assessments.HAMMER enabled stand-off engagement without requiring aircraft to fly directly over heavily defended areas. Its off-axis launch capability reduced exposure to Pakistan’s air defence network, particularly in areas close to population centres and sensitive military zones.The weapon’s precision supported the operation’s political and military messaging by reducing the risk of collateral damage. By pairing HAMMER with SCALP, the Indian Air Force demonstrated a layered strike doctrine, with SCALP neutralising deep, hardened targets and HAMMER engaging medium-range sites requiring precision and manoeuvrability.HAMMER, short for Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range, officially designated as AASM from the French Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, is a precision-guided air-to-ground stand-off weapon designed to bridge the gap between conventional bombs and cruise missiles.Despite often being described as a missile, HAMMER is fundamentally a guided bomb system. At its core is a standard unguided bomb, which becomes a high-precision strike weapon once fitted with modular guidance and propulsion kits. This design allows air forces to convert existing bomb inventories into modern precision weapons without developing entirely new missiles for each mission profile.The system is built around two main components. The first is a nose-mounted guidance section that determines how the weapon navigates and locks onto its target. Depending on the mission, this guidance kit can combine inertial navigation and GPS for all-weather strikes, infrared imaging for high-precision attacks on fixed targets, or laser guidance for engaging moving targets.The second component is a tail-mounted range extension kit, which includes a solid-fuel rocket booster and manoeuvrable winglets. Once released, the booster ignites to increase stand-off range, while the winglets allow the weapon to alter its flight path, perform sharp turns and attack targets from off-axis angles. In combat, this enables launch aircraft to remain outside heavily defended airspace while still striking accurately.HAMMER kits can be attached to bombs weighing 125 kilograms, 250 kilograms, 500 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, including widely used Mark 80 series bombs. This scalability allows the same weapon system to be used against a range of targets, from lightly protected structures to hardened bunkers.In operational use, HAMMER has demonstrated the ability to strike targets from significant distances, engage multiple targets in a single sortie and maintain accuracy in contested environments. Its combination of modularity, manoeuvrability and precision makes it particularly suited to modern air operations where speed, flexibility and controlled escalation are critical.In modern air warfare, weapons fall broadly into three categories: unguided bombs, guided bombs and air-to-surface missiles.Unguided bombs are cheap but inaccurate and require aircraft to fly directly over targets. Air-to-surface missiles offer long range and precision but are expensive and limited in numbers.HAMMER sits between these two extremes. It offers missile-like precision and stand-off range while retaining the flexibility and lower cost structure of a guided bomb.This distinction matters. Guided bombs like HAMMER allow air forces to carry larger numbers of precision weapons, adapt them to multiple target types and deploy them from a wide range of aircraft.The defining feature of HAMMER is modularity. Instead of designing a single fixed weapon, Safran developed a system where guidance, propulsion and bomb body can be mixed and matched.The nose-mounted guidance kit determines how the weapon finds and tracks its target. The rear-mounted range extension kit determines how far it can travel after release and how sharply it can manoeuvre.This modular architecture allows the same basic weapon to be used for close air support, deep strike, bunker busting and attacks on moving targets, depending on the guidance kit selected.For India, this means fewer weapon types to manage logistically while retaining operational flexibility.HAMMER is available in three primary guidance configurations.The baseline version combines an inertial navigation system and a Global Positioning System receiver. Data from both systems is fused using Kalman filtering, allowing the weapon to maintain accuracy even if GPS signals are degraded or jammed. This variant achieves a circular error probability of around 10 metres and works in all weather conditions.The second variant adds infrared homing to the INS and GPS combination. This system matches the target area with a reference image stored in the weapon’s memory, allowing accuracy of around one metre. It works day and night in fair weather and is particularly useful against fixed targets with a clear thermal signature.The third variant replaces infrared homing with laser guidance. This allows HAMMER to strike moving targets, provided they are illuminated by a laser designator from an aircraft, drone or ground team. This version was qualified in April 2013.These variants were redesignated in 2010 as SBU-38, SBU-64 and SBU-54 respectively, with the overall system renamed HAMMER for export.HAMMER’s range depends on launch altitude and configuration. Safran cites a range of over 32 nautical miles from high altitude and around 8 nautical miles from low-level release.The winglets and rocket booster allow off-axis launches of up to 90 degrees, meaning the aircraft does not have to point directly at the target. This reduces exposure to enemy air defences.Multiple HAMMER weapons can be released in a single pass against different targets with one trigger press, a capability that significantly enhances strike efficiency.HAMMER entered service in 2007 with the French Air Force and Naval Aviation on the Rafale platform.Its combat debut came in Afghanistan in April 2008, when a Rafale dropped two HAMMER weapons in support of ground troops.The system gained wider attention during the 2011 Libya campaign. A HAMMER weapon destroyed a Libyan Air Force G-2 Galeb aircraft on the runway at Misrata Airport shortly after it landed. Another strike destroyed a Libyan tank at a distance of 55 kilometres. In total, 225 HAMMER weapons were used in Libya.This combat history is critical. Weapons that have been tested in real conflicts carry credibility in terms of reliability, accuracy and resistance to countermeasures.India ordered large numbers of HAMMER weapons in September 2020. Deliveries were completed by November 2020, with the French Air and Space Force transferring part of its own stock to ensure immediate availability.The Indian Air Force initially integrated HAMMER on the Rafale fleet. Work has since begun to integrate it onto the Tejas, a process that involves complex software, avionics and flight control modifications.Successful integration on Tejas would represent a major step in combining imported high-end weapons with indigenous platforms.According to France’s Senate committee on defence manufacturing costs, the total cost of the AASM programme including development and delivery of 2,348 kits was €846 million, placing the per-weapon cost at around $300,000.Earlier figures showed a unit cost of €164,000 excluding development and €252,000 including development. By 2017, Safran reported a unit cost of €120,000 for the AASM Evolution version, with a target of reducing it to €80,000 through larger production runs.For India, domestic production offers the potential to lower costs over time while ensuring availability during crises.India today operates a layered precision strike inventory.Indigenous systems include the Sudarshan Laser Guided Bomb, the Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon, and glide bombs such as Gaurav and Garuthmaa.Imported and jointly developed systems include the SPICE series from Israel, HAMMER from France and the BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missile.HAMMER fills a crucial middle ground between short-range guided bombs and long-range cruise missiles, offering flexibility, precision and affordability.Manufacturing HAMMER in India is not just about supply security. It allows Indian engineers and technicians to gain deep familiarity with guidance systems, propulsion integration and precision strike workflows.This knowledge is transferable to future indigenous weapons programmes and reduces long-term dependence on foreign suppliers for upgrades and maintenance.The deal also strengthens India’s defence partnership with France at a time when New Delhi is diversifying beyond traditional suppliers.The BEL–Safran HAMMER joint venture represents a quiet but important shift in India’s approach to air warfare. Precision, modularity and adaptability are now central to how air power is conceived and deployed.By moving HAMMER production to Indian soil, New Delhi is not merely acquiring a weapon. It is acquiring the ability to understand, modify and eventually design the tools of modern precision strike warfare.","India’s decision to manufacture the HAMMER precision-guided air-to-ground weapon marks a quiet but consequential shift in how New Delhi is preparing for future conflict.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting with the launch of its first licensed internet gaming and sports wagering website. The platform, called Play971, is officially authorised and regulated by the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), the federal body responsible for supervising all commercial gaming activity in the country.Play971 is operated by Coin Technology Projects LLC, a firm incorporated in Abu Dhabi with its main base at Twofour54 Yas Creative Hub, and claims to be fully “located, licensed and regulated in the UAE.” This launch marks a significant milestone for a country that has long been known for strict anti-gambling laws rooted in cultural and religious norms.Play971’s debut represents more than just a new website. It introduces a regulated environment for real-money online games and sports wagering that did not exist before under UAE law. The platform includes a range of casino-style games and sports betting markets, including popular events like football and tennis.Under the supervision of the GCGRA, players and operators must follow strict responsible gaming standards, including systems to verify user identity and ensure that only eligible participants within the UAE can access the service. This controlled launch currently applies in certain emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah, with broader availability expected in early 2026 as the regulatory framework and licensing system evolves.This early rollout serves as a test case for future operators, and regulators continue to refine licensing categories, supplier approvals and compliance rules so that the market expands safely and transparently.The UAE’s move toward regulated online gaming builds on multiple earlier steps. In 2024, the first official lottery licence was awarded to The Game LLC, beginning regulated draw operations with major prizes.According to the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), internet gaming is considered a form of “commercial gaming conducted via the internet, using computers, mobile phones, or other digital devices with access to websites or apps that offer games and bets involving chance, skill, or a combination of both.” The regulator notes that these games include bingo, casino games such as slots and poker, eSports, fantasy games, peer-to-peer games, skill-based games, sports betting, and more.On sports wagering specifically, the GCGRA explains that it “involves betting on the outcome of sports events or the performance of athletes or teams,” and that wagers can only be placed legally through licensed operators and sportsbooks.Separately, the GCGRA has also issued:Together, these moves show the UAE modernising its commercial gaming landscape with a regulated, consumer-safe framework rather than a permissive or unregulated market.At launch, Play971 is accessible primarily through its official website, rather than via public app stores. Users can register and play directly online, following identity verification and eligibility checks required by the UAE’s gaming regulator.As of now, no standalone mobile app has been publicly listed on major platforms such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This cautious approach aligns with the UAE’s tightly controlled regulatory rollout, ensuring compliance with responsible gaming and digital licensing standards before wider distribution.According to industry observers and regulatory context shared in official announcements, any future mobile app rollout, whether on iOS or Android, would require separate approvals from the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), as well as compliance with platform-specific policies.The availability of Play971 is also being introduced in phases, with access currently aligned to emirates and jurisdictions where regulatory readiness has been confirmed, including Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah. Wider nationwide access is expected to follow only after regulators complete further reviews of system performance, consumer safeguards, and operational compliance.Officials have stressed that users should avoid unlicensed apps or websites claiming to offer UAE-approved betting services, as Play971 remains the only legally licensed online sports wagering and iGaming platform in the country at this stage.With the national lottery, casino-resort projects, vendor license and now Play971, the UAE is slowly but deliberately building a regulated commercial gaming ecosystem that is secure and transparent for consumers and operators alike.","The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting.

Saudi Arabia introduces ID Wristband Devices for child safety during Hajj and Umrah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-introduces-id-wristband-devices-for-child-safety-during-hajj-and-umrah/articleshow/125971558.cms,"Makkah Grand Mosque rolls out child safety bracelets / AI Generated Image

How do Child ID bracelets work?

Pilgrim safety during Hajj 2026

What should parents do?





The General Authority for the Care of the Grand Mosque and the Prophet’s Mosque in Saudi Arabia has launched a new child safety initiative at the holy site in Makkah this December. Under this programme, identification bracelets for children are now being issued to families as they enter the Grand Mosque complex. The goal is simple but powerful: ensure young pilgrims are quickly recognised and reunited with their guardians if they become lost or separated in the crowds.This initiative extends earlier versions of child wristband systems that were trialled and operated at key entrances in previous Umrah and Hajj seasons.The child safety bracelets are provided free of charge to families visiting the Grand Mosque with children. There is no online pre-registration required and no payment involved at any stage.Parents or guardians can obtain the bracelets on arrival at the Grand Mosque, where dedicated counters have been set up at key entry gates, including the King Abdulaziz Gate and King Fahd Gate (Gate 79). Trained staff from the mosque authority assist families at these points.The registration process is quick and done on the spot. Guardians are asked to provide basic contact details, such as a mobile phone number, which is then recorded on the bracelet.The bracelet is securely fastened to the child’s wrist before entry, ensuring the child can be easily identified if separated from their family.There is no age restriction specified, but the initiative is primarily aimed at young children, who are more vulnerable in dense crowds during Umrah and Hajj. Authorities strongly advise families with children to collect the bracelet before entering the prayer areas, especially during peak hours.Mosque officials have reiterated that the service is part of broader crowd-management and safety measures, and families are encouraged to use it as a preventive step rather than waiting for an emergency.The initiative is strongly encouraged for all guardians to utilize, especially during peak seasons when visitor numbers surge, such as the Holy Month of Ramadan and the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Authorities note that the system has successfully reduced reports of missing persons during these congested periods.Speaking on the objective of the program, officials have emphasized the importance of the service. Eng. Amjad Al-Hazmi, Deputy Head of the Presidency for Social and Voluntary Services, highlighted the organization’s ""utmost keenness on the provision of the finest and best services for the pilgrims"" and its commitment to ""raise the level of social responsibility."" Similarly, Khalid bin Fahad Al-Shalawi, Undersecretary-General for Social, Voluntary and Humanitarian Services, stated that the initiative ""supports parents and their children to perform their rituals peacefully. ""By providing this safety net, the Authority aims to give parents peace of mind, allowing them to focus fully on their spiritual obligations without the constant worry of losing their child in the crowd.Saudi authorities advise parents not to panic if a child becomes separated inside the Grand Mosque. With the safety bracelet in place, the recovery process is designed to be quick and orderly.If a child goes missing, parents should immediately inform the nearest security officer or mosque staff member and provide a description of the child. Staff are trained to look for the ID bracelet, which allows them to contact guardians directly using the information provided.Lost children are typically taken to designated assistance points inside the mosque complex, where trained personnel care for them until parents arrive. Authorities stress that most separations are resolved within a short time due to the coordinated system in place.This guidance helps parents understand that the bracelet works as part of a larger safety network, not as a standalone measure.Together with these innovations, the child bracelet programme reflects Saudi Arabia’s ongoing commitment to enhancing visitor experience while preserving safety, tradition, and hospitality at one of the world’s most sacred sites.","Saudi authorities have launched a new child safety initiative at the Grand Mosque in Makkah.

“The reason I was given was for violating the child safety policy. This obviously never happened..this was likely YouTube’s new AI moderation going haywire”

AI moderation backlash and a rising preoccupation with creators





YouTube commentator AugieRFC alleged that his entire channel on YouTube temporarily got shut down because of a false report under the child safety policy. The content creator went online to inform followers on social media platforms of an impact on his personal Google account with a different email altogether. AugieRFC noted this must have 'obviously' been a bug in YouTube’s new AI-powered moderations tool and stated in a message,Such an event is a manifestation of an emerging trend of false strikes and incorrect strikes targeting content creators under an automated enforcement system on the ‪YouTube‬ platform. Several commentary channels and gaming content providers have indicated strikes, impacted capabilities, and/or complete deletion of channels with non-violative content. Such strikes are conducted without human intervention. Such an event brings forth challenges faced by independent content providers on a platform they derive income from.In 2025, YouTube added AI-powered content moderation capabilities for five tasks: age verification, child safety, scam content, and ‘AI slop,' referring to AI-generated content.Although this technology aims to quickly identify threatening content, it is widely criticized because these algorithms tend to produce a high volume of false-positive results.The suspension of AugieRFC is not an isolated case but a continuation of experiences other content creators have encountered unfairly being penalized by the AI algorithm. False child safety allegations are particularly problematic because they pose a high reputational consequence to content creators, regardless of whether this action is reversed by YouTube in the future.Well over 50,000 content creators have voiced their discontent with these enforcement algorithms. However, YouTube has not yet commented on this growing pattern of complaints related to AI moderation, leaving channels such as AugieRFC uncertain about their fate. Right now, this community of commenters is waiting to see if a change will come to YouTube and if they can quickly regain their channels if an error occurs.Also Read: MoistCr1TiKaL reviews The Game Awards 2025 while downplaying his own win",YouTube commentator AugieRFC alleged that his entire channel on YouTube temporarily got shut down because of a false report under the child safety policy.

999: For all life-threatening emergencies.

901: For non-emergency reports or inquiries.

Driving rules and fines

Reduce Speed: Motorists must slow down immediately. Wet roads significantly increase braking distance and the risk of aquaplaning (skidding). Driving in foggy weather without turning on vehicle lights can incur an AED 400 fine and four black points.

400 fine and four black points. Increase Distance: Maintain a sufficient safety gap. The standard three-second rule should be increased to a minimum of five seconds between your vehicle and the one ahead.

Use Proper Lighting: Turn on low-beam headlights and use fog lights when visibility drops. Never use high beams, as the light reflects off the water droplets or fog, reducing visibility for everyone.

Check Your Car: Before setting out, verify that your tires, brakes, and headlights are working properly. Crucially, ensure your windshield wipers are functional and the washer fluid tank is full.

Stay Focused: Maintain full attention on the road at all times.Taking photos or filming the rain while driving is a serious violation resulting in an AED 800 fine and four black points.

Mandatory water safety

Avoid Flood Zones: Residents must stay clear of valleys (Wadis), water channels, and any areas prone to flash floods. The depth and force of moving water are often misjudged; it can take less than 12 inches of rapidly moving water to sweep a car away. AED 1,000 fine and six black points for gathering near valleys and flood zones.



Do Not Go Near the Sea: The public is strongly advised to avoid beaches and to refrain from any sailing or marine activities. Rough seas and strong waves can pose severe threats to even experienced sea-goers. Driving into a closed road or flooded valley, ignoring the instructions of the competent authority, results in an AED 2,000 fine, 23 black points, and 60 days of vehicle impoundment.



Marine Vessels: Owners and operators of boats, ships, and yachts are urged to closely monitor the latest weather forecasts and strictly comply with all issued navigation and safety instructions before considering setting sail.





On the evening of Saturday, 13 December 2025, the Dubai Police General Command issued a public safety alert to everyone in the emirate.

Residents are called upon to drive with extreme care and follow official guidance as the situation evolves.For immediate assistance during the weather event, the police have designated two critical contact lines:Unstable weather, be it heavy rain, low visibility, or sudden dust storms, significantly increases the risk of accidents on the road. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) and Dubai Police have issued specific, non-negotiable guidelines for motorists:Must-follow driving checklist:The greatest immediate danger during periods of intense rainfall is the risk of sudden flash flooding and strong marine currents.Official warnings strictly prohibit any travel into low-lying, water-prone areas.While authorities like the Dubai Police and the RTA are fully prepared to manage emergencies, the most effective defense against adverse weather begins with you.

Parkin Company PJSC, Dubai’s largest provider of paid parking facilities, confirmed it is aware of the incident. In a statement shared with, the company said all identified fraudulent QR codes have been removed. It also said that any QR codes that were misused have been updated to redirect users to the official Roads and Transport Authority website.Scammers typically place fake stickers over legitimate QR codes on parking signboards, making the tampering difficult to detect at first glance.

What the new law does for child rights?

Prioritizes “the best interests of the child” in care, custody, and upbringing decisions.

Creates an integrated care system that coordinates social, health, educational and psychological support for each child.

Protects children’s identity and privacy, helping them integrate positively into society, grow with dignity, and avoid stigma associated with their origins.

Child protection in the UAE

Ensuring access to essential services and opportunities regardless of a child’s parental status.

Standardizing care protocols so authorities and caregivers follow a unified, child-first approach across the nation.

Promoting integration into society, helping children grow with dignity, identity and opportunities equal to other residents.

UAE and ongoing initiatives





The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage, that is, children whose biological parents are not legally identified or known. This law strengthens how the country cares for vulnerable children and ensures they grow up in safe, stable environments.The decree is part of the UAE’s ongoing efforts to update its child welfare framework following decades of legislative activity, including the existing Child Rights Law (formerly known as Wadeema’s Law).The new law reframes how children without known parents are cared for and supported. It does the following:Under the reform, all important decisions involving these children must fully reflect their physical, emotional, and social needs, including access to education, healthcare, and a secure family environment.This law builds on the existing Child Rights Law (Federal Law No. 3 of 2016), which already guarantees a broad set of protections for all children in the UAE, including protection from neglect, abuse, exploitation and discrimination.Children with unknown parentage often face complex legal and social challenges, such as lack of documentation, unclear affiliation, and difficulty accessing services. The new law aims to remove these barriers by:Experts welcomed the move as a logical continuation of the UAE’s child welfare strategy, which prioritizes safety, health, education and emotional development for all children, from newborns to teenagers.The new law aligns with other efforts in the UAE to strengthen child rights and safety. The Child Rights Law (Wadeema’s Law) already protects children against abuse, neglect, and psychological harm, and places priority on family and safe environments for children.Local forums and initiatives, such as the Child Safety Forum in Sharjah, bring authorities and experts together to promote best practices in child protection. Updated personal status and family laws in the UAE have also placed children’s welfare at the heart of legal reforms, including custody, support and identity issues.These developments show the UAE is working on multiple fronts to create a comprehensive child protection ecosystem, not just for children with known families but also for the most vulnerable who lack parental identity.The UAE’s Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025 marks a significant step in modernizing and strengthening child protection laws. By focusing on the best interests of children with unknown parents, and ensuring stable care, rights, and opportunity, the country reinforces its long-standing commitment to children’s welfare and social inclusion.","The UAE Government has issued Federal Decree-Law No. (12) of 2025, a major legal reform focused on children of unknown parentage.

RTA's immediate traffic impact

Why the work is happening?

Alternative roads and diversion

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area.

(E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area. Sheikh Zayed Road (E11): While a much busier and more central route, the E11 runs closer to the coast and is often used as a long-distance alternative, particularly for those heading toward Jebel Ali Port or Abu Dhabi.

Dubai–Al Ain Road (E66): For traffic approaching the E611 from the eastern side of Dubai, the E66 serves as a critical connector. If the specific exit loops at the E611/Lehbab intersection are closed, drivers are advised to continue on the E66 and utilize the next available exit or interchange to double back or access local roads.

Al Yalayes Road (D57): This road is a high-capacity link, especially vital for commercial traffic moving from Jebel Ali Port and the surrounding Free Zone. It can be used to connect traffic between the Sheikh Zayed Road (E11) and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311), effectively bypassing the core E611 work zone.





From Thursday, 11 December 2025, authorities will temporarily close the slip-road at Bridge No. 7 on Emirates Road for vehicles travelling from Ras Al Khaimah towards Al Dhaid. Motorists affected by the closure are being asked to use nearby alternatives such as Bridge No. 6 and the recently opened Khorfakkan Road Tunnel while the work is under way. The closure and diversion were publicly announced as part of traffic advisories issued on December 10.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611). The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.The work began on December 11, 2025, and was deemed essential to facilitate the complex construction required for a major upgrade project. Commuters traveling north on E611 who needed to exit at this point were immediately impacted and directed to use the newly implemented diversion routes signaled by the RTA.This closure is part of wider, phased improvements to the Emirates Road (E611) corridor designed to boost capacity and safety on one of the UAE’s main arterial routes.The stretch has been targeted for lane and interchange upgrades in a larger Dh750 million expansion plan launched earlier in 2025 that aims to increase lane capacity on key segments, shorten commute times and ease congestion for drivers travelling between Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, Sharjah and Dubai.That expansion includes widening lanes and upgrading interchange No. 7 with multiple new bridges, work planned to increase throughput and cut travel times sharply for long-distance commuters.For commuters whose primary route involves the E611 and requires an exit into the southern or western Dubai areas, several major arterial roads serve as primary alternatives, depending on the traveler's starting point:These detours were strategically planned to reroute vehicles around the construction zone, maintaining access to the critical roads which link key economic and residential districts, thus minimizing long-term disruption. This vital junction connects the major Emirates Road (E611) with the Jebel Ali-Lehbab Road and Al Qudra Road, making its smooth operation essential for the entire southern corridor of Dubai.",The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611) The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125889079,imgsize-37730,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-traffic.jpg"

Some pointed out the technicalities that go into human bodies in the times of modern medial science.A user said: ""So if a woman has a hysterectomy she isn’t a woman anymore?""Another said: ""Actually, this is not true, because there are women with MRKH syndrome (Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome), in which the uterus is absent or underdeveloped from birth.""""You keep trying and failing to make this point. Maybe stick with counting your cash and leave the thinking to others? This isn’t true.

It may be performed for medical reasons such as uterine fibroids, heavy bleeding, cancer, endometriosis, or chronic pain. Depending on the case, the surgery can also involve removing the cervix, ovaries, or fallopian tubes. After a hysterectomy, a woman can no longer become pregnant, and the procedure may be done through the abdomen, vagina, or using minimally invasive techniques.","The Tesla CEO posted on X: ""If you have a womb you are a woman.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.
