"Shux, crew, study microalgae, cancer, cognition & more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shux-crew-study-microalgae-cancer-cognition-more/articleshow/122168832.cms,"The view was still extraordinary, but the work, even more so for the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crew. With Earth turning silently below them, the crew, including India’s Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux) spent their third day aboard the International Space Station (ISS) studying cancer, cognition, microalgae, the building blocks of long-term spaceflight, and more.The experiments being carried out by Shux and other crew members are part of the more than 60 scientific investigations from 31 countries, including India, the US, Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. After all, Ax-4 is the most research-intensive private mission to the ISS to date.Shux, who had kicked off his research activity with a muscle loss study the previous day, was hard at work on a project that’s microscopic in size but potentially massive in impact. He deployed sample bags and imaging tools for a space microalgae experiment, studying how these tiny organisms fare in orbit.Rich in nutrients and capable of recycling carbon dioxide, microalgae could become a key part of long-duration space missions — a source of food, oxygen and life support rolled into one. He was also part of, along with other AX-4 crew, the “Neuro Motion VR” study, which uses virtual reality headsets and brain-monitoring technology (fNIRS) to observe how astronauts’ cognitive and motor functions respond to spaceflight.“Alongside that, they collected data for ‘Telemetric Health AI’, a project that merges biometric tracking with AI analytics to better understand how spaceflight affects the cardiovascular and balance systems. These studies aren’t just academic. They’re building the foundations for safe, extended human missions into deep space,” Axiom Space said.Commander Peggy Whitson, a seasoned astronaut on her fourth spaceflight, devoted much of the day to the Cancer in LEO (low-Earth orbit) investigation. Working with the Sanford Stem Cell Institute, she captured imaging samples of cancer cells exposed to microgravity. The stress of space may change the way these cells behave, potentially offering clues to tackling aggressive, metastatic cancers back on Earth.Her camera didn’t stop there. Whitson also photographed student-designed science experiments and artwork for the Saudi Space Agency’s Microgravity Challenge — a competition that drew over 80,000 entries from young innovators across the Arab world. With submissions ranging from sustainable farming ideas to space-inspired art, it’s an example of how missions like Ax-4 can inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and dreamers.Mission specialist Suave (Slawosz Uznanski) focused his attention on the microfluidic design experiment to observe how fluids behave in low gravity. The end goal? Developing microfluidic devices that test drug stability and quality — a vital step toward bringing autonomous health care to future space travellers.And yet, research isn’t the only focus. The crew also reached out to Earth. Tibor Kapu shared a live conversation with Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán, while Whitson and Suave spoke with Axiom Space Chief Scientist Dr Lucie Low about protecting astronauts from space radiation — a challenge no future mission can ignore.","The Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crew spent their third day aboard the International Space Station (ISS) studying cancer, cognition, microalgae, the building blocks of long-term spaceflight, and more.

Poll Do you think the new USCIS text message number will help reduce confusion? No Yes

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311). Our new number will be 872466 (USAIMM),” USCIS said in a press statement. This change is aimed at helping users easily recognize official messages from the immigration agency.Starting July 1, 2026, the agency will no longer use its current number, 468311 (GOV311). As announced by the immigration agency, its new number will be 872466, which spells out USAIMM, reflecting the agency’s focus on immigration services.The change is important for people who receive text updates from USCIS – such as case status alerts, appointment reminders or other notifications. USCIS advises users to save its new number – 872466 in their contacts to avoid confusion or mistaking the messages for spam.Having said that, there is no change in the type of messages sent. The agency will continue to use text alerts to update applicants about their case status.In a related news, the USCIS has issued a strong warning for immigrants, saying that green cards and visas will be revoked if a person breaks the law. In a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter), USCIS shared an image that read: “Green cards and visas will be revoked if an alien breaks the law.” The agency said it will cancel green cards and visas for people found guilty of serious crimes, like supporting or promoting terrorism,a stark reminder that staying in the US is a conditional privilege, not a guaranteed right.In its X post, the US immigration agency stated: “Coming to America and receiving a visa or green card is a privilege.

"What is China's mosquito drone? Capable of capturing images, audio & electronic signals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/what-is-chinas-mosquito-drone-capable-of-capturing-images-audio-electronic-signals-details/articleshow/122090220.cms,"Representative AI image





NEW DELHI: China showcased a miniature, insect-like drone designed for covert surveillance missions, drawing global attention and concern over its potential military and espionage uses.Developed by the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), the drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It was unveiled on the Chinese military broadcaster CCTV-7 as part of an exhibit on next-generation robotic systems.In a demonstration aired over the weekend, NUDT student researcher Liang Hexiang held up the ultra-light robot and said, “Here in my hand is a mosquito-like type of robot. Miniature bionic robots like this one are especially suited to information reconnaissance and special missions on the battlefield.”The drone, resembling a real mosquito, is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. It can reportedly operate silently and without radar detection, carrying ultra-miniature cameras and microphones to capture images, sounds, and electronic signals. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.According to The Defense Post, the device’s compact build enables it to evade conventional detection systems and operate in confined spaces — a feature that has raised alarms among privacy advocates and military analysts.Experts warn that such drones could be exploited for espionage, cyber intrusions, or even biological warfare.“This could mean greater access to restricted areas such as secure government facilities,” noted Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. “If China is able to produce mosquito-sized drones, it would likely be interested in using them for various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tasks, especially in places that larger drones struggle to access, such as indoor areas. These drones could be used to track individuals or listen in on conversations.”Other experts are raising more dystopian concerns. Tracey Follows, a futurist and former Google advisor, told The Sun that such drones could be used for “untraceable murders” or carry pathogens, referencing a Black Mirror episode in which robotic insects were weaponised for targeted killings. “In time, one expects a drone to have the situational awareness to carry out an attack autonomously without a human in the loop,” she said. “The big question is what's the payload on these drones, what are you actually attaching to the drone?”The mosquito-sized UAV is part of a broader NUDT programme exploring micro-robotics, with parallel developments including artillery-launched drones that can survive the extreme conditions of being fired from 155mm cannon shells. These innovations reflect China’s ambition to lead in micro-UAV technology, a field seeing increasing global competition.Other countries have made strides in this area. Norway’s Black Hornet, developed by Teledyne FLIR Defence, is already used by militaries worldwide. The latest version, the Black Hornet 4, won the 2025 Blue UAS Refresh award from the US Department of Defence for advancements in battery life, signal range, and wind resistance. Meanwhile, Harvard University’s RoboBee project has demonstrated insect-sized drones that can transition from water to air and even perch on surfaces using static electricity.Beyond military applications, microdrones are being explored for civilian use in medicine, agriculture, and disaster response. In healthcare, they could enable precision drug delivery or internal imaging. In environmental monitoring, their small size allows access to hazardous zones during floods, fires, or chemical spills.Still, with their stealth capabilities and growing autonomy, these tiny machines are poised to become one of the most ethically and strategically complex technologies of the decade.","The drone is just 1.3 cm long and weighs less than 0.3 grams. It is equipped with two leaf-shaped wings, a slender black body, and three fine wire-like legs. Its small size makes it ideal for indoor surveillance, even inside secure government or military facilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122090369,imgsize-16976,width-400,resizemode-4/122090369.jpg"

'Manosphere': When influencers normalize misogyny for clicks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/manosphere-when-influencers-normalize-misogyny-for-clicks/articleshow/122159181.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

The rise of the Christian influencers:

Poisoned discourse on social media:





Misogyny is spreading on social media through the so-called ""manosphere."" These masculinity influencers, often young, well-educated men, present themselves as victims of feminism and call for their power to be ""reclaimed. ""Young users often come across this content by chance and get hooked. They end up existing in a parallel world full of anger, frustration and toxic ideology.The manosphere is a melting pot for anti-feminist narratives, which, thanks to social media, can spread like wildfire. The content ranges from manipulative dating advice to political demands aimed at weakening the social position of women to outright misogyny. What they all have in common is a fundamental rejection of equality between the sexes.Many videos appear professionally produced. ""They are men with microphones, usually in podcast situations, ranting about things like how women should not have a high 'body count' — in other words, that they shouldn't have slept with many men. This manosphere claims to be based on natural and traditional values, but it's actually about oppression,"" says Tara-Louise Wittwer, an author and video producer (@wastarasagt) who has been working on this topic for many years.""According to this traditional worldview, women are actively chosen by men. This is one of the alpha male's desired motives,"" says Wittwer. ""But the reality here is different: For the most part, a woman can choose someone herself, choose no one at all, choose another woman, or stay alone and perhaps be quite happy at 30 with three cats. That makes these kinds of men angry. They see they are losing power over women.""After a few hours scrolling through the world of masculinity influencers, one notices they share a similar perception of the world: Modern society is set against men, and men are therefore at a disadvantage. The desire for old social structures and gender stereotypes dominates these social media channels.Christian influences, or ""Christfluencers,"" as they are sometimes referred to, who invoke religion to restrict women's rights, propagate the same message.""It's an attempt to shift responsibility. Along the lines of, 'It's not our fault that we oppress women, because God or Jesus said so,' or 'Women are just worth less because of biology, are only allowed to be with a few men, are only allowed to do this and that,'"" says Wittwer.More and more women are also jumping on board. ""Make him a sandwich"" is a hashtag used by women who share the views of the manosphere and the ideology of ""natural order"" in relation to gender.""These women often highlight that it's their choice to live this dependent life — and that is not to be condemned at all. If a woman says, 'I want to be a traditional housewife, I'm fulfilled by being at home, cooking and having children,' then of course that's fine. Feminists fought for a long time to have this choice,"" says Wittwer. The problem is that when women are primarily active in the home, they disappear from public life and are unable to help shape [political] decisions and processes.Many of these women who share the ideas of the manosphere also create accounts and promote their lifestyle as the only valid one. ""Anyone who doesn't do this is labeled mentally ill and told they need therapy. As is so often the case, feminism is portrayed as an illness,"" says Wittwer.Wittwer is also active online and regularly produces German-language videos on the topic of equality and solidarity among women. She critically analyzes how patriarchal structures and influencers spread misogynistic content on social media — concise, pointed and with subtle humor.But not everyone likes it. Comments like ""but you have everything in Germany,"" in reference to women's rights in the country, are not uncommon. ""Statistics, however, show that every other day, women are killed by their partners or former partners,"" she points out.The criticism directed at her doesn't just come from men, but also from the feminist camp.""For some, I'm not radical enough. For example, I don't sympathize with the 4B movement (This radical feminist movement originates in South Korea and opposes marriage to men; women should not have children, romantic relationships, or sex with men: Eds.), partly because I have a husband myself, whom I wouldn't want to be without. It's not about marriage or not marriage. It's about women having choices and being able to decide. Women and men are not identical, but they are of equal value. And many people don't seem to want to understand that. It's about equal rights and equal value."" So, it is exactly the opposite of what the followers of the manosphere, whether men or women, want.The increasing popularity of this misogynistic movement poses great danger, with platforms like TikTok and YouTube serving as the perfect breeding grounds. Influencers sell toxic masculinity images as lifestyle tips and disguise hate as ""truth."" Young men are particularly vulnerable to this content. Social media is creating a new wave of misogynistic narratives that can be socially explosive.","Misogyny is spreading on social media through the so-called ""manosphere"" These masculinity influencers present themselves as victims of feminism and call for their power to be ""reclaimed"" Christian influences, or ""Christfluencers,"" who invoke religion to restrict women's rights propagate the same message.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122159263,imgsize-836965,width-400,resizemode-4/122159263.jpg"

Will Dubai’s 20-minute city vision melt under extreme summer heat? Is there a plan?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/will-dubais-20-minute-city-vision-melt-under-extreme-summer-heat-is-there-a-plan/articleshow/122119952.cms,"Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat (Representative Image)





How Expo City is Tackling the Heat



In winter: Encouraging walking through interactive, engaging spaces





In summer: Introducing climate-adapted solutions such as:



Climate-responsive urban design such as enclosed cool spaces



Shaded walking routes



Smart mobility hubs for bicycles and e-scooters



Electric vehicles to support inclusive and multi-modal mobility







Don’t Forget the Old Neighborhoods



Sustaining the Vision: Making 20-Minute Cities Work in the Real World

Reduced traffic congestion





Improved quality of life





Lower carbon emissions





Greater walkability and livability









Dubai is pushing forward with its ambitious goal of building “20-minute cities”: neighborhoods where residents can access 80% of their daily needs, such as work, school, shops, and parks, within a 20-minute walk, bike ride, or public transport trip. This urban planning concept is a cornerstone of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan and is already being realized through projects like the Model District in Al Barsha 2. Currently under construction. The goal is to reduce reliance on private vehicles by building compact, mixed-use communities that encourage local living. This means people will be able to live, work, study, and relax all within a 20-minute radius of their homes.A key metric in the plan is ensuring that 55 percent of Dubai’s residents live within 800 meters of a mass transit station, enabling them to reach 80 percent of their essential destinations with ease. The broader objective is to create smarter urban layouts that promote well-being, cut down on traffic congestion, and make everyday life more convenient for everyone, whether in newly developed areas or eventually in older neighborhoods as well.However, despite the well-thought-out design, one major challenge stands in the way: Dubai’s extreme summer heat.At Expo City Dubai, planners are leading the experimentation with adaptive solutions for year-round mobility, especially during the sweltering summer months.“In the winter, people are encouraged to walk,” explained Ivan Kyselov, Senior Manager of City Operations at Expo City Dubai, during his presentation at Mobility Live, a global event hosted at the venue that brings together experts in smart transport and mobility solutions.“It’s an experience and we promote it by activating the spaces around the walking routes. If you paint something on the pathway, kids will just simply play and walk these 15 minutes. Adults are the same. So we add an interactive element of architecture and urban development as a pit stop,” he added.To enhance accessibility and comfort, Expo City Dubai is adopting a flexible, seasonal approach:Kyselov noted these innovations are essential to maintaining multimodality, inclusivity, and accessibility throughout the year, especially in Dubai’s harsh climate.While new developments like Expo City are important, experts emphasized the importance of upgrading older districts to align with the 20-minute city model.Martin Tillman, a transport mobility planning expert, told Mobility Live attendees that regenerating aging urban areas should be a top priority.“We have to help regenerate the old city,” he said. “It's somewhat easier to go to a new field or site and to say this is how we're going to move forward. It's a little more difficult to go into something that's already existing and work on it because it doesn't have the parking provision or a rail network.”Tillman believes the effort is worth it:“The reward is significant,” he said. “Typically the previously planned cities were planned on the basis of better access for pedestrians and for people cycling. They tended to have better shape and were better coded for the day-to-day realities of living here in the Middle East. I think that's crucial and the idea of leaving that to decay is completely wrong.”With the Dubai 2040 Master Plan already underway, and projects like the Al Barsha 2 Model District and Expo City setting examples, the emirate is clearly committed to evolving its urban fabric.The idea of 20-minute cities offers:But success depends heavily on addressing climate realities, particularly by incorporating climate-controlled zones and adaptive infrastructure to keep residents comfortable and mobile year-round.If Dubai succeeds, it won’t just have redefined city living in the Gulf, it may also set a new benchmark for sustainable urban planning in hot climates globally.","Dubai is testing climate-controlled zones and shaded walkways to make its 20-minute city vision viable even during extreme summer heat.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

After Step 4, click on the 'Link Using ABHA Number' option and enter your ABHA number. Review the consent collection form carefully and provide your consent. Select the 'Get OTP' option, and an OTP will be sent to your mobile number registered with Aadhaar. Enter the OTP and click 'Verify OTP.' In the following step, you'll see the status of your CGHS beneficiary ID and ABHA ID. If the details match, you can click 'Print ABHA Card' to obtain a printout.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Nvidia’s Blackwell chips double AI training speed, MLCommons benchmark shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-blackwell-chips-double-ai-training-speed-mlcommons-benchmark-shows/articleshow/121630101.cms,"Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips have significantly advanced the training of large artificial intelligence systems, dramatically reducing the number of chips needed to train massive language models, new data released Wednesday shows.The results, published by MLCommons, a nonprofit that issues benchmark performance results for AI systems, detail improvements across chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), among others, Reuters reported.The benchmarks focus on AI training — the phase where systems learn from vast datasets — which remains a key competitive frontier despite the market’s growing focus on AI inference, or responding to user queries.One major finding was that Nvidia and its partners were the only ones to submit data for training a large-scale model like Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source AI system from Meta Platforms with trillions of parameters. This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

What is Apple's current partnership with OpenAI

What Apple's change in AI strategy mean

Apple Inc is considering a major shift in its artificial intelligence strategy, exploring partnerships with Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, potentially sidelining its in-house AI models, Bloomberg reported. This move aims to bolster Apple’s struggling AI efforts and keep pace with competitors in the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.According to the report, citing sources familiar with the matter, Apple has engaged in discussions with both Anthropic and OpenAI about integrating their large language models, such as Claude or ChatGPT, into Siri. The company has requested these firms train custom versions of their models to run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure, specifically its Private Cloud Compute servers powered by high-end Mac chips, to prioritize user privacy. These talks remain in early stages, and Apple has not finalized its decision, with an internal project, dubbed LLM Siri, still developing in-house models.The initiative, led by Siri chief Mike Rockwell and software engineering head Craig Federighi, follows a reassignment of Siri oversight from Apple’s AI chief, John Giannandrea, amid delays and underwhelming responses to Apple Intelligence features. The report noted that Rockwell, who assumed the Siri engineering role in March, instructed his team to evaluate whether third-party models like Claude, ChatGPT, or Google’s Gemini outperform Apple’s own technology. Testing reportedly showed Anthropic’s Claude as the most promising fit for Siri’s needs, prompting talks led by Apple’s vice president of corporate development, Adrian Perica.Siri, launched in 2011, has lagged behind modern AI chatbots, with promised upgrades like enhanced app control and personal data integration delayed from early 2025 to next spring, per Bloomberg. Apple’s broader AI strategy remains uncertain, with a multibillion-dollar budget approved for 2026 to run in-house models, but executives are increasingly open to third-party solutions for a quicker turnaround.Apple’s current AI features rely on its proprietary Apple Foundation Models, with plans for a 2026 Siri overhaul initially based on this technology. However, the report said that adopting third-party models could help Apple match the capabilities of AI assistants on Android devices, shedding its reputation as an AI laggard. This approach mirrors Samsung’s use of Google’s Gemini for its Galaxy AI features and Amazon’s integration of Anthropic’s technology for Alexa+.The shift has sparked concerns within Apple’s 100-person AI team, led by Ruoming Pang, with morale reportedly souring over the potential reliance on external technology. The report highlighted that some engineers feel their work is being undervalued, with competitors like Meta and OpenAI offering lucrative packages—ranging from $10 million to $40 million annually—to poach talent. Apple recently lost senior researcher Tom Gunter and narrowly retained its MLX team after counteroffers, underscoring the competitive pressure.While Apple already uses ChatGPT for certain Siri queries and text generation, discussions with Anthropic have hit snags over financial terms, with the startup seeking a multibillion-dollar annual fee. If no deal is reached, Apple may pivot to OpenAI or other providers, signaling a potential transformation in its AI approach.","Apple is exploring partnerships with Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, potentially sidelining its in-house AI models.

Nintendo stops selling Switch 2 gaming console on Amazon over price dispute: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nintendo-stops-selling-switch-2-gaming-console-on-amazon-over-price-dispute-report/articleshow/122165108.cms,"OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z3: Why This Neckband Still ROCKS in a TWS World!

Nintendo has stopped selling its products directly through e-commerce major Amazon in the US following a dispute over unauthorized sales by third-party sellers, reports Bloomberg. The conflict reportedly began when Nintendo noticed third-party merchants selling its games in the US at lower prices than the company’s official rates.According to a source cited by Bloomberg, these sellers were buying stock in Southeast Asia and exporting it to the US. Nintendo responded by pulling direct listings from Amazon’s US site last year. While some Nintendo products remained available, they were sold by independent merchants, not Amazon itself.Amazon attempted to resolve the issue by offering to label products as verified and authentic, a method it uses to fight counterfeiting. However, that was not enough to meet Nintendo’s expectations.A Nintendo spokesperson told Bloomberg, “There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers.” Amazon, in response, denied Bloomberg's claims and maintained that it offers Nintendo products directly to customers.Called as the biggest game console debut ever, Nintendo Switch 2 was released earlier this month. Nintendo has already sold more than 3.5 million units of the Switch 2 within just four days of launch, setting a new record for the company. The gaming giant now aims to sell 15 million units by March next year.At the launch, major US retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and GameStop had the console in stock. Amazon, however, only offered it in countries like Canada, Japan, and the UK — leaving many US customers frustrated and wondering when it would be available.Disputes between Amazon and major brands over third-party sales and product control aren’t new. Other companies such as Apple and Nike have also pulled or limited product listings in the past due to similar concerns. Some of those brands have since returned after negotiating stricter terms with Amazon.Recently, signs have emerged that Nintendo and Amazon may be rebuilding their relationship. Pre-orders for the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza are live on Amazon US and listed as “sold by Amazon.” But, as of Friday, Amazon still did not appear on Nintendo’s official list of US retailers selling the Switch 2.","Nintendo has stopped selling its products directly through e-commerce major Amazon in the US following a dispute over unauthorized sales.

Which Anker power banks are recalled

What users should do

How customers should dispose affected Anker powerbanks

Anker is recalling another five power banks, making a second recall this month. According to The Verge, the company has warned customers worldwide to stop using five additional power bank models due to the risk of overheating, smoke, melting, or fire. The issue is linked to lithium-ion batteries provided by one of its suppliers, which may pose safety hazards. Anker, as per the report, says the risk of malfunction is low, but it is recalling the products as a safety measure. This follows a similar recall earlier this month involving the Anker PowerCore 10000 (model A1263) sold in the United States.The five newly recalled models include: Anker Power Bank (models A1257 and A1647), Anker MagGo Power Bank (model A1652), and Anker Zolo Power Bank (models A1681 and A1689).Users can identify if they own one of the affected products by checking the model number on the back or side of the device.Customers in the US can receive a free replacement or an Anker gift card by filling out a recall claim form on the company’s website. They will need to provide a product serial number or proof of purchase to be eligible.While no specific purchase date range has been mentioned for these five models, Anker advises users to stop using them immediately and dispose of them properly.Anker emphasizes that recalled power banks should not be thrown in the trash or regular recycling bins due to fire risks. Instead, users must take them to a certified facility that handles lithium-ion batteries. Disposing of them incorrectly could cause fires or environmental harm.","Anker is recalling another five power banks, making a second recall this month.
