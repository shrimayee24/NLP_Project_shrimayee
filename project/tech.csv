Claims of discrimination

Online reactions

NEW DELHI: A video featuring a woman claiming that ""Bengaluru is Bengaluru because of North Indians"" has gone viral on social media, igniting discussions about regional contributions and perceptions in India's Silicon Valley.The clip, shared on X (formerly Twitter ) by a user identified as Woke Eminent, has garnered over 692,500 views and nearly 4,500 likes.In the video, the woman, originally from North India, responded to a question about the cultural shocks she experienced after moving to Bengaluru. She alleged that North Indians often face discrimination in the city and are addressed as ""these Hindi people.""""I don't know about cultural shock here. But people here do hate North Indians. That's what I have observed,"" she said. ""Autowalas charge us higher prices, and people call us 'these Hindi people.' We've been addressed as Hindi people many times.""Despite these experiences, the woman expressed her admiration for Bengaluru, saying, ""I love this city, absolutely, and would want to visit again. But the fact that when they see outsiders, they behave differently with you, especially when Bengaluru is what it is because of North Indians coming here to a large extent and still, people have a hard time accepting it.""The video sparked mixed reactions online. Some users supported the woman's perspective, emphasising the significant contribution of North Indians to Bengaluru’s IT industry. Others argued that the city's success stems from the opportunities it provides, regardless of regional origins.One user commented, “Most of the engineers in the firms located in Bengaluru are from northern states.” Meanwhile, others countered by saying, “Bengaluru provided the platform and infrastructure for these opportunities. Respect the city’s identity.”","A video featuring a woman claiming that ""Bengaluru is Bengaluru because of North Indians"" has gone viral on social media.

Legitimate companies will use their official domains.* Don't be pressured into acting fast: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into making mistakes.* Research before donating: Before you donate to a charity, research them online to ensure their legitimacy.* Report suspicious emails: Report any suspicious emails to Google to help improve its spam filters.","Google is reminding Gmail users to be vigilant against festive scams.

Streaming and NFL's Wider Strategy

For the first time in history, Netflix is airing live NFL games on Christmas. This will give you an opportunity to enjoy the beautiful game in a totally different way. The historical games include two high-stakes matches: the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. the Houston Texans.Here's everything you need to know about the schedule, streaming options, and what makes these games so special.Netflix has signed a three-year deal with the NFL, which will stream two Christmas Day games in exchange for $150 million annually. This debut lineup is a dream come true for football enthusiasts, who will see four playoff-bound teams battling for their final seeding.The Steelers (10-5) host the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs (14-1) at 1 p.m. ET, and the Ravens (10-5) take on the Texans, already assured of the AFC South, at 4:30 p.m. ET. Both the Steelers and Ravens are still in competition for the AFC North crown, making these highly awaited games even more dramatic.All Netflix subscribers, whether using the ad-supported plan at $6.99/month or the premium tier at $22.99/month, are able to enjoy the games live. There are a total of 283 million subscribers worldwide.If you are not a Netflix subscriber but live in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Houston, or Baltimore, you are able to watch the games on CBS-TV affiliates where you live.The Christmas Day games promise more than thrilling football. Netflix has arranged a fun pre-game show from 11 a.m. ET, which features Mariah Carey's classic ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Beyoncé will perform live at halftime of the Ravens-Texans game, singing songs from her album Cowboy Carter.Netflix is coming from the back of the huge success of Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match in November. The event peaked at an incredible 65 million concurrent streams, making it one of the biggest moments in Netflix sports streaming history. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. The stream encountered technical problems, with some viewers facing buffering issues. Will Netflix continue the momentum from the great boxing match and bring a seamless experience for NFL fans? Or will it have another streaming problem? The pressure is on.This is not the NFL's first foray into streaming. Amazon Prime Video, Peacock, and ESPN+ have all previously streamed games, with Amazon leading the charge by hosting Thursday Night Football. But the league's decision to add Netflix to the fold is a further example of the league's commitment to increasing its reach through digital channels.Well, break out the snacks and get cozy—this Christmas, Netflix isn't just for movies and series anymore.Also read - All you need to know about Beyoncé’s NFL Christmas performance tomorrow which will be available for just 3 hours post-match in the US.","Netflix has signed a three-year deal with the NFL, which will stream two Christmas Day games in exchange for $150 million annually.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

The 24-hour study by Heat Initiative and ParentsTogether Action reviewed 800 apps and found that problematic apps garnered more than 550 million combined downloads.The investigation uncovered widespread issues across apps rated 4+, 9+, or 12+ in categories like chat, beauty, diet, internet access, and gaming. Among the concerning discoveries were 25 chat apps enabling stranger communication with minors, apps promoting extreme dieting behaviors, and gaming apps soliciting inappropriate photos. Many apps also offered ways to bypass school and home internet filters, even while carrying ratings suitable for young children. Apple takes no legal responsibility for the veracity of age ratings,"" the report stated, despite the company's claims that the App Store is a ""trusted place"" for users. The study found nearly all weight loss and unfiltered internet access apps were approved for children aged four and above. The researchers called for several reforms, including implementation of independent third-party reviews, greater transparency in the app rating process, stronger enforcement of age ratings, and enhanced parental controls.While Apple conducts both automated and manual checks on apps and provides features like Screen Time for child protection, the company acknowledges that "" App Store security measures alone can never be perfect."" With nearly 2 million apps on the platform, comprehensive screening remains challenging. The report's authors emphasized that the most effective protection requires both improved app screening and engaged parenting, recommending that parents actively monitor their children's app usage and verify app safety through personal testing.The findings come amid broader scrutiny of the App Store, including a recent $1.95 billion EU fine over anti-competitive practices in March 2024.

Today's Strands’ answers:

The first word is holly.

The second word is willow.

The third word is brook.

The fourth word is laurel.

The fifth word is river.

The sixth word is clementine.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Google Santa tracker: How to use and top features



Google Santa Tracker , is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide. This feature offers a digital way to follow Santa’s journey on Christmas Eve . Each December 24, Google transforms Santa's Village into an interactive tracking experience, delighting children and adults alike. The platform provides updates on Santa's route, showing his progress as he and his reindeer travel across the globe spreading Christmas cheer. Here’s how the tradition started:This festive tradition that began in 2004 builds on NORAD's long-standing Santa tracking program but has evolved with Google’s modern technology, incorporating playful features and educational games to engage users throughout the holiday season.Meanwhile, NORAD’s tradition of tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve began in 1955 when a misprint in a department store advertisement prompted a child to call a Colorado military command centre, hoping to speak with Santa Claus.Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup, who answered the call, pretended to be Santa and reassured the child. As more calls came in, Shoup assigned an officer to manage the enquiries, which started the festive custom that NORAD carried on after its establishment in 1958.For decades, NORAD has paused its regular airspace monitoring duties each holiday season to answer children’s questions about Santa’s journey and his remarkable gift-delivery mission. Each year, over 100,000 kids call in to track Santa’s location, while millions more follow his progress online in nine languages as he travels across the globe spreading holiday cheer.Santa's journey can be tracked using Google’s tool on iPhone, iPad or Mac by accessing the official Santa Tracking website through a web browser. The site includes a live map displaying Santa's current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his travels, and estimated arrival times for specific locations.The website also showcases photos of places Santa has already visited, a live tally of gifts delivered, and his current distance from the user's location. Additionally, it offers a variety of interactive activities, including games, creative projects, and videos, making the experience engaging and entertaining.","Google Santa Tracker is a popular Christmas feature that allows users to track Santa Claus in real time as he delivers presents worldwide.

AI systems will have emotions because…

Yann LeCun , Meta ’s Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions. In a recent interview, LeCun explained that emotions are an “inseparable component” of the design of advanced AI systems.“So the blueprint of AI systems that we’re envisioning, that we’re going to build over the next few years — those AI systems will have emotions. It’s a basically inseparable component of the design of those systems,” he said while responding to a question at an interview.He argues that emotions are a natural consequence of AI agents being driven by objectives and goals.“Why would they have emotions? Because they will be driven by objectives,” LeCun explained. “You give them a goal that they have to accomplish, a task, and their purpose is to accomplish this task, subject to guardrails that are hardwired into their design,” he added.“And for them to do this, they need a number of components. The first component they need is a way to determine whether this goal that we give them was accomplished or not. And what they also need is what we call a world model. What is a world model is something that we all have — a prefrontal cortex that allows us to imagine what the consequences of our actions. And it’s what allows us to plan a sequence of actions to accomplish a particular goal. Now if you have this ability to predict ahead of time what a sequence of action is going to produce, then you can predict whether a goal is going to be satisfied or not. And you can predict if the outcome is going to be good or bad,” LeCun added.LeCun believes that this ability to predict and react to potential outcomes will give rise to emotions in AI.“If you predict it’s going to be bad, you feel fear. If you predict it’s going to be good, it’s more like elation, right? So, (you’ll need) the ability to predict, and then to act so as to accomplish those predictions (which) produces the equivalent of emotions. So AI systems that are smart enough, that are capable of reasoning and planning, will have emotions,” he explained.","Yann LeCun, Meta’s Chief AI Scientist, has made a bold, or rather provocative, prediction: future AI systems will possess emotions.

The store has eliminated its practice of including hint-laden wrapping paper art, while also offering DLC instead of full games in some cases.The latest controversy peaked on December 23 when the platform offered Dark and Darker – Legendary Status DLC as its fifth mystery gift, requiring users to already own the base game. This marked a departure from previous years' offerings of complete games, leading to widespread disappointment among the community.A key point of contention is the removal of the promotional wrapping paper artwork that traditionally contained clues about upcoming games. While some users praise this change for maintaining genuine surprise, others lament the loss of the community guessing game that had become a holiday tradition.The promotion, running from December 19 to January 2, continues to offer daily free items instead of the store's usual weekly schedule. However, users have noted that this year's selections have been less notable compared to previous holiday giveaways.Adding to the changes, the usual pattern of advance leaks has been disrupted, with fewer accurate predictions circulating online. When leaks do occur, they now typically emerge just hours before releases, rather than days or weeks in advance as in previous years.The platform's holiday promotion will continue through early January, though the community remains divided over whether these changes represent an improvement or deterioration of the annual event."," Epic Games Store's 2024 holiday mystery game promotion has sparked controversy among users.

Meta Ray-Ban glasses with display: What to expect

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses. Rumours claim that these smart glasses may soon feature a display. A new report suggests that the next-generation model could launch by 2025. The current model supports voice commands and audio feedback. A display will not only improve the user experience by allowing more intuitive interactions and visual information but will also help the Meta Ray-Ban glasses with Apple’s mixed reality headset, Vision Pro.Using the glasses' reading feature is often convenient, but there are situations where a visual display proves more efficient. People can typically read text faster than it can be narrated, making the option important.According to a report by the Financial Times, this functionality is expected to arrive soon. The report claims that this upgrade marks a major step in Meta’s efforts to develop lightweight headsets that replace smartphones as consumers’ primary computing devices.The report cites sources familiar with the plans to claim that the social media giant is planning to integrate a screen into the $300 (above Rs 25,000) sunglasses it produces in collaboration with eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica.The upgraded Ray-Ban glasses could launch as soon as the second half of 2025, featuring a small display designed to showcase notifications or responses from Meta’s virtual assistant.Similar to the Vision Pro, the Meta’s smart glasses are also unavailable in India.Previously, Meta unveiled an early prototype of its Orion AR glasses. Although the design is admittedly bulky and comes with a reported manufacturing cost of $10,000. However, the prototype offered a glimpse into the potential of augmented reality in a form factor closer to the existing Ray Ban smart glasses.Apple is also believed to share a similar vision, with its long-term goal reportedly focused on developing AR glasses. The Vision Pro is seen as an initial step on the path toward the anticipated Apple Glasses. While voice interaction will likely be a key feature, Apple is expected to prioritise integrated displays in its designs.",Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly planning an upgrade for its Ray-Ban glasses.

Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination, especially after recent high-profile cases involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek . Both players faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.Sinner and Swiatek, who both reached the top ranking in professional tennis, incurred substantial expenses to demonstrate the unintentional nature of the banned substances found in their systems. This financial burden raises concerns for players with fewer resources.“A lot of the players I know are quite apprehensive,” former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu said.Raducanu expressed her concerns about the risk of contamination in supplements and the financial burden of batch testing. Many players are cautious about the supplements they take due to the risk of contamination.“Everything we take, we're aware of the situation and how easily things can be contaminated. There are certain supplements that I may want to take, but I can't take them because they're sold over the counter and not batch tested.”The cost of batch testing, exceeding $1,000, creates a financial barrier for many athletes.Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev , a former world number five, shared similar anxieties about consuming anything he's not entirely certain about. He admitted to being 'super afraid.'Andrea Petroczi, a researcher on anti-doping at Kingston University in London, confirmed the growing apprehension among elite athletes worldwide regarding unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Her research reveals increasing concerns among athletes about the potential consequences of such violations.“(They) expressed fear and anxiety about unintentionally violating anti-doping rules that could have grave consequences on their reputation, careers and livelihoods,” Petroczi explained.Athletes are adopting various precautionary measures to minimize the risk of contamination. These measures include thoroughly checking medications, avoiding unnecessary treatments, and opting for third-party tested supplements.Athletes also meticulously record batch numbers of supplements and medicines. Some even go to the extent of maintaining detailed logs and avoiding specific foods in certain countries. However, they recognize that even these precautions cannot entirely eliminate the risk.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The accessibility of resources and strategies for such vigilance varies across different regions. This disparity in access creates additional challenges for athletes in certain areas.“There is a clear 'Global North'/'Global South' divide, with disparities in education, resources and support systems, leaving many athletes more vulnerable.”Jannik Sinner's case involved trace amounts of clostebol, an anabolic androgenic steroid. He successfully demonstrated to doping authorities that the substance entered his system through massages administered by his physiotherapist.Despite being cleared, Sinner faces a potential ban of up to two years due to an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ongoing appeal creates uncertainty regarding Sinner's future participation in professional tennis.Iga Swiatek, who tested positive for trimetazidine, a hormone and metabolic modulator, served a one-month ban. She attributed the positive test to contamination of her sleep medication.Swiatek revealed the significant financial costs she incurred in defending her case, including legal fees and expert opinions. She spent $70,000 on a lawyer and over $15,000 on expert opinions.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The handling of Sinner and Swiatek's cases contrasts with the experiences of other players, such as Simona Halep and Tara Moore , who have criticized the anti-doping system for lengthy delays in their cases. The contrasting experiences highlight inconsistencies in the handling of doping cases.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) assumed responsibility for tennis's anti-doping program in 2022. The ITIA was formed by the seven governing bodies of tennis after a comprehensive review of the previous system, which was overseen by the International Tennis Federation.Sinner and Swiatek's cases are the most high-profile investigations undertaken by the ITIA since it took over. Both players held the world number one ranking when they failed their tests, further highlighting the significance of these cases.The ITIA asserts that all doping cases are handled impartially, based on evidence and facts, irrespective of a player's ranking, name, or nationality. However, concerns about potential discrepancies in the system persist.Petroczi highlighted the impact of limited access to legal representation and advanced analytical testing on an athlete's ability to effectively contest a doping case . These limitations create further disparities within the system.Being unable to access legal representation and advanced analytical testing would impact an athlete's ability to fight a doping case, Petroczi added, and sports federations and anti-doping organisations had to address this disparity in resources.Addressing the disparity in resources available to athletes requires collective efforts from sports federations and anti-doping organizations. These efforts should focus on ensuring equitable access to expert support and transparency in processes.“Efforts could include providing equitable access to expert support, ensuring transparency in processes, and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of resource gaps,” Petroczi suggested.Unlike athletes in many other sports, tennis players are essentially self-employed. Therefore, any time away from the game due to a doping ban or related legal battles directly impacts their income.Andrey Rublev advocated for quicker rulings in cases of accidental contamination and a degree of flexibility in the anti-doping rules. He believes the current system is overly strict and creates undue fear among players.“Of course, you want to have a clean sport,” Rublev stated.He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean sport while also expressing concerns about the strictness of the current rules. He believes the system needs to be more flexible to avoid penalizing players for unintentional violations.“But you also want (it to be) not so strict because then you make all the tennis players so afraid that even those situations (that are not you fault) cost you a year.”The current system can lead to significant penalties, including lengthy bans, even in cases of accidental contamination. This creates a climate of fear among players.“It shouldn't be like that.”",Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116601999,imgsize-42002,width-400,resizemode-4/116601999.jpg"

Vince Russo's Criticism of Bianca Belair's Ring Work

What Awaits Bianca Belair

Bianca Belair & Naomi vs. Nia Jax & Candice LeRae in title bout: SmackDown highlights, Dec. 20, 2024

Bianca Belair , one of the top superstars of WWE, has been forwarding a light-hearted message. Most probably, it is for Angelo Dawkins 's husband Montez Ford 's partner in tag-team. Conjoined by the Street Profits , Dawkins and Ford have successfully made their place as some of the best tag teams in WWE having now won quite a few titles since inception into the company in 2016.She is an in-ring performer and is appreciated in the WWE as a whole along with her parent idol, but off the ring, she has most of the time brought cheers to her people through humor. To the latest from her funny social media engagement, Belair has shared a post with an edited picture featuring Angelo Dawkins as their 'child' with her and Montez Ford.“Real life @AngeloDawkins And y’all better not say my baby ugly,” Belair wrote.While Belair relishes in adoration from her fans, not all are sold on her skills in telling a story in the ring. Vince Russo made his observations on Sportskeeda Wrestling's ""The Wrestling Outlaws"", stating that Belair has failed to sell injuries during all her performances in a pretty convincing manner.Russo said: “When I’m seeing Bianca Belair having her entire side taped up and then the next moment she’s pressing Piper Niven, no, that’s not a great worker, Chris, because I didn’t believe it for a second, “Russo said. “Your ribs are totally fine. First of all, you should never try to put that weight up. Second of all, if you’re putting that weight up, you would collapse to your knees. So, no, not a great worker, Chris.”Regardless of the criticism, Belair is still a strong force in WWE. She will ostensibly accompany Naomi as they defend the Women's Tag Team Championships until Jade Cargill makes her much-anticipated return. Belair's special strength of agility and presence maintains her forefront in the women's division.Bianca Belair's flippancy with Angelo Dawkins offers a tantalizing peek at what she's like outside the ring for the very people who spurned her in favor of more mainstream heroes. Criticism aside, though Russo may continue to raise controversy over her in-ring actions, wading through all of Belair's ever-growing accolades and fan support makes it clear that she stands head-and-shoulders above most of the rawest WWE stars today.Also Read : WrestleMania 41: A Possibly Return of a WWE Superstar Against John Cena","Bianca Belair has been forwarding a light-hearted message on social media.

WWE Superstars marrying or getting engaged to each other is nothing new and another such instance has taken place and the fans can’t contain their joy. RAW Superstar Maxxine Dupri has been officially engaged with NXT talent Anthony Luke. She shared the happy news on different social media platforms, including Instagram . In a flurry of beautiful photos, Dupri also shared a picture of her engagement ring. The talented star wrote “forever” in the caption.Dupri is fast becoming one of the more popular superstars of the “Red Brand” roster, as she has been a big part of the Alpha Academy, alongside Akira Tozawa and Otis. She has improved leaps and bounds both inside the ring and on the mic and has had some highly entertaining segments with her teammate, Otis and former mentor Chad Gable. She was also involved in a “coming out of the shadow” storyline with Chad and Otis, where Chad finally left the Alpha Academy alone, and the members of the faction are on their own and ready to flourish on RAW. While Dupri is on ascendance on RAW, her fiance Anthony Luke has been on different live events of NXT and is yet to debut on television. It won’t be long before he makes a name for himself in the developmental brand of WWE. Expectedly, there has been no official word from WWE about it yet.In the Instagram post shared by Maxxine, the soon to be married couple looked extremely happy and joyful and were soon bestowed upon with congratulatory messages and thousands of well wishes from the fans. While Dupri obviously enjoys more followers on different social media platforms, Anthony, who may not have yet made a big name for himself in the ring, has already achieved major success in real life, as he is engaged to a beautiful and talented star like Maxxine.

Travis Hunter Heisman Trophy: Travis Hunter’s Heisman Win Overshadowed by Relationship Drama: Fans Draw Parallels to Simone Biles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunters-heisman-win-overshadowed-by-relationship-drama-fans-draw-parallels-to-simone-biles/articleshow/116641398.cms,"Imago

The ""Catch"" That Sparked a Frenzy



Travis Hunter's Heisman Trophy Celebration Turned Sour



Standing Up Against the Hate



Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens: A Familiar Tune



The Hypocrisy of Public Scrutiny



Ah, the internet, where no one's relationship is safe from scrutiny and everyone's an expert on someone else's love life. The latest drama features Simone Biles, husband Jonathan Owens, Travis Hunter, and a whole load of online chaos. Prepare the popcorn because this rollercoaster is coming next.Let's go back to December 2023, when Jonathan Owens casually said on the The Pivot podcast that he did not know who Simone Biles was when they met and that ""men are always the catch in a relationship."" Cue the uproar. Fans called him ""mean,"" some demanded Biles ""divorce this man,"" and the internet lit up with debates.Context is key here. Owens was then a practice squad player while Biles was already the global icon with five Olympic medals. But Biles wasn't rattled. She stood by her man and clapped back at the noise. Fast forward a year, and now this moment is being compared to the drama surrounding Travis Hunter and his fiancée, Leanna Lenee.Hunter should have been basking in the glory of his 2024 Heisman Trophy win. Instead, the spotlight has shifted to his fiancée, Leanna Lenee, who remained seated during the standing ovation at the ceremony. Deion Sanders had to nudge her to stand, sparking speculation that something was off. Cue the trolls, who accused her of being ""stuck up"" and ""disrespectful.It didn't end there. Clips of a post-Heisman event in New York surfaced, showing Lenee looking frustrated while Hunter took pictures with fans.Hunter was not taking it. On Twitch, he defended Lenee, sharing how the negativity affected them. He revealed that she cried herself to sleep after the ceremony and turned to alcohol to cope. ""Y'all hate on me, then you hate on my girl,"" he said, emphasizing their five-year bond.Lenee also cleared the air on TikTok, saying she was frustrated over post-event logistics, not fans. "" ""I wasn’t annoyed with any fans at all. I’m never annoyed with fans,"" she clarified, shutting down the speculation.Even Dez Bryant jumped into the fray, tweeting, “I’m here to tell you, brother… wake up and quit playing… she loves the attention way more than you.” Ouch.Fans couldn't help but draw parallels. One said,“Seeing women try to grandstand about Travis when they literally tried to ruin Simone Biles marriage over one comment they didn’t like is the height of hypocrisy.” Another pointed out the double standard, noting how women were clowned for defending Biles when Owens made his infamous ""catch"" comment, yet the same critics are now ""warning"" Hunter.Biles, for her part, admitted the backlash hurt her feelings. ""I don't understand why people were so hateful,"" she shared, adding that Owens is ""the sweetest guy."" Owens, meanwhile, shrugged off the noise with a pragmatic approach: ""People are going to talk about you anyway, so you might as well do it the way you want to.""Whether it is Biles and Owens or Hunter and Lenee, this pattern was the same : judgment and criticism plus more double standard. It summarized best that one of his fans explained: ""This app doing the same thing to Travis Hunter they did to Simone Biles.”For Hunter, the drama mounts with claims of a pre-marital affair with Lenee. Instead of basking in the triumph of his Heisman Trophy, he is facing stern scrutiny. It is very telling of the emotional warfare public figures face when they are turned into internet circuses.Also read - NFL Christmas Day Streaming on Netflix: Times, Teams, and Exclusive Halftime Show Details","Simone Biles, husband Jonathan Owens, Travis Hunter, and a whole load of online chaos.
