Natalie Reynolds’ Emotional Meltdown Outside TikTok HQ

Why Was Natalie Reynolds Crying Outside TikTok Headquarters in Viral Video?

Why Caused the TikTok Ban?

The Lake Incident That Sparked Backlash

What’s Next for Natalie?





A video of content creator Natalie Reynolds breaking down outside the TikTok headquarters has gone viral, and the internet has a lot to say. But who exactly is Natalie Reynolds? Why was she crying? And what led up to this dramatic moment? Here’s everything you need to know about the 26-year-old streamer making headlines again.Natalie Reynolds is a 26-year-old social media influencer based in Los Angeles. She first gained traction on TikTok in 2022 with lip-sync and dance videos. Over time, her content evolved into prank skits, relationship-based comedy, and risqué banter with her boyfriend, Zack (real name: Zachary Huelsman). The duo’s playful videos made them regulars on the “For You” page.Beyond TikTok, Natalie has built a strong online presence. She has:On June 9, a video surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) showing Natalie outside TikTok's headquarters in tears. She was seen anxiously speaking on the phone, pleading to be let inside. The reason? Her TikTok account had been banned, and she was reportedly trying to get it reinstated. Her emotional breakdown struck a chord online, with users debating whether it was genuine distress or a publicity move.As of now, the exact reason behind Natalie’s TikTok ban remains unclear. Neither TikTok nor Natalie has officially commented on the matter.However, speculation online suggests the ban may be linked to a controversial prank that backfired in a big way.In May, Natalie faced intense criticism after a prank video showed her convincing a homeless woman to jump into Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas, for just $20. The woman allegedly didn’t know how to swim.Natalie reportedly reassured her it was part of a “scavenger hunt” and promised to jump in after her. But when the woman entered the water, Natalie backed out and walked away.The woman was heard shouting that she couldn’t swim, only float. A firetruck was later seen arriving at the scene, presumably to help. Natalie and her group had already left by then.Many viewers were outraged, calling for legal action. Despite the uproar, Natalie shrugged off the backlash and showed no sign of remorse in her follow-up content.Despite the TikTok ban and public backlash, Natalie continues to post content on her other platforms. She remains active on Kick, where she hosts livestreams and talks about her life. She’s also still posting on Instagram and YouTube.However, her recent controversies are raising questions about influencer accountability—and whether platforms should step in when lines are crossed.Natalie Reynolds went viral for all the wrong reasons this time. From prank-gone-wrong to a breakdown at TikTok HQ, her journey is a reminder of how fast things can turn on the internet. Whether she makes a comeback or fades into digital infamy, one thing’s certain: the internet is watching.","Natalie Reynolds is a 26-year-old social media influencer based in Los Angeles.

Ex-Google MD recalls giving Sundar Pichai unsolicited advice on Chromebooks: ‘He knew way more than I did’; calls him a great listener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-google-md-recalls-giving-sundar-pichai-unsolicited-advice-on-chromebooks-he-knew-way-more-than-i-did/articleshow/121758410.cms,"



Parminder Singh, a former Managing Director at Google (Google Display, APAC) and Twitter, shared a light-hearted yet insightful anecdote on X about a chance encounter with Sundar Pichai years before he rose to become Google’s CEO.Singh recalled attending a Google office party in Mountain View where he was introduced to “an unassuming person who led the Chrome project.” Mistaking the humility for lack of knowledge, Singh said he began offering advice on Chrome notebooks, assuming shared tech expertise.“He listened patiently to my modest suggestions, even asking follow-up questions,” Singh wrote. “It soon became clear that he knew far more than I did — he was simply being gracious.”A few years later, Singh was surprised to learn that the man he had casually advised was none other than Sundar Pichai, newly announced as Google’s CEO. “That’s the thing about good leaders — they are great listeners,” Singh added.Reflecting on the moment years later, Singh said he recently listened to Pichai's two-hour interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, joking, “Balance restored, I guess!”When a user asked what advice he had given, Singh said he couldn’t recall much but believed he suggested making Chrome notebooks “more fun/playful” for school children and improving language translation tools for native speakers.Clarifying some confusion caused by the post, Singh added humorously, “It was a Google ‘office’ party — Google party is not a new app (since someone asked!).”","Parminder Singh, a former Managing Director at Google (Google Display, APAC) and Twitter, shared a light-hearted yet insightful anecdote on X.

As McLaren’s Lando Norris took his maiden victory on the iconic Monte Carlo circuit, the event became much more than just a race. Celebrities and elite guests including Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, Dua Lipa, Sofia Vergara, and Odell Beckham Jr. turned Monaco into the ultimate playground of glitz and glamour. From lavish yacht parties to exclusive art events, Monaco gave fans an extraordinary peek into the high life beyond the track.One of the weekend’s most talked-about activities was the debut of the RD Grand Prix, a three-day superyacht experience at Port Hercule. Hosting around a hundred VIPs, the 180-foot yacht combined live music, fine dining, and trackside viewing of the race. Robin Thicke opened with a private concert, followed by a surprise Sunday night set from DJ Rampa, who premiered new speakers to an electrified crowd including Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.Created by Ben Biscotti and Sylvain Bitton, RD Grand Prix was designed to mix tech billionaires, royalty, and fashion icons with racing fans in a setting of unrivaled luxury. Guests enjoyed champagne on the rooftop bar, relaxed in an outdoor hot tub, shopped fashion pop-ups, and dined on cuisine by Michelin-starred chef Marc Forgione. Sponsors like RUMOR Rosé and Lewis Hamilton’s Almave spirit added to the upscale vibe. Biscotti says the goal is to “redefine luxury and experiential hospitality” by crafting unforgettable moments that blend entertainment and exclusivity.Just a short walk from the RD Grand Prix, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. hosted his FRI&NDS activation aboard his private yacht.

This initiative empowers underserved Portuguese communities through art and education.

GTA 6: Key gameplay leaks



GTA 6: Upgraded map



GTA 6: More speculated features



While Rockstar Games maintains a tight lid on information surrounding the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, a new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online, offering more details about the game's gameplay mechanics, expansive map, and various content elements. The leaks suggest that GTA 6 will feature over 700 enterable stores, functional malls, and a revamped character-switching system. Rockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 will launch on May 26, 2026, for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though a PC release date remains unannounced.According to reports from various gaming news outlets and social media discussions, these recent leaks suggest several intriguing gameplay additions. Among them is the purported return of a 6-star wanted level, a fan-favourite feature from previous GTA instalments. The ""relationship bar,"" previously hinted at in leaked 2022 clips and said to function akin to the ""honour"" system in Red Dead Redemption 2, also reportedly still exists.New elements include weight mechanics and explorable underwater areas brimming with treasure and secrets. The leak also claims that the scene from Trailer 2 where Jason buys beer is actual gameplay, hinting at enhanced environmental interaction. The ""greet and antagonise"" system, seen in Red Dead Redemption 2, is also rumoured to be integrated.A significant detail suggests a revamped character wheel with three options: playing as Solo Jason, Solo Lucia, or a Dual protagonist control mode allowing simultaneous control of both characters for open-world robberies and specific missions.The leaks indicate that GTA 6’s map will not feature a Panhandle, contradicting previous speculation. However, the game will still include a vast open world, with Vice City at its core and additional locations inspired by Florida’s diverse landscapes.While a ""Disney World parody"" is reportedly not included, fans are dissecting every pixel of the existing trailers and unconfirmed data to piece together the full scope of Vice City and its surrounding areas, including Ambrosia and Port Gellhorn.Further alleged content details include the presence of male strippers, an assertion that the driving mechanics are the ""best it's ever been,"" and gore/dismemberment built upon Red Dead Redemption 2's system. However, some rumoured features from earlier leaks, such as fully nude sex scenes, listening to music outside of a car, prone movement, and dual-wielding weapons, are now claimed to have been cut. The story is reportedly structured into five chapters, similar to Red Dead Redemption 2.","A new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online.

“Gay Vin Diesel”: Antonio Brown drags Cory Booker with homophobic slur—NFL fans call for accountability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gay-vin-diesel-antonio-brown-drags-cory-booker-with-homophobic-slurnfl-fans-call-for-accountability/articleshow/121743877.cms,"Antonio Brown sparked backlash after mocking Senator Cory Booker over a viral AI-generated image (Image via AP)

Antonio Brown slammed for offensive comment on Cory Booker’s AI photo





Antonio Brown is no stranger to controversy, but his latest outburst has sparked a fresh wave of backlash. After mocking Senator Cory Booker over a viral AI image, the former Steelers star finds himself at the center of a political and social firestorm. His crude remark—likening Booker to a “gay Vin Diesel”—has ignited outrage across social media. As Brown flirts with an NFL comeback, many wonder if his behavior continues to overshadow his talent.Former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown recently made headlines by taking a jab at U.S. Senator Cory Booker. This incident unfolded on Monday when Brown reacted to a widely circulated AI-generated image of the politician.The situation began with a Twitter user's post featuring an AI-generated image that depicted Booker in pink attire, standing in front of the White House. Brown, known for his outspoken nature, responded to this viral image by commenting on Booker's appearance. He explicitly wrote, ""This n***a look like the gay Vin Diesel,"" a remark that quickly garnered attention and sparked discussion across social media.Antonio Brown's controversial NFL career, largely with Pittsburgh, concluded after seven seasons.Conversely, Senator Cory Booker, New Jersey's senior senator, played college football at Stanford from 1987-1991. Brown's recent post followed renewed speculation about his potential NFL return, fueled by a report that Aaron Rodgers contacted him about a comeback.Despite Antonio Brown's league absence since his 2021 departure from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, these comeback whispers quickly gained traction. Yet, it's important to note that neither the Pittsburgh Steelers nor Aaron Rodgers have publicly confirmed these speculations, leaving them unverified.Adding to the Steelers' recent roster changes, they also traded wide receiver George Pickens, reportedly due to off-field personality issues. Brown himself carries a documented history of legal troubles and inflammatory social media activity.Beyond his recent football-related headlines, Antonio Brown also gained attention in 2024 for his advocacy for Donald Trump during the presidential election season. He notably appeared at a campaign rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where he publicly supported the former president. During the rally, Brown stated, “No matter what the media threw at him… he continues to push forward and keep getting back up,” in reference to Trump.Senator Cory Booker, on the other hand, pursued a distinctly different path after his football career. An All-American defensive back at Stanford from 1987 through 1991, Booker continued his academic pursuits, earning a Rhodes Scholarship and attending Yale Law School.Also Read: Cam Newton slams Antonio Brown for trying to sabotage Shilo Sanders’ NFL future over viral training video controversy He was also a member of the 1986 USA Today All-USA high school team, a roster that included future NFL stars such as Emmitt Smith and Ricky Watters.

As everyone’s geared up for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025, excitement is building among tech geeks, developers, and iPhone users. Packed with promises to be one of the biggest WWDC conferences so far, Apple is expected to introduce the most awaited iOS 26 , the future mobile operating system for iPhones. According to reports by BGR, the keynote is speculated to highlight breakthrough developments that not only improves the user experience but will also be compatible with artificial intelligence, has fluidity between cross-devices, and has a more intelligent design philosophy.Even though Apple has not publicly announced all the features, the leaks and rumors within the industry indicate a bright outlook. With AI-driven health recommendations to live translation through AirPods, iOS 26 will embark on a new path in making the iPhone smarter, smarter, and more personal.Listed below are the rumoured iOS 26 features that could completely transform your iPhone.One of the largest issues with beta software over the past few years has been instability during initial releases. Apple is said to be focusing heavily on foundational performance boosts and more refined beta testing cycles with iOS 26. This translates to fewer bugs, improved resource efficiency, and a cleaner experience across models.iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro. The new design is speculated to come with translucent features, more simplified menus, and a less prominent interface.Over the years, the Camera app has become a bit troublesome with a lot of toggles and buried options. With iOS 26, Apple can finally simplify this interface, providing a more smooth and distraction-free shooting experience.Fitness and health have been at the heart of Apple's world, but iOS 26 might take it to the next level with the launch of an AI health coach. This would take user information from the Health app and Apple Watch and create personalized fitness and wellness advice.Battery life remains a priority for iPhone users. Apple can solve this with AI-driven battery optimisation, where the operating system learns user habits and optimizes background activity accordingly.Accessing public Wi-Fi, particularly captive networks that demand login screens, can become a chore. iOS 26 might bring a shared login feature that is synced across devices with the same Apple ID.Perhaps the most awaited feature is real-time translation support in AirPods, which would possibly be driven by Apple Intelligence (Apple's own AI suite).From an improved battery life to smarter health tracking and real-time translation, the upcoming iOS 26 features seem aimed at making the iPhone not just a device, but a more intuitive extension of daily life. Stay tuned for Apple’s keynote, where all eyes will be on how many of these speculations actually become reality.","iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro.

How Nietzsche and God helped this Israeli hostage survive in the tunnels of Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-nietzsche-and-god-helped-this-israeli-hostage-survive-in-the-tunnels-of-gaza/articleshow/121756435.cms,"Omer Shem Tov ’s Psalm 20 and Nietzsche’s “Why”



Putin's Revenge: Dramatic Footage Shows Russian Su-34 Bombers Blowing Up Ukrainian Launchpads

The Rediscovery of Faith in Captivity



Nietzsche Underground



The Fragility of Life, the Tenacity of Faith







More than a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche famously declared that “God is dead.” But in the fetid, pitch-dark tunnels beneath Gaza—where air was scarce, food scarce still, and the future nearly absent—God and Nietzsche coexisted.For dozens of Israeli hostages taken during Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, attack, survival meant something more than physical endurance. Inside those underground cells, belief returned with unexpected force—sometimes in the form of sacred verses from the Book of Psalms, other times through the secular wisdom of Nietzsche’s existential despair. What united them was the same core truth: the need for meaning, for something to hold onto when everything else—light, freedom, identity—was stripped away.Omer Shem Tov, 20 at the time of his abduction, had been a secular Israeli, waiting tables and planning a post-army trip to South America. He was seized at the Nova music festival, along with friends, and quickly spirited into the Gaza tunnel network—lowered underground in a plastic tub.Days into his captivity, without access to clocks or sunlight, Shem Tov began to pray. He clung to Psalm 20—“May the Lord answer you on a day of distress”—a passage that, by eerie coincidence, his mother was reciting back home in Herzliya, unaware her son had adopted the same verse as his mantra.For him, faith didn’t emerge as sudden revelation, but as necessity—a response to isolation, uncertainty, and fear. He began blessing his food, making promises to God, and vowed to don tefillin in prayer if he ever returned home.But if God gave him ritual, Nietzsche offered something else: a reason to endure. A saying frequently repeated among hostages was drawn from the German philosopher, popularised by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl: “He who has a why can bear with any how.” It had reportedly been spoken by Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American hostage, before he was executed by his captors. The phrase reverberated through the tunnels like scripture. One hostage later had it tattooed on his arm.Shem Tov wasn’t alone in finding God in Gaza. Other hostages, like Eli Sharabi—who survived 491 days in captivity only to learn that his wife and two daughters had been killed—described saying the Shema Yisrael prayer each night and attempting to recite the kiddush over water when wine wasn’t available.Ritual became resistance. For many, Jewish observance wasn’t imposed by identity politics or external pressure—it was personal, a lifeline in the most dehumanising conditions imaginable. One hostage described saving a bottle of grape-flavoured drink for the Sabbath prayer. Others placed their hands on their heads in lieu of skullcaps. To the captors, it may have seemed like theatre. To the hostages, it was meaning.And yet, alongside God, Nietzsche endured. Stripped of everything familiar, hostages turned to a philosopher who had buried God in the pages of The Gay Science but also taught generations that suffering could be endured if one had a reason. In the absence of hope, they made purpose. In the absence of time, they made ritual.Even Shem Tov’s captors unwittingly played a role. After an Israeli military unit passed above ground, the gunmen handed Shem Tov reading material they had recovered—suspecting hidden codes. Among the texts: religious literature, and a printed card of Psalm 20. No names, no signatures. Just the verse. It mirrored the exact same card that had been handed to his mother months earlier by a hostage support group.At one point, Shem Tov spent 50 days in a dark, suffocating tunnel cell. He was given a biscuit a day, a few drops of brackish water, and suffered asthma attacks that went nearly untreated. In desperation, he begged God to move him—anywhere else. Within minutes, his captors relocated him to a better chamber. Whether miracle or coincidence, he saw it as divine intervention.From there, he survived through quiet cooperation—cleaning, cooking, helping clear debris after tunnel collapses. He maintained the Sabbath. He saved a bottle of drink for a moment of blessing. He kept faith alive in a place designed to crush it.Now home, he prays daily with tefillin, just as he promised. He has toured Jewish communities in the US, speaking not only of suffering but of resilience. His mother, too, now observes the Sabbath. Theirs is not a tale of religious conversion, but of rediscovery—of how stripped of society’s noise, ancient traditions and modern philosophy became tools of survival.","Omer Shem Tov, 20 at the time of his abduction, had been a secular Israeli, waiting tables and planning a post-army trip to South America.

A Smoother Journey for All: Beyond Just Savings





As the mercury rises and summer travel plans ignite, Dubai International (DXB) is making journeys smoother and more affordable for thousands of outbound passengers. In a strategic move perfectly timed for the bustling season, Dubai Airports has announced a significant reduction in long-term parking fees across all its terminals. This initiative comes as DXB prepares for one of its busiest periods, expecting to welcome and wave off an astounding 250,000 passengers daily throughout June, a clear indicator of the upcoming travel surge.Designed to ease the financial burden of extended trips and, crucially, to alleviate congestion at drop-off zones, this special offer is now live. From June 10 to June 30, travellers utilizing Terminal 1 Car Park B, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 at DXB can take full advantage of these newly reduced long-stay parking rates.Under this compelling new offer, long-term travellers now have access to exceptional value:These updated rates represent a substantial saving compared to the standard tariffs, providing a much-needed sense of relief and peace of mind for UAE residents embarking on extended vacations abroad.The introduction of these discounted rates is more than just an enticing offer; it's an integral part of Dubai Airports' broader strategy to significantly enhance passenger flow and streamline the entire airport experience during its peak operating season.By offering compelling prices for official airport parking, the airport is actively encouraging travellers to choose designated parking facilities over curbside drop-offs. This deliberate shift aims to markedly reduce the often-frustrating traffic bottlenecks that can occur at terminal entrances, ensuring a less stressful start to any journey.Furthermore, the benefits of this summer offer extend beyond just those flying out. Visitors arriving at DXB specifically to pick up incoming guests are also advised to utilize the airport’s designated car parks or convenient valet services. Importantly, these visitors too can now benefit from the very same reduced parking rates under the summer promotion.","Travellers can now park for up to two weeks for just Dh300 across all DXB terminals.

"Don't miss it: UAE's Strawberry Moon, last chance until 2043! When & where to see it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dont-miss-it-uaes-strawberry-moon-last-chance-until-2043-when-where-to-see-it/articleshow/121752387.cms,"The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE from approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 until 5:55 AM on June 12 (Representational Image)

The Lunar Arrival: Times and What to Expect

Best Views: Where to Look Up

Why until 2043: A Rare Lunar Standstill





As the sun dips below the horizon on Tuesday, a rare and truly stunning sight awaits those gazing at the sky across the UAE: the Strawberry Moon, the last full Moon of Spring 2025. This particular moon event holds special meaning, confirmed to be visible throughout the Emirates, not least because it's the last time this specific phenomenon will appear so remarkably low in the sky until the year 2043. For anyone eager to witness nature’s grand show, tomorrow, June 11, offers a chance not to be missed.The exact times for this heavenly display have been carefully set. Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, Operations Manager at the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), told Gulf News on Tuesday, June 10, that ""The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE, with moonrise at approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 and moonset at 5:55 AM on June 12."" This generous time frame, stretching from evening twilight into the early morning, gives plenty of opportunity for viewing. Importantly, Khadijah Hasan Ahmed also confirmed that the Strawberry Moon will indeed be visible everywhere in the UAE, easing any worries about where to see it. The best part, she stressed, is how easy it is to watch: ""And the best part is that you don’t need any special equipment to see it.""For residents wanting the most impressive views of this lunar wonder, simplicity is key. You can simply step outside and look towards the eastern horizon soon after the moonrise at 7:32 PM.The Strawberry Moon is expected to be seen with just your eyes, assuming the skies are clear. Khadijah Hasan Ahmed suggested that the best places to watch are usually wide, open areas like peaceful beaches, the vastness of the desert, or elevated spots that offer a clear view. Even in the city, the Moon can still be seen if you have a clear line of sight to the eastern horizon. While looking with your bare eyes is a wonderful experience, she thoughtfully added, ""Of course, using binoculars or telescopes would definitely enhance the view,"" promising an even more detailed look at the Moon’s surface.This particular moon event, as highlighted by Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, is ""a beautiful, easy-to-watch celestial event that connects us with the universe."" She warmly described the Strawberry Moon as the final full moon of Spring and ""one of the most visually striking, often appearing larger and more golden when it rises."" It's important, however, to remember its name doesn't mean its color: despite its appealing name, the Strawberry Moon will not actually look pink or red. Its usual color, affected by air conditions when it's low on the horizon, is typically a warm yellow or a bright orange.The true charm and compelling reason not to miss this Full Strawberry Moon on June 11 comes from its connection to a truly rare natural event: a Great Lunar Standstill. This significant alignment of the Moon happens only once every 18.6 years, making tomorrow's event an exceptionally rare pairing.Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, using information from the astronomy app Star Walk 2, explained the phenomenon's different effects in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres: ""In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be the lowest Full Moon until 2043, staying unusually close to the horizon. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, it will be the highest Full Moon until 2043."" This precise and rare position is directly due to the major lunar standstill cycle. ""It’s like the Moon’s version of a solstice,"" she clarified, offering an easy comparison for its unique path.To be clear, For those in the Northern Hemisphere, including the UAE, this particular Full Moon on June 11 will be the lowest seen in 18.6 years. It'll rise and set at its farthest points to the southeast and southwest. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the opposite: they'll see their highest Full Moon this month, with their lowest coming in December. This happens because the Moon's orbit is tilted about 5.1 degrees compared to Earth's path. When this tilt combines with Earth's own 23.4-degree tilt during a major standstill, the Moon appears at its most extreme positions. This complex interplay means the June 11 Strawberry Moon isn't just a pretty sight; it's a rare cosmic event that won't appear this low again for almost two decades.","The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE from approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 until 5:55 AM on June 12. This particular moon event holds special meaning, not least because it's the last time this specific phenomenon will appear so remarkably low in the sky until the year 2043.

Thesystem at Mall of the Emirates (MoE) in Dubai began on February 3, 2025. Over the weekend before launch, motorists who visited the mall received notifications regarding the implementation of the new system, which had already been activated at Deira City Centre in January, according to developer Majid Al Futtaim (MAF).The introduction of this paid parking system was first announced in October 2024 after MAF entered into a five-year contract with Parkin PJSC, the largest operator of paid public parking facilities in Dubai. Using Parkin’s seamless parking technology, the new system removes the need for barriers or tickets, allowing motorists to drive in and out without stopping or waiting.Despite the upgrade, MAF confirmed parking fees remain unchanged, stating:“Our new seamless parking upgrade promises a ticketless and barrierless experience so you can efficiently enter and exit hassle-free without any delays or concerns about lost tickets.”A key new update relates to unauthorised use of the MoE parking lot as a traffic shortcut. Some motorists have been passing through the parking area to bypass congestion in Al Barsha’s internal roads and gain quicker access to Sheikh Zayed Road.To address this, MAF has clarified that even simply passing through the Mall of the Emirates parking area is now subject to a flat charge of Dh3.Parkin’s automated camera system scans license plates to track entry and exit times.There is no need for paper tickets or mobile apps.Motorists can extend or waive their parking charges under specific conditions. These must be validated at designated customer service counters:MAF said: “There is no need to register or sign up if the vehicle is already registered in the UAE.”The system is fully integrated with UAE vehicle registration data.MAF has assured that:MAF said their system has a 99.99% accuracy rate in reading number plates.“In the unlikely scenario this happens, the motorist won't be charged,” the company added.Motorists can report issues to 800-Park (7275) or visit the Mall Customer Service Desk for help.","Motorists do not need to stop at any barriers on entry or exit. First 4 hours of parking are free on weekdays. After the 4-hour window, charges apply and an SMS with a payment link is sent to the mobile number linked to the vehicle’s registration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121705343,imgsize-1135353,width-400,resizemode-4/121705343.jpg"

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Enter your beneficiary ID, password, and captcha, then click 'Sign In.' To create and link your ABHA ID, hover your mouse over the 'Update' menu and click on ""Create/Link ABHA ID."" If you're creating an ABHA ID for family members, ensure each family member is mapped after the main cardholder logs in through the ""Beneficiary login."" Select ""I don’t have an ABHA number."" Enter your Aadhaar number, review the terms and conditions, and provide your consent. In the subsequent step, input the OTP sent to your mobile number registered with Aadhaar and click 'Verify OTP.' You'll see the 'Link Status' option. If the details match, you can print the ABHA card by selecting 'print ABHA card.'

If you already have an ABHA number, follow these steps to link it with your CGHS beneficiary ID:

Log in to the CGHS website using your beneficiary ID and password, following the same process as mentioned above until Step 4. After Step 4, click on the 'Link Using ABHA Number' option and enter your ABHA number. Review the consent collection form carefully and provide your consent. Select the 'Get OTP' option, and an OTP will be sent to your mobile number registered with Aadhaar. Enter the OTP and click 'Verify OTP.'

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal: What happens to interest?



EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct. Attach any required documents, like a cancelled cheque, ID proof, address proof, or other relevant documents.4.Make sure your Know Your Customer (KYC) data, such as Aadhaar, PAN, and bank account details, are up-to-date and linked to your EPF account.5.Confirm that your nomination information is current and your member profile is updated.Before you file an EPF claim, ensure that you've checked and resolved the following:- Correct mismatch in name- Correct mismatch in date of birth- Use the correct application form- Complete KYC- Avoid joint bank accounts- Correct bank account errors- Verify the date of joining and leaving- Link UAN with AadhaarYou can withdraw from your EPF account either entirely or in parts. After you retire or if you're unemployed for over two months, you can take out all of your EPF savings. However, you can also make partial withdrawals under specific conditions. According to the EPFO, you won't lose any interest because it's calculated according to the policy.This means that EPF members will not lose any interest due to the withdrawal process. The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

HP EliteBook Ultra Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Google Cloud ’s chief technology officer, Will Grannis , believes the fundamentals of computer science remain vital—even as the tech industry undergoes dramatic changes driven by artificial intelligence . In a recent interview with Business Insider, Grannis said “You still have to understand, you know, how computers work, how data stores work.” “Because that context will allow you to think about how you design something for efficiency and value,” he further added.Grannis emphasized that a traditional computer science degree or coding program is still a solid foundation for entering the tech workforce.He said professionals need to prepare for the era of agentic AI, where understanding the data, tools, and systems behind the AI is just as important as the user inputs.“You're moving from like in the old days, we had to think about it at the application layer and just kind of stop there,” Grannis said. “Now, we’re entering the era of context engineering.”“So it’s not just about prompts,” he added, “but what data, what tools, what systems does your AI, does your multi-agent system need in order to function correctly?”While Grannis stands by the value of formal education, he also encouraged job seekers to learn beyond the curriculum. He said today’s tech professionals should adopt modern tools and systems to keep pace with AI's rapid evolution.“That's what I've been doing my entire career,” he said. “Formal education wouldn't have been enough for me to stay current.”He gave an example of his approach, revealing that he’s encouraging his global team to use AI during an upcoming hackathon. “We're going to use AI to just generate code, to modify it, to steer it, to refine it,” Grannis explained.He also warned that mastering prompt engineering alone isn't enough, saying that while it's important, it has started to become ""boilerplate code.""","Google Cloud’s chief technology officer, Will Grannis, believes the fundamentals of computer science remain vital.

Next year brings Xbox's 25th anniversary celebration

[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 & Grounded 2 Direct

Microsoft just wrapped up their biggest gaming showcase of the year, and honestly? They came loaded for bear. From brand new handhelds to surprise Final Fantasy drops, this wasn't your typical ""here's what's coming eventually"" presentation. The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.The show's theme was clear: Xbox wants to be everywhere you are, whether that's your couch, your desk, or apparently now in your backpack. With every announced game supporting Xbox Play Anywhere and a shiny new handheld to show off, Microsoft is doubling down on their ""play anywhere"" philosophy in a big way.Let's break down everything that happened during this gaming extravaganza.The biggest hardware surprise came courtesy of Microsoft's partnership with Asus. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X aren't just another Steam Deck competitor, they’re Microsoft's direct answer to handheld PC gaming. Both the Ally(s) run full Windows, meaning you can access Xbox Game Pass, Steam, Battle.net, and pretty much any PC storefront you can think of.The regular Ally packs an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, while the Ally X steps things up with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme, 24GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage. Both launch this holiday season, and Microsoft made sure to mention that every game shown in the showcase will run on these handhelds. That's a bold claim, but if it holds true, these could be game-changers for portable gaming.After years of waiting, Obsidian's space RPG sequel has locked in October 29, 2025 as its launch date. The new trailer showed off the colony of Arcadia, which looks like it's having a significantly worse time than the locations in the first game. Rifts are tearing through space-time, factions are at each other's throats, and somehow capitalism is still the real villain.The sequel promises bigger RPG systems, more reactive storytelling, and full character customisation. Plus, there's an expanded Direct happening right after the showcase, so Obsidian clearly has a lot more to show. If you enjoyed the original's blend of dark humour and corporate satire, this looks like more of exactly what you want.October 21, 2025 marks the return of one of gaming's most brutally difficult action series. Ninja Gaiden 4 is a collaboration between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, which sounds like a recipe for some absolutely bonkers combat sequences. The trailer showcased new protagonist Yakumo pulling off impossible combos against hordes of enemies, with the signature weapon-switching and aerial juggling the series is known for.The game is set in near-future Tokyo, features connections to series legend Ryu Hayabusa, and promises to deliver that ""git gud or go home"" difficulty the franchise built its reputation on. If you've been missing proper character action games, this one's shaping up to be essential.Sometimes the most unexpected announcements hit the hardest, and Super Meat Boy 3D definitely qualifies. Sluggerfly and Headup Games are taking Team Meat's masochistic masterpiece and literally adding another dimension to the suffering. The early 2026 release promises all the wall-jumping, buzzsaw-dodging, death-filled gameplay that made the original a cult classic, except now you can fail spectacularly in three dimensions instead of two.The trailer showcased the same tight platforming mechanics that turned controllers into projectiles worldwide, complete with Meat Boy's quest to rescue his bandage-wrapped girlfriend from that eternally creepy fetus in a jar. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously hitting ""retry"" for the 500th time – and honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way.InXile's ambitious RPG got an extended look, and it's looking appropriately ambitious. Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, players discover that history itself has been manipulated by the city's ruler. Your solution? A time travel device that lets you hop into the past and change things, with consequences rippling forward into the present.The new trailer focused on the grittier side of Avalon, showing the downtrodden areas where gangs prey on the weak. It's a far cry from the polished upper city areas we've seen before, suggesting the game will have some real social commentary alongside its time-bending mechanics. No release date yet, but this is definitely one to watch.The final reveal of the show was perhaps the biggest surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, set in 2035. This isn't your typical modern warfare setup; the trailer suggested heavy sci-fi elements, psychological warfare, and the return of David Mason from Black Ops 2. The year 2035 apparently isn't going great for humanity, with the world ""on the brink of chaos"" following the events of previous Black Ops games.Treyarch and Raven Software are promising co-op campaign support, near-future weaponry, and the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies. The official reveal is coming this summer, but this teaser suggests the series is taking some big swings with its setting and tone.Sometimes the best announcements are the ones you can play immediately. Gears of War: Reloaded launches August 26, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can jump into a multiplayer beta starting June 13. This definitive edition of the original Gears features 4K textures, 60 FPS campaign, 120 FPS multiplayer, and full cross-play support.The remaster is coming to more platforms than any Gears game before it, including PlayStation 5. It's a smart move from Microsoft, using one of their biggest exclusives to showcase their multi-platform strategy while giving longtime fans the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.Obsidian's surprise sequel announcement came with an immediate Early Access date, July 29, 2025. Grounded 2 moves the action from a single backyard to the larger Brookhollow Park, featuring new biomes, new bugs, and one of the community's most requested features: rideable vehicles called Buggies.The game promises major quality-of-life improvements over the original, including an all-in-one Omni-Tool that should streamline the building and crafting systems. With over 25 million players shaping the first game's development, this sequel feels like a direct response to community feedback.In the showcase's biggest surprise drop, Final Fantasy XVI is available on Xbox platforms right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. The game that many considered a permanent PlayStation exclusive just became part of Xbox's catalog, complete with Xbox Play Anywhere support and cross-save functionality.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is following this winter, meaning Xbox players will soon have access to some of the most acclaimed JRPGs of recent years. Microsoft made sure to point out that every mainline single-player Final Fantasy is now playable on Xbox platforms, which is a pretty impressive collection to have.Three RPGs caught attention for their unique approaches to familiar genres. Aniimo is an open-world creature collecting game that lets players actually transform into the creatures they capture through something called the Twining system. It's hitting 2026 with a closed beta coming later this year.Aphelion from Don't Nod (Life is Strange, Jusant) is a sci-fi adventure about an astronaut stranded on a frozen planet. What makes it special is its partnership with the European Space Agency, promising gameplay grounded in real science. Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak takes players to post-apocalyptic Japan with a cursed protagonist and her loyal dog companion fighting massive creatures.All three games are coming in 2026.Quarter Up announced Invincible VS , a 3v3 tag fighter based on the hit comic and animated series. The trailer showed appropriately brutal superhero combat with characters like Mark, Thula, and Atom Eve beating the absolute stuffing out of each other. It's coming in 2026 and looks like it could scratch that Marvel vs. Capcom itch.Mudang: Two Hearts is a tactical action game set in a reunified Korea, following a North Korean operative and a K-pop idol whose paths cross during terrorist attacks. The cinematic presentation and Unreal Engine 5 visuals make it one to watch for 2026.Persona 4 Revival got the briefest of teases, literally about seven seconds of footage, but it's enough to confirm that Atlus is giving the beloved JRPG a full remake treatment. No release date yet, but seeing those updated visuals of Inaba was enough to get fans excited.Three major Xbox exclusives are getting substantial content drops. The Elder Scrolls Online is continuing its Worm Cult storyline with new content arriving June 18. Fallout 76 added fishing with the Gone Fission update, because apparently even post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers need to relax sometimes.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting The Order of Giants DLC on September 4, taking Indy beneath the streets of Rome for a new adventure.The most anticipated indie game of the decade got its briefest of mentions, but sometimes that's all you need to send a fanbase into overdrive. Hollow Knight: Silksong appeared during the ROG Xbox Ally segment with a simple promise: it'll be available ""at launch and in Game Pass"" when the handheld arrives later this year. No new footage, no release date, just the confirmation that Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel is still breathing.The game's developer quickly clarified that Silksong isn't tied to the console's release and will arrive ""before Holiday,"" which has fans cautiously optimistic that Christmas 2025 might finally deliver the Metroidvania sequel they've been waiting years for. After countless delays and radio silence, even this tiny update feels like a victory for the Silksong faithful who've been subsisting on hope and memes for far too long.Phil Spencer closed the show by looking ahead to 2026 and Xbox's 25th anniversary. The confirmed lineup includes a new Fable, the next Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and what Spencer called ""the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning."" Most fans are interpreting that last tease as Halo-related, possibly a Combat Evolved remake or remaster.It's a strong lineup for Xbox's quarter-century celebration, mixing beloved franchises with what sounds like a major nostalgic announcement. Whether it's Halo or something else entirely, Spencer clearly saved the biggest tease for last.","The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Apple announced its latest operating system – iOS 26 at the Worldwide Developers conference (WWDC) 2025 event recently. The update brings the all-new Liquid Glass design to iPhones along with other features like improved communication with redesigned Phone and Messages apps and more personalization to the Lock Screen and Home Screen. With iOS 26, Apple has significantly revamped the battery section, offering users a deeper understanding of how their iPhone usage affects battery life. Here’s what changesThe iOS 26 update introduces new analytics, smarter app breakdowns, and improved power management tools — all aimed at helping users extend their daily charge. Now located at the top of the Battery section in Settings is a real-time readout showing the current charge level along with the time of the last charge. If the phone is plugged in, it also displays the estimated time remaining for a full charge.One of the most notable changes is the redesigned usage breakdown. Apple has removed the previous 24-hour and 10-day tabs and replaced them with a single weekly view. This new layout compares current usage to your average, letting you know whether you're consuming more, less, or the same amount of battery as usual.Users can also review app-by-app battery consumption. iOS 26 now indicates whether an app spent more time onscreen, ran longer in the background, or triggered more notifications than normal—making it easier to spot what’s draining the battery.You can scroll back through the past seven days to examine daily usage, split between active screen time and idle screen time, along with charge times and durations.Apple has retained the Battery Health section, which includes details like charge cycles and maximum capacity. Meanwhile, the Charge Limit feature still allows users to cap charging at 80% to preserve battery health.In addition, iOS 26 introduces a new Adaptive Power Mode. This feature automatically detects when iPhone usage is higher than usual and subtly adjusts performance—like dimming the display or reducing background activity—to stretch battery life without user input. Low Power Mode also remains available as a manual toggle.The enhanced battery tools are rolling out with iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, though they do not yet apply to Macs. The developer beta is currently live, with a public beta expected next month. The official release is slated for September.","Apple announced its latest operating system – iOS 26 at the Worldwide Developers conference (WWDC) 2025 event.

Grok gets vision capabilities

Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI is hiring engineers to build Grok app for both Windows and Mac laptops. Igor Babuschkin – co-founder and an engineer at xAI reposted a tweet by Sulaiman Khan Ghori - member of technical staff at the company that says: “Hiring engineers at @xai to help build our Mac product. If you have a track record of writing high-performance Swift and AppKit applications, would love to chat!”. “Join us to work on the X/Grok macOS app,” Babuschkin wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).Tesla CEO and xAI owner Elon Musk reshared Babuschkin’s post. “We’re building both macOS and Windows apps. Can’t live in the browser forever!,” he wrote on X.Earlier this year in February, Musk announced that Grok chatbot will soon be available as a standalone app for both Apple’s’ macOS and Microsoft’s Windows operating systems for PCs. In the post, Musk then wrote: “Grok will also be offered as a standalone application for the MacOS and Windows.”In April, the company released new update to its Grok chatbot, enabling it to “see” the world around it. This new feature allows the chatbot to process and interpret visual inputs, marking a significant leap in AI-human interaction.The enhanced Grok chatbot uses advanced computer vision technology to analyse images and videos, providing context-aware responses. For instance, users can upload a photo of a product, and Grok can identify it, suggest uses, or even recommend similar items. This capability bridges the gap between text-based AI and real-world applications, making Grok more versatile and intuitive.","Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI is hiring engineers to build Grok app for both Windows and Mac laptops.
