From Oscar-nominated roles to emotional newsletters—Hailee’s journey is more than just stardom

How Hailee Steinfeld is redefining celebrity through emotional honesty and fan-first engagement

Hailee Steinfeld has always been more than a Hollywood actress. From her breakout role in True Grit at just 14 to leading major franchises like Pitch Perfect and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, she’s proven herself as a powerhouse performer. But in 2025, Steinfeld is not only capturing hearts on-screen—she’s reshaping how celebrities connect with their fans through emotional honesty and personal storytelling.Recently, Hailee Steinfeld confirmed her dream to host Saturday Night Live, calling it a “Bucket list” moment in response to a fan’s question in the BEAU SOCIETY newsletter . While the idea of hosting SNL has excited fans, it’s only one piece of a much larger vision.Currently starring in Sinners, a 1930s vampire thriller directed by Ryan Coogler, Steinfeld's deep dive into her character’s mixed-race identity led to personal family discoveries. “It had such an impact on me personally,” she told PEOPLE. “Therefore, I feel like the least it can do is make an impact on those that watch it.”The emotional depth of her performance has resonated with audiences. Speaking on Good Morning America, Steinfeld said, “This character challenged me in ways I’ve never been challenged…” As her career climbs new heights, her personal growth is equally inspiring.Beyond film, Steinfeld has built a community through her direct-to-fan newsletter, BEAU SOCIETY. With topics ranging from identity to heartbreak, Hailee acts more like a brutally honest best friend than a distant celebrity. “Friendships are special and precious and can be tricky because… sometimes you drift apart. That’s okay!” she advised one reader, delivering wisdom that fans have found deeply comforting.After her past relationship with Niall Horan and current romance with Josh, Steinfeld hasn't shied away from sharing breakup lessons. In BEAU SOCIETY, she even recommended Issa Rae and Michelle Obama podcasts, writing: “Trust that you’ll have many best friends throughout your life. Maybe you’re about to meet your next one.”Hailee is changing the game—not just as a performer, but as a deeply relatable voice for a generation navigating love, loss, and self-discovery. As she said herself, “This is just the beginning.” And if that’s true, her future looks every bit as remarkable as her past.Also Read: “Sometimes you drift apart”: Hailee Steinfeld opens up on emotional heartbreak while Josh Allen plays it safe in the background","Hailee Steinfeld is redefining celebrity through emotional honesty and fan-first engagement.

Storyline: A fantasy world

Light No Fire Official Reveal Trailer From Hello Games | The Game Awards 2023

Gameplay tricks and tips

EVERYTHING You Need To Know About Light No Fire In 2025 So Far!!

In the ever-changing landscape of open-world gaming , the creators of No Man's Sky , Hello Games , are setting their sights on a new and bolder frontier. With Light No Fire, the studio is not simply building an exploration game; it attempts to reimagine what it means to survive, explore, and create in a fantasy universe fashioned to mirror Earth in its sheer scale and complexity. And this time, there are no galaxies, only one earth teeming with opportunities.While No Man’s Sky created an entire universe with billions upon billions of procedurally generated planets, Light No Fire zooms up close and personal to the workings of a single handcrafted-and-automatically-procedural-gen planet. But don’t let ""for one"" fool you. Ostensibly called ""multiplayer Earth"" by its creators, the designers propose something vast enough to span hundreds of millions of square miles-the real equivalent area needed to accommodate Earth's population. It's not just a sandbox; it's a continent-spanning wilderness with oceans as deep and dark as ours and mountains towering far beyond what one usually sees in games.While No Man's Sky uses science fiction for style, Light No Fire uses fantasy-far far away in lore, ancient ruins, magical creatures, and gigantic biomes. Players are not mere scavengers or colonists but rather roam freely as adventurers through a land that invites curiosity at every corner. The RPG features include character customization from diverse species, ranging even to anthropomorphic rabbits.Though Light No Fire can be enjoyed by a single player, Hello Games much more strongly stresses the shared experience. This is not just a skill-based competitive survival game. Rather, it is a cooperative effort to settle, explore, and conceptualize a shared vast world. The game's choice of design basically invites players to cooperate in communities and to embark on quests that are given by NPCs sitting in scattered outposts. It is not about domination; it is co-existence.And that is an incredibly meaningful message coming from a studio that has slowly but surely been earning back the trust of gamers since a rocky launch in 2016.Arguably the greatest differentiator with Light No Fire is how the game itself is undergoing revelation. After a host of accusations against the studio for early overhype in past games, Hello Games has learned to extend marketing campaigns. With five years of development already behind it, the studio has quietly been working towards what may well be one of the most extensive and imaginative open-world games of the decade.No release date has ever been announced, but the upper hand still lies with a late-2025 launch. Should Light No Fire live up to at least half of what it intends to do, the magic of discovery in games may just get revived again.","Light No Fire attempts to reimagine what it means to survive, explore, and create in a fantasy universe fashioned to mirror Earth.

Jason Kelce’s post-NFL weight loss journey from 295 to 270 pounds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelces-post-nfl-weight-loss-journey-from-295-to-270-pounds/articleshow/121167483.cms,"Jason Kelce sheds 25 pounds post NFL retirement (Image via: Getty Images)

The real story behind Jason Kelce’s 25-pound post-retirement weight drop



Jason Kelce’s transformation says about post-career identity



Shirtless Jason Kelce Shows Off Almost 30-Pound Weight Loss | E! News

Jason Kelce spent over a decade bulldozing defenders as a 295-pound juggernaut on the Philadelphia Eagles’ offensive line. But now, in retirement, he's fighting a very different battle, one against the very body that made him a football legend. Since hanging up his cleats, Kelce has dropped 25 pounds and counting, and while fans are praising his leaner look, some are wondering: why do so many NFL players feel compelled to erase their on-field physiques as soon as they leave the league?Kelce’s weight loss journey has been anything but quiet. On his popular New Heights podcast, he joked about resembling an “overweight Oompa Loompa” during his playing days, citing his long-time love for burgers, donuts, and pizza. Now, just weeks after revealing he hit 283 pounds, the ex-Eagle told Us Weekly he’s shed even more, hovering around 270, thanks in part to a “body fat loss competition” with former teammate Beau Allen.Kelce isn't the only lineman shedding mass post-retirement. Across the league, a growing number of ex-NFL stars are rapidly transforming their bodies, often within months of stepping off the field. It’s a phenomenon raising questions: Is it about health, or is the league’s obsession with size forcing players to live in unsustainable bodies for the sake of performance and then abandon them for “normalcy” once their contracts end?Kelce himself acknowledged the odd aesthetic shift many linemen face. “They lose too much weight and look like bobbleheads,” he told GQ. “Their necks gets so small, but their heads stay the same size.” For now, Kelce says he’s targeting the 250–265 range, just enough to look “big and happy” without chasing six-pack abs or ditching every comfort food. But the message is murky. Fans cheer when athletes bulk up, and then again when they slim down.Also Read: Madden Biopic: Christian Bale and Nicolas Cage bring NFL legends Al Davis and John Madden to life Kelce’s transformation is inspiring, no doubt. It marks a new chapter in life after football, one where players shift away from the physical demands of the game. They’re not just retiring from the sport; they’re evolving beyond the bodies and routines that once defined them. It’s a powerful reminder that life after the field is just as defining.","Jason Kelce, an offensive lineman for the Philadelphia Eagles, has shed 25 pounds since retiring.

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"



A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.he four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal. Different rules apply for different types of claims, such as PF advances, final settlements, and other reasons.3.Fill out the form carefully and ensure all information is correct.

The interest is calculated from when it's due until the day you withdraw your money. If you withdraw before the interest is officially credited, it will still be added to your account.","EPF members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts.

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community.

All about the Tokyo E-Prix

The Tokyo E-Prix is just around the corner, and it presents yet another opportunity to boost the participation of women in motorsport . Formula E has implemented the FIA Girls on Track program, which aims to raise the percentage of female involvement by inviting young women aged 12 to 18 to explore, free of charge, various facets of motorsport and its industry through a series of activities, workshops, and behind-the-scenes access. Currently, only 1.5 percent of all license holders globally are women.FIA Girls on Track will welcome up to 120 young women during the Tokyo E-Prix race week. The participants will engage in workshops, gaming sessions, career talks, and a Pit Lane walk throughout the event, fostering empowerment and education in motorsport and engineering. The program maintains its emphasis on STEM education and gender inclusivity in motorsport, actively reaching out to girls from diverse backgrounds in each host city.In addition to on-site programming, off-site activities will include an immersive E-Karting masterclass, also open to up to 120 young women. This initiative is designed to offer hands-on experience and exposure to E-Karting, aligning with Formula E’s broader social impact mission of involving and engaging local communities at every race location.Japanese-American racing driver and content creator Hana Burton, along with active rally driver Maaya Orido—who competes in the XCR Sprint Cup Hokkaido and Rally Hokkaido—will also be present at the event. The FIA Girls on Track program is proudly supported by Hankook (Presenting Partner), ABB (Principal Partner), and Fortescue Zero (Official Partner).This marks the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix, following its debut last year. In that race, Maximilian Günther of Maserati MSG Racing took the win, while Nissan’s Oliver Rowland finished second after starting from pole position.

The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences.
