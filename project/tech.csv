The tension escalated when the American pilot urgently asked, ""Wait, who's cleared to take off on 28?""Realizing the mistake, ATC frantically instructed the American pilot to abort the landing and ""go around."" Following this command, the American jet ascended, but its flight path took it directly over the runway from which the Delta flight was taking off.For a chilling moment, the two planes were on a collision course, passing within 725 feet of each other.The dash camera footage captured this nerve-wracking encounter, making it appear as though the planes were seconds away from disaster.As the American flight climbed to about 1,825 feet, it crossed paths with the Delta jet, which was also ascending. At one point, the planes were only 675 feet apart vertically and just 425 feet horizontally, a terrifyingly close call.Delta confirmed that Flight 5421, bound for New York City, was carrying 76 passengers and four crew members. American Airlines reported that Flight 5511, en route from Washington, DC, had 75 passengers and four crew members on board.Miraculously, no injuries occurred.The FAA has launched an investigation to determine what went wrong.Delta said, ""Endeavor Air and Delta will work with aviation authorities as we always do in our shared commitment to safety above all else."" American Airlines also confirmed the incident, deferring further comments to the FAA's ongoing probe.","The incident occurred at around 11.50 am EDT on Monday, as two regional jets navigated through an apparent traffic control blunder at Syracuse Hancock International Airport.

Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions.This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

How Google is using its latest Gemini AI model to train robots “navigate the world”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-is-using-its-latest-gemini-ai-model-to-train-robots-navigate-the-world/articleshow/111668165.cms,"How Google trained a robot on Gemini 1.5 AI model

Google , at I/O 2024, showcased multimodal capabilities in the Gemini 1.5 AI model. This means that the large language model can take photos, videos and audio, along with text, as inputs, process that information and generate responses. The company’s AI unit is now leveraging this capability to train robots to navigate their surroundings.Google Deepmind recently published a research paper, and a bunch of clips detailing how a robot can be trained and can understand multimodal instructions, including natural language and image, and perform useful navigation.“To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video,” Google said, adding that the advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal.In a threat shared on X (formerly Twitter), Google noted that since a limited context length makes it a challenge for many AI models to recall environments, Gemini’s 1.5 Pro’s 1 million token context length helped the company to train robots for navigation.Robots “can use human instructions, video tours, and common sense reasoning to successfully find their way around a space,” it said.The trainers took the robots on a tour of specific areas in a real-world setting, and in the process highlighted key places to recall. Then, they were asked to lead us to these locations.For example, in an office setting, a robot can be trained to be a guide. It can be made to learn the location of the company’s Chairman’s office, canteen area or play area, and so on. When guests come to meet a company executive, they can ask the robot to “take me to the Chairman’s office” and it will oblige. Similarly, new joinees may ask the robot to take them to the canteen, and it can guide the employee to the location.“The system’s architecture takes in these inputs and then creates a topological graph - or a simplified representation of a space. This is constructed from frames within tour videos, which captures the general connectivity of their surroundings to find a path without a map,” Google Deepmind said.As per Google, the company evaluated the output in an office and a home-like environment, and achieved 86% and 90% success rates, respectively.“In the future, users could simply record a tour of their environment with a smartphone for their personal robot assistant to understand and navigate,” the company added.","Google showcased multimodal capabilities in the Gemini 1.5 AI model.

Amazon’s cloud unit, Amazon Web Services ( AWS ), kicked off its annual summit in New York. The company announced a bunch of product developments, including some AI refinements as it competes with companies like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Facebook-parent Meta .AI chatbots have seen a meteoric rise in recent times with tech giants providing tools and platforms to create them on a requirement basis, allowing them to create chatbots that undertake specific tasks.On similar lines, Amazon launched App Studio – a generative AI-driven service that will help enterprise users to create scalable internal apps by simply describing what they need in natural language. The service is available under a limited preview.“The new AWS App Studio—a generative AI-powered, low-code (meaning the code-writing is mostly done for you) application building service—is the easiest way to create secure applications that can solve business problems in minutes, instead of days or weeks,” the company said.For example, users can say, “Build an app to review and approve invoices” to track inventory. App Studio will generate the new application, including a user interface for listing invoices, a data model for the approval records, and a system for routing those records, Amazon explained.Amazon said it is adding memory to AI agents that automate work for businesses“This allows agents to provide more personalised and more seamless experiences, especially for complicated tasks,” said Vasi Philomin, Amazon's vice president of generative AI , as per Reuters. For example, the updated AI agents can remember a user’s requests that he/ she prefers aisle or window seats on a flight, which was not previously possible.Amazon has also updated the Q chatbot to make improved suggestions for writing software code.","Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, kicked off its annual summit in New York.

Apple avoids threat of fines from EU regulators on contactless payments technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-avoids-threat-of-fines-from-eu-regulators-on-contactless-payments-technology/articleshow/111666940.cms,"What’s the Apple Pay investigation all about

Apple has agreed to open its tap-and-go payments system to rivals in Europe, European Union antitrust regulator has said. This means that the iPhone maker will avoid the threat of fines by allowing rival wallet developers to use contactless mobile payments technology of Apple Pay for 10 years.“The Commission has decided to accept commitments offered by Apple.These commitments address our preliminary concerns that Apple may have illegally restricted competition for mobile wallets on iPhones,” said European Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the EU’s competition division.“Apple has until July 25 to implement their commitments. As of this date, developers will be able to offer a mobile wallet on the iPhone with the same 'tap and go' experience that so far has been reserved for Apple Pay,” she added.In 2020, the EU launched an antitrust investigation, looking at the terms and conditions Apple sets for integrating Apple Pay in apps and websites. The probe concerned the 'tap and go' technology that uses Near-Field Communication (NFC) and alleged refusals of accessing Apple Pay.Then in 2022, the EU Commission raised concerns that Apple Pay's dominance on iPhones effectively excluded other mobile wallet providers, thereby restricting competition.“Our preliminary finding was therefore that Apple abused its dominant position by refusing to supply the NFC technology to competing mobile wallet developers,” the Commission mentioned.In the settlement, the EU accepted commitments offered by Apple over how it operates Apple Pay to end a long-running competition investigation. This means that iPhone users in the region will be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores.“They will be able to do so while enjoying all the iPhone's functionalities, including tap-and-go, Double-Click and FaceID,” the Commission added.Meanwhile, Vestager said the iPhone maker has yet to change its business practices to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires Big Tech to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice.","Apple has agreed to open its tap-and-go payments system to rivals in Europe.

“My family. I took those who no one wanted. The discarded, the forgotten. I gave them a purpose. They're so happy that you remembered them. Because being a glutton for punishment doesn't make abandonment hurt any less. Forsaken, alone, begging for mercy as the buzzards circled. There's been loss; too much. But grief is the price you pay for love. But now, we must set the captives free, so they need no master. Do you think I... Do you think we are sick?""

This week on WWE RAW , Bo Dallas found his way into Adam Pearce’s office with a rather interesting proposition for SummerSlam . Based on the exchange between the two of them, Uncle Howdy could be facing Chad Gable at the biggest event this summer.Bo Dallas hasn’t been seen in the ring since 2019, and has been making sporadic appearances on screen through VHS tapes, alongside his alter ego, Uncle Howdy.With the recent revelation that he indeed is Uncle Howdy, and the leader of the Wyatt Sicks, there’s a high chance that he’ll be competing in the ring very soon.As of now, it’s likely that Uncle Howdy will be competing against Chad Gable at WWE SummerSlam. Furthermore, considering that The Fiend made his debut at the event, Uncle Howdy will follow suit.Earlier in the episode, the commentators found a video that was left for them. The video was equally eerie to all the other tapes featuring Uncle Howdy. In the new video, Dallas says:It’s currently unclear why the newly formed faction is targeting Chad Gable, but it will be worth seeing how WWE plans on executing the storyline for the newly formed Wyatt group, which includes Joe Gacy, Dexter Lumis, Erick Rowan, and Nikki Cross for now.Being present at SummerSlam is going to be beneficial for both parties at this point in time. The Wyatt Sicks and Chad Gable need the exposure that the upcoming event can easily provide. While WWE has not created a very supernatural aura surrounding Uncle Howdy at this point, they could do so in the near future to give the character a new dimension.Also read: Damian Priest Throw Out ‘Gentleman’s Agreement’, offered a rematch to Seth Rollins","Bo Dallas hasn’t been seen in the ring since 2019, and has been making sporadic appearances on screen through VHS tapes, alongside his alter ego, Uncle Howdy.
