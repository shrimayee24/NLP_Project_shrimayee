Ayesha Howard responds to rumored claim about Anthony Edwards’ paying child support for 18 years



Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards recently found himself at the center of an internet firestorm after a rumor claimed he had offered to pay 18 years of child support in advance. The claim originated on X, where a user alleged that Edwards made the staggering offer to Ayesha Howard to settle child support obligations upfront. The rumor quickly spread, with another post asserting that the 23-year-old NBA star had already paid $1,080,000 in a single lump sum.Ayesha Howard swiftly shut down the speculation circulating online. Speaking to The Shade Room, she made it clear that no such arrangement had been made. “There are no court documents, motions, or proceedings that have occurred, nor have I been offered or agreed to such terms,” she stated, directly refuting the viral claim.Howard also took to Instagram to express her frustration over the spread of misinformation, posting a message that read: “You ever heard a rumor about yourself and actually wanted to hear more? Like no way… what did I do next?” She further questioned the origins of the false report, writing, “Where do these lies be coming from?”Edwards was confirmed to be the father of Howard’s daughter, Aubri’ Summers, who was born in October 2024. Paternity was officially determined in December, and by February, Edwards had filed for child custody or visitation rights. However, an agreement between the two parties has yet to be reached.This latest rumor is just one of several controversies surrounding Edwards in recent months. In December 2023, another woman, Paige Jordae, accused the NBA star of pressuring her to terminate a pregnancy. Screenshots allegedly showed Edwards offering $100,000 for her to get an abortion and demanding proof of her taking the pills.Also Read: Anthony Edwards proves that basketball IQ can be as dangerous as athleticism Following public backlash, Edwards issued a statement attempting to walk back his alleged comments. “I made comments in the heat of a moment that are not me, and that are not aligned with what I believe and who I want to be as a man,” he wrote on X. “All women should be supported and empowered to make their own decisions about their bodies and what is best for them.”Edwards has not responded to the online claim.","Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards is the father of Ayesha Howard's daughter, Aubri' Summers.

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments.

To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

Kevin Nash on John Cena’s feelings



""I think all of us, all the boys at some point, as the years go on and it gets towards the end of our runs, that you have like a feeling ... you got used and abused and when you're done man, they just put you out to pasture and so many guys have nothing to show for it.""

""You've been married for 30 years with somebody and then one morning you get up and you've got separate sinks and you just look over, you go, 'I don't want to do this anymore' ... I don't think that resonates in two seconds and I think that's what this is. I think it's got to be a slow burn like that.""

Why did WWE never make John Cena turn into a Heel before



""This is when they would do that, ‘Let’s go, Cena! Cena sucks!’ thing, and it was at its f***ing peak. I just said, ‘God, I’ve never in my life seen anything like this.’ John sold so much merchandise and did so much Make-A-Wish that it was impossible to turn him heel,""

Chelsea Green SLAMS disrespectful fan

""I hate to break it to you, but not only have I shared locker rooms with all genders, I’ve also shared bathrooms. So no, I wouldn’t give a f**k. In fact, I’ve got family members that are trans, so I’ve given not just 10 seconds of thought to this but close to 30 years and 10 seconds of thought. If you’d like to take your bigotry elsewhere, I would greatly appreciate that.""

“Thank you for using your platform to advocate for us.”

That’s my girlllllll right there! Thank you queen for being so outspoken with your support for our trans kings and queens.

Saints’ Pete Werner weds longtime love Emily Chernoff



New Orleans Saints linebacker Pete Werner tied the knot with his high school sweetheart, Emily Chernoff , on March 22, 2025. Held in their hometown of Indianapolis, the wedding was a beautifully orchestrated event that honored both tradition and the couple's journey together.The couple exchanged vows in a traditional Catholic ceremony at St. Joan of Arc Church, where the timeless beauty of stained glass and a grand painting above the altar set a reverent tone. Emily’s entrance was nothing short of magical, walking down what she described as “the longest aisle” in a sparkling Rosa Clará gown with a halter neckline and garza overskirt. Her look was completed with a romantic half-up hairstyle by Salon 1|4 and soft glam makeup by Chelsea Lasiter. Pete, equally dashing in a classic black tuxedo, wore a boutonniere that reflected the wedding’s soft yellow, green, and pastel floral palette curated by Pomp & Bloom.The ceremony concluded with a touch of Irish flair—bagpiper Robert Wood led the recessional and grand church exit, a loving tribute to Emily’s Irish heritage. That same spirit of personalization extended to the elegant ballroom reception at the Scottish Rite Cathedral, where 300 guests gathered to celebrate the couple’s new beginning.“We are so lucky to have made great friendships through the NFL life,” Pete shared with PEOPLE. Their guest list included close friends and former teammates from the Saints and Ohio State Buckeyes, such as Payton Turner, Zack Baun, Sam Hubbard, and more, who added camaraderie and joy to the celebration.The reception unfolded like a vintage Italian garden party, with terracotta tones, soft yellows, and lush greenery adorning the space. Delicate fruit accents and extravagant floral arrangements brought Emily’s vision to life, creating a dream-like atmosphere. A charming New Orleans-inspired floral cart and bistro table offered a nod to Pete’s NFL city, while late-night beignets made sure the Big Easy was never far away.Cocktail hour delighted guests with an indulgent charcuterie spread, shrimp cocktails, and orange chicken bites. Dinner was equally refined, offering guests a plated salad with artisan greens, brie, pears, candied walnuts, and pomegranate vinaigrette, followed by a choice between red wine-braised beef short rib, Atlantic salmon, or a vegetarian bell pepper quinoa pilaf. Meanwhile, the younger crowd was treated to chicken fingers.Adding to the emotional weight of the evening, Emily’s father delivered a heartfelt toast that featured a PowerPoint montage of over 200 photos chronicling the couple’s journey—from their days at Cathedral High School to their recent engagement in March 2024.“Our wedding was truly the best day and night of our lives, filled with so much love,” Emily told PEOPLE. “It felt amazing to see how well both of our families relate, making the day even more memorable.”Also Read: Former Steelers WR Miles Boykin signs with Bears in under-the-radar free agency move An unforgettable afterparty followed at Bottleworks Hotel, capping off a night filled with laughter, tears, and cherished memories.

It was, in every way, a celebration of enduring love—rooted in friendship, strengthened by distance, and sealed in a promise for the future.","New Orleans Saints linebacker Pete Werner tied the knot with his high school sweetheart, Emily Chernoff, on March 22, 2025.
