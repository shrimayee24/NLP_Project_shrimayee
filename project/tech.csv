The rise of AI in healthcare is inevitable, but its role must be clearly defined and carefully regulated. Illinois has taken a groundbreaking step by banning AI platforms like ChatGPT from delivering therapy or mental health assessments without supervision by licensed professionals. Signed into law by Governor JB Pritzker, this legislation addresses growing ethical and safety concerns surrounding AI’s expanding role in mental healthcare. While AI tools offer efficiency and accessibility, they lack the empathy, nuanced understanding, and accountability essential for sensitive mental health support.The law ensures that treatment plans and emotional evaluations remain firmly in human hands, protecting vulnerable individuals from potential harm caused by unregulated AI advice and misdiagnosis. Illinois’ move sets a precedent for responsible AI use in healthcare, emphasising that technology ‘should assist, not replace’ qualified mental health professionals in delivering compassionate, ethical, and effective care.Under the newly introduced Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act, AI chatbots and platforms are strictly prohibited from:Unless these actions are supervised by a licensed mental health professional, they are deemed illegal under state law. Violators of this regulation could face penalties of up to $10,000 per violation, as enforced by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR). The law is designed to ensure that human expertise, emotional intelligence, and ethical standards remain central to the therapy process.With this law, Illinois becomes a trailblazer in responsible AI governance. By defining what AI can and cannot do in healthcare, the state sets a critical precedent for the rest of the nation.Rather than stifle technology, this law ensures that AI development proceeds with ethical boundaries — especially when human lives and emotions are on the line. Illinois is not the only state moving toward regulating AI’s role in therapy. Other states are joining the effort to draw clear lines between acceptable AI use and areas requiring human judgment.These actions reflect a national trend: mental healthcare must prioritise ethics, accountability, and human empathy, even in an AI-driven world.At the heart of this decision is a growing concern that AI lacks the emotional intelligence and ethical grounding necessary for mental health care. While generative AI systems like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities in simulating conversations, they cannot truly understand or respond to human emotions in context, especially during crises, trauma, or complex interpersonal dynamics where empathy, nuance, and moral judgment are crucial for effective support.Mario Treto Jr., Secretary of the IDFPR, said, “The people of Illinois deserve quality healthcare from real, qualified professionals and not computer programs.” This law protects vulnerable individuals from placing trust in a machine that might misunderstand or mishandle emotional crises.The American Psychological Association (APA) has been sounding the alarm since early 2025. In a report to federal regulators, the APA raised serious concerns over AI-driven chatbots pretending to be licensed therapists. These bots, while unregulated, have allegedly caused real-world harm.These events underscore the urgent need to prevent unregulated AI from entering sensitive domains where lives could be at stake.Illinois’ law doesn’t completely ban AI from mental healthcare — rather, it limits its application to non-clinical support roles.AI can still be used for:This approach encourages innovation without sacrificing safety.

Elon Musk’s xAI has introduced Grok Imagine , a powerful new feature in its Grok AI platform that allows users to generate images and short video clips from simple text prompts. What’s making headlines, however, is its controversial “Spicy Mode” — a setting that reportedly enables the creation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, sparking concerns about potential misuse, content moderation, and digital safety.This bold move places xAI in direct competition with major players, intensifying the race to dominate the multimedia generative AI space.

Epic Games is set to roll out Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4 update, titled ""Shock 'N Awesome,"" very soon. However, ahead of the update’s release, the game is going through scheduled global downtime. This downtime is expected to end before the release of the Shock 'N Awesome update, which has rendered the game unplayable for players across the world.

Jet fighters can reach astonishing speeds and perform complex movements, making them a symbol of military power and technological prowess. These aircrafts are designed for precision and dominance in the skies, and some of the fastest jets ever built show remarkable feats of human engineering.From the iconic warplanes like the F-22 Raptor and to NASA’s cutting-edge experimental aircraft X-43, and even the famous F-14 Tomcat , which starred in the Tom Cruise movie Top Gun , these jets depict unbelievable speeds ranging from Mach 2.25 to an unbelievable Mach 9.6, making them a pinnacle of aviation technology. Each aircraft has left a lasting mark on history. Explore the list of ten of the fastest jets ever created in the world according to a BBC report.The F-22 Raptor is a single-seat stealth fighter with formidable capabilities, including a top speed of Mach 2.25 and exceptional long-range cruising ability. Loaded with advanced weaponry, it stands out as a powerful force in modern air combat. However, its cutting-edge stealth technology is so sensitive that the U.S. government prohibits its sale to other countries.Despite its speed and stealth, the F-22 has been outpaced in versatility by the slower F-35 Lightning II.Production of the F-22 was capped at just 187 aircraft, making it a rare sight in modern air fleets.Designed by the USSR to compete with the F-15 Eagle during the Cold War, the MiG-29 Fulcrum is a lightweight fighter with a top speed of Mach 2.3 and a range of 1,500 km on a single tank of fuel. It can also be refuelled mid-air, making it a combat favourite for many air forces.Renowned for its agility, the MiG-29 has seen extensive action over the years and can take off and land on rough runways. With continuous upgrades, it remains in service with numerous countries worldwide.The F-14 Tomcat is perhaps most famous for its starring role in the 1986 movie Top Gun. This two-seater fighter was launched from aircraft carriers, delivering some of the most iconic take-off and landing sequences in aviation history. Powered by two jet engines, it boasts a top speed of Mach 2.34.In service for over 30 years, the F-14 became one of the best-known jets in the world, recognized for its agility and versatile combat capabilities.The MiG-23 Flogger is easily recognizable due to its variable-sweep wing design, which contributes to its exceptional agility in dogfights. Capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.35, this Soviet-era jet was a popular choice for many air forces, with over 5,000 units built over 18 years.Despite being nearly 60 years old, the MiG-23 is still in service in some nations due to its sturdy construction and high performance.Although the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker misses out on the top five, it is renowned for more than just speed, with a top speed of Mach 2.35. This versatile fighter jet features excellent manoeuvrability and a strong operational range, making it a highly valuable aircraft for a variety of missions.The Su-27's rapid ascent ability is legendary, reaching an altitude of 12 km in less than a minute. It remains in production today, over 40 years after its debut.The F-15 Eagle has been in service for nearly 50 years, yet it remains one of the fastest jets, with a top speed of Mach 2.5. Its combination of low weight and high wing area enables it to execute tight turns without losing speed, making it perfect for dogfights. The F-15 has earned its place as a staple at airshows and in combat missions around the world.The MiG-31 Foxhound is one of the oldest jets still in operation, designed as an improvement over the MiG-25 for stability at lower altitudes. Although not as agile as other jets, it compensates with formidable firepower, including long-range missiles, and can reach a top speed of Mach 2.83.Its continued service underscores the success of its design, though its radar detectability limits its stealth capabilities.First introduced nearly 60 years ago, the MiG-25 Foxbat remains one of the fastest fighter jets in existence, with a top speed of Mach 2.83. It was designed during the Cold War as a high-speed interceptor, and its capabilities have ensured its ongoing use in some countries, even though its design is now considered outdated. Over 1,200 MiG-25s were produced, marking it as one of the most successful jet fighters of all time.The SR-71 Blackbird, known for its incredible speed and stealth, was capable of outrunning missiles. When it entered service in 1966, it was a marvel of technology, with a top speed of Mach 3.3. Primarily used for reconnaissance missions during the Cold War, the SR-71 still holds the record for the highest sustained flight altitude at nearly 26 km.NASA was the last operator of the Blackbird, retiring it in 1999. Its rumoured successor, the SR-72, is expected to debut in 2025.NASA's X-43, an experimental scramjet that achieved an unprecedented speed of Mach 9.6, or 11,854 km/h. The X-43 was launched from a Boeing B-52 and only flew for 10 seconds before gliding for 10 minutes and intentionally crashing into the ocean.Despite its short flights, the X-43 remains the fastest jet ever built, showcasing the future of high-speed aircraft design.","The F-22 Raptor is a single-seat stealth fighter with formidable capabilities, including a top speed of Mach 2.25 and exceptional long-range cruising ability. The F-14 Tomcat is perhaps most famous for its starring role in the 1986 movie Top Gun, delivering some of the most iconic take-off and landing sequences in aviation history.

You’ve likely seen these paintings many times, whether on your Instagram reels or during a museum visit. These masterpieces, created by renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Pablo Picasso , reflect the era in which they were painted, offering insights into historical events, cultural shifts, and personal struggles. They are more than just brushstrokes or oil on canvas.From the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa to the haunting Scream by Edvard Munch, and the ethereal beauty of Shakuntala by Raja Ravi Verma, each painting reveals deeper meanings, symbolising the artist’s emotions, societal changes, and the conflicts of their time. Discover the fascinating stories behind these iconic works that have made a solid impact on the world of art here.The enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa has fascinated viewers for centuries. Painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506, it is believed to portray Lisa Gherardini, a merchant’s wife. The painting’s mysterious expression, use of sfumato technique, and its theft in 1911 have only increased its fame.The Starry Night depicts a swirling night sky over a quiet town, capturing Van Gogh’s emotional turmoil. Painted in 1889 from the window of a mental asylum, it reflects his battle with mental illness. The painting’s vibrant brushstrokes and dreamlike quality make it one of the most iconic artworks ever.Painted between 1495 and 1498, The Last Supper portrays Jesus and his disciples during the moment of betrayal. Located in Milan’s Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, it showcases Da Vinci’s innovative use of perspective and human emotion. Restoration efforts over the centuries have struggled to preserve its original grandeur.Shakuntala depicts the beautiful heroine from Kalidasa’s epic, Abhijñānaśākuntalam. Raja Ravi Varma captures her essence with delicate brushwork, showcasing her deep emotional connection with nature and the divine. The painting conveys a poignant moment of longing, emphasising the themes of love, fate, and the transient nature of beauty.Created in 1931, The Persistence of Memory is known for its melting clocks, symbolising the fluidity of time. Dalí’s surrealist masterpiece explores themes of dreams and the subconscious. Its bizarre yet captivating imagery has made it one of the most recognizable works in modern art history.Often referred to as the ""Mona Lisa of the North,"" Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) features a young girl in a turban with a luminous pearl earring. Painted by Dutch artist Vermeer, its simplicity, use of light, and the subject's gaze evoke intrigue and mystery, capturing timeless beauty.Guernica (1937) is Picasso's powerful anti-war statement, depicting the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. The monochromatic, chaotic composition was inspired by the bombing of the town of Guernica. The painting’s distorted figures and intense emotion make it one of the most famous political artworks of the 20th century.Edvard Munch’s The Scream (1893) embodies human anxiety and existential dread. Inspired by a panic attack the artist experienced, its swirling sky and distorted figure reflect inner turmoil. The painting’s haunting expression and bold colours have cemented it as a symbol of modern emotional experience and psychological depth.In Bharat Mata, Abanindranath Tagore presents India as a goddess, symbolising the nation’s unity and strength.

This painting became a powerful symbol of the Indian independence movement.The Night Watch (1642) is Rembrandt’s grand depiction of a militia company, praised for its dynamic composition and use of light. Once considered a night scene due to dark varnish, later restorations revealed it as a daytime setting. Its scale and intricate details showcase Rembrandt’s mastery of portraiture.Bride’s Toilet portrays the intimate moment of an Indian bride’s preparation, capturing the beauty and vulnerability of the ritual. Painted in 1937, Sher-Gil’s uses rich colours and expressive forms to depict the emotions of anticipation and femininity.American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood depicts a stern farmer and his daughter, set against a rural backdrop. It has become a symbol of American rural life, though its meaning is debated. Some interpret it as a critique of small-town life, while others see it as a celebration of Midwestern values.Painted in the 1480s, The Birth of Venus depicts the Roman goddess Venus emerging from the sea. Botticelli's delicate use of colour and graceful figures evoke beauty and myth. Commissioned by the powerful Medici family, this Renaissance masterpiece has become an enduring symbol of classical beauty and humanism.Horses showcases M.F. Husain’s fascination with these majestic animals, which he often used as metaphors for freedom and energy. The vibrant colours and dynamic brushstrokes convey a sense of movement and vitality. This artwork reflects Husain's modernist approach, blending traditional Indian themes with contemporary artistic expression.Three Pujarins exemplifies Jamini Roy's unique style, blending traditional Indian folk art with modern aesthetics. The painting features three women engaged in ritualistic worship, adorned in vibrant colours and patterns. Roy’s emphasis on simplicity and expressive forms highlights the cultural richness of Indian traditions, celebrating the beauty of everyday life.","From the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa to the haunting Scream by Edvard Munch, each painting reveals deeper meanings.

My Night At P Diddy's Freak Off-Tanea

A former guest at one of P Diddy’s notorious parties has shared shocking details, describing scenes that included little people dressed as Harold Juku dolls, among other unsettling behaviours at the rapper's 'freak off' parties. Speaking toTanea, who attended the party, recounted her experience alleging that upon arrival at the party, security was tight, and attendees were forced to hand over their phones, which were sealed in bubble cases to prevent any unauthorised photos or videos.While walking around the party, Tanea claimed that she was approached by one of P Diddy's sons, who selectively invited certain attendees into the main house, where the more private aspects of the 'Freak Off' took place. They said, “You couldn’t just walk into the house – you had to be chosen.” Those selected were reportedly given a pair of white shoes, signifying that they were permitted access to the house.Once inside, the guest described the atmosphere as chaotic, with loud house music blasting, making it difficult to see or hear clearly. “People were walking around naked, skinny dipping in the pool, drinking mimosas,” she recalled. Waitresses reportedly roamed the venue, passing out drinks to partygoers.However, what stood out most to the guest was the sight of little people dressed up like Harold Juku dolls, complete with red lipstick. “It looked like some sort of fetish,” she said.""I'm looking like, what are they doing here? Like dressed up little red lipstick. Like they weren't supposed to be there, but I'm just looking like maybe it's some type of production going on.""""But why would they be at this party at seven o'clock in the morning with grown people? Why would they be here?"" Tanea questioned.Tanea also noticed the presence of several Instagram models and was approached by P Diddy himself, who engaged them in a conversation. “He started talking about Cuba, asking if I was going to go with them,” she said. The guest also mentioned feeling increasingly uncomfortable as she noticed people around them engaging in explicit activities. “It was like something you see in the movies,” Tanea said.These revelations come at a time when P Diddy, is facing federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The rapper is accused of using his business empire, including Bad Boy Entertainment , to facilitate illegal activities at these infamous 'Freak Off' parties. The trial is set to begin in May 2024, with Combs pleading not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could face a minimum of 15 years in prison.","P Diddy is facing federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges.

Demis Hassabis: Demis Hassabis: The video gamer and knight who became a Nobel Laureate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/demis-hassabis-the-video-gamer-and-knight-who-became-a-nobel-laureate/articleshow/114117951.cms,"Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind Technologies, the AI division behind Gemini, poses for a photo at the Google DeepMind offices in London, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024 after being awarded with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.(AP Photo/Alastair Grant)

Demis Hassabis , Britain’s recent Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, has a remarkable background that bridges the worlds of video games and artificial intelligence . Unlike most teenagers, who typically spend their time playing video games, Hassabis spent his formative years developing them. His big break came in 1994 when he co-designed the hit game Theme Park , a simulation where players manage amusement parks.Born in London to a Greek Cypriot father and a Singaporean mother, Hassabis excelled academically. He earned a double first in computer science from Cambridge University, later launching his own video game company. His intellectual curiosity led him to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience , which became a stepping stone to co-founding the AI startup DeepMind . This venture was eventually acquired by Google for £400 million in 2014.Now 48 years old, Hassabis holds the position of Chief Executive at Google DeepMind, the company’s advanced AI unit. He was knighted in 2023 for his services to artificial intelligence, and his work has culminated in the Nobel Prize, which he shares with colleague John Jumper and US academic David Baker. Their award stems from groundbreaking work in using AI to predict and design the structure of proteins, a significant achievement in both the scientific and AI communities.Hassabis has long emphasised the connection between gaming and artificial intelligence, describing games as an entryway to the world of AI. His early passion for chess, coupled with a fascination for chess computers, sparked ideas about how machines learn, which would later influence his pioneering work in AI. His startup, DeepMind, achieved global recognition by building AI systems that outperformed humans in complex games like Go, chess, and Starcraft II.Beyond gaming and research, Hassabis’s expertise is highly valued by governments and thought leaders. In 2020, he was called upon to provide advice to the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies during the Covid-19 pandemic. His reputation as a forward-thinking AI expert led figures like Dominic Cummings and Tony Blair to seek his counsel on national and global matters.As a leader in Google’s AI research, Hassabis is at the forefront of the global AI race, with major US tech companies such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft competing for breakthroughs. While deeply involved in advancing AI technologies, Hassabis is acutely aware of the risks. In recent years, he has voiced concern over the potential dangers of AI, likening its risks to those of pandemics and nuclear war. In 2023, he signed a statement urging global leaders to treat the threat of uncontrolled AI systems as seriously as they treat other existential challenges, such as climate change.However, Hassabis remains optimistic about AI’s potential for good. The Nobel Prize itself is a testament to this, particularly his work with AlphaFold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures . This development has far-reaching implications for medical research and drug development, showcasing the profound ways in which AI can benefit society.Despite his caution regarding AI's dangers, Hassabis continues to champion its capacity to address complex global problems. His leadership in both AI innovation and ethical considerations ensures that he will remain a key figure in the future of technology.","Demis Hassabis is the CEO of Google's AI division, DeepMind.

"'You're drunk': Britons stunned by BBC app's shocking 18,995 mph wind forecast!",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/youre-drunk-britons-stunned-by-bbc-apps-shocking-18995-mph-wind-forecast/articleshow/114117178.cms,"Britons stunned by BBC app's shocking 18,995 mph wind forecast!

Britons on Thursday were startled by unsettling news when the popular BBC Weather app erroneously predicted winds 150 times more powerful than Hurricane Milton , which was attributed to a data glitch. As television news channels aired footage of Milton pummeling Florida in the United States, the extraordinary wind speeds displayed on the BBC Weather app led many individuals to seek clarification on social media platforms.One X user, posting under the username Larky McRory, shared a screenshot of the app displaying wind speeds of 18,995 mph, accompanied by the comment: ""Go home BBC weather app, you're drunk.It's about 37mph.""Hurricane Milton, classified as a Category 3 hurricane in Florida, had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 kph).BBC Weather attempted to alleviate public concerns by clarifying that the weather conditions were more likely to resemble a typical autumn day with cold air and gusty showers, rather than hurricane-force winds. BBC Scotland Weather posted on X, saying, ""Don't worry folks, there isn't a hurricane on the way today for Scotland, and Edinburgh isn't going to see wind gusts of an impossible magnitude of 17246mph! There is a major error in the data being ingested into the app.""The app displayed a banner announcement acknowledging the issues with the forecast data and assuring users that they were working to resolve the problem. BBC Weather also acknowledged that some temperatures were being displayed incorrectly and apologized for the inconvenience.The glitch evoked memories among some social media users of the incident in 1987 when Michael Fish, Britain's leading weather presenter at the time, assured viewers that reports of an approaching hurricane were inaccurate, mere hours before hurricane-force winds struck the nation.","BBC Weather app erroneously predicted winds 150 times more powerful than Hurricane Milton.

As the region prepares for one of its biggest sporting events this November, Ghani is testing the limits of human endurance to raise funds for children affected by cancer and conflict.On August 8, Ghani Souleymane began a 100-day triathlon journey, completing one full T100-format triathlon every day. The challenge involves a 2km swim, an 80km bike ride, and an 18km run, daily, culminating in a total of 10,000km by the time he crosses the finish line on November 16, the final day of the Dubai T100.Ghani’s effort will amount to:The final day of his 100-day challenge is scheduled to coincide with the Dubai T100’s amateur triathlon, allowing him to complete his last race alongside hundreds of fellow participants, many of whom will be tackling the T100 format for the first time, while Ghani finishes his 100th consecutive triathlon on the same course.This is more than a test of physical ability, it's a bid for a Guinness World Record for the most consecutive T100 triathlons completed.It is also a massive fundraising initiative aimed at supporting vulnerable children, particularly those impacted by cancer and conflict.Originally from Togo and now a prominent figure in Dubai’s fitness community, Ghani Souleymane is a seasoned endurance athlete, running coach, and member of Adidas Runners Dubai. Known for his previous feats, including 30 ultramarathons in 30 days in 2020 and 30 Ironman triathlons in 30 days in 2023, Ghani’s reputation is grounded in pushing the boundaries of endurance for meaningful causes.He is a Dubai Fitness Challenge Hall of Famer and frequently uses his athletic undertakings to raise awareness and support for health and education-based initiatives. His current challenge continues that mission, focusing on healthcare and sports inclusion.This 100-day initiative benefits the Al Jalila Foundation, which is constructing the Hamdan Bin Rashid Cancer Charity Hospital, a 250-bed facility dedicated to cancer care.

UAE: No more power banks on Emirates flights? What to know about new policy starting October 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-no-more-power-banks-on-emirates-flights-what-to-know-about-new-policy-starting-october-1/articleshow/123201693.cms,"Power banks use lithium-ion batteries where ions move between electrodes; overheating or damage can cause thermal runaway, leading to fires/ Image generated using AI for illustrative and creative purposes

TL;DR





Emirates bans all in-flight use of power banks starting October 1, 2025.



Only one power bank under 100Wh is allowed in carry-on, not in checked baggage.



Power banks must be stored under the seat or in the seat pocket—never overhead.



Charging devices from power banks or charging power banks during flight is not allowed.

What the new Emirates policy says

Emirates customers may carry one power bank that is under 100 Watt Hours.

Power banks may not be used to charge any personal devices onboard.

Charging a power bank using the aircraft’s power supply is not permitted.

All power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available.

Power banks may not be placed in the overhead stowage bin onboard the aircraft and must now be placed in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of you.

Power banks are not permitted in checked luggage (existing rule).



Why Emirates is introducing this ban

A response to industry trends and past incidents

What passengers need to know before flying

Pre-charge all devices before arriving at the airport.



Use the aircraft’s in-seat charging points (where available) instead of personal power banks.



Verify the watt-hour rating on your power bank; it must be under 100 Wh and clearly marked.



Store the power bank in the seat pocket or under-seat bag, not in the overhead compartment.

Q. Will Emirates provide alternatives to charge my devices in-flight?





Starting October 1, 2025, Emirates will implement a strict new safety policy prohibiting the use of power banks on all its flights. The measure aims to reduce the fire risks associated with lithium-ion batteries, following industry trends and past onboard incidents. While passengers may still carry a power bank in their carry-on under defined conditions, any usage during the flight, either to charge devices or to be recharged, will be strictly banned.Under the revised guidelines, passengers on Emirates flights will be allowed to carry only one power bank in their hand luggage, subject to specific safety requirements. However, using power banks onboard will no longer be permitted in any form.Here are the full details of the policy:Passengers are advised to keep the power bank within reach, allowing cabin crew to respond quickly in the event of overheating or malfunction.The ban stems from safety assessments and growing global concern over lithium-ion battery hazards, particularly those associated with portable power banks. Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries, the core components of most power banks, are known to carry thermal runaway risks, a phenomenon where a battery’s temperature increases uncontrollably, potentially leading to fire, explosion, or toxic gas release.The underlying mechanism involves lithium ions moving through an electrolyte between two electrodes. If the battery is overcharged, physically damaged, or manufactured without proper safeguards, the electrolyte may overheat. In such cases, the battery may undergo thermal runaway, where heat production outpaces heat dissipation, triggering combustion or explosion.Emirates has stated that the risk is particularly high with low-cost or unregulated power banks, which may lack essential safety controls like temperature regulation or automatic shut-off mechanisms.Emirates is not alone in tightening its policy on portable batteries. Other major carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, EVA Air, China Airlines, and AirAsia, have already implemented restrictions on using power banks in-flight.The move follows high-profile safety incidents, including a January 2023 fire on an Air Busan Airbus A321, believed to be caused by a power bank. The incident left 27 passengers injured and led to renewed aviation-sector calls for stricter battery safety protocols.To ensure compliance and avoid last-minute issues at boarding, Emirates recommends that passengers take the following precautions:Passengers who fail to meet the guidelines risk having their power bank confiscated at the gate or denied boarding in extreme cases, as safety takes precedence.Yes, you can bring one power bank under 100Wh in your carry-on, but it must not be used or charged during the flight.Store it in your seat pocket or under the seat, placing it in overhead bins is not permitted.No, placing power banks in checked baggage is strictly prohibited for safety reasons.Yes, you may use the in-seat charging ports available on many Emirates aircraft, but not your own power bank.","Emirates bans all in-flight use of power banks starting October 1, 2025.

Blood Moon over Bahrain: Here's how to watch and photograph the celestial show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/blood-moon-over-bahrain-heres-how-to-watch-and-photograph-the-celestial-show/articleshow/123157364.cms,"Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025/Image: File

TL;DR:

Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on the evening of Sunday, September 7, 2025, with the eclipse visible from 7:28pm to 10:56pm; peak totality (the ""blood moon"" phase) will last for about 1 hour and 22 minutes.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon, blocking direct sunlight and causing the Moon to turn a deep red as seen from Earth.

The event can be viewed safely with the naked eye or photographed using a camera or phone with some basic techniques, no special equipment required, but a tripod and planning help capture the spectacle clearly.

What is a Lunar Eclipse?

Details of the 2025 total Lunar Eclipse in Bahrain

Date: Sunday, September 7, 2025

Duration: The eclipse lasts about 5 hours and 27 minutes from start to finish, with the total phase (complete coverage) lasting about 1 hour and 22 minutes.

Visibility: The entire eclipse will be visible from Bahrain, with the moon turning deep red at its peak—a rare sight not seen in Bahrain since July 2018 and not expected again until 2028.

Key Timings for Bahrain (local time):

Eclipse begins: 7:28pm.

Totality (blood moon): approx. 7:49pm to 9:11pm.

Maximum eclipse: 9:11pm.

Eclipse ends: 10:56pm.

How to observe and photograph the eclipse

Watching the Eclipse

No special equipment is needed to enjoy a lunar eclipse, view it safely with the naked eye.

For a closer look or enhanced detail, binoculars or a small telescope are helpful.

If skies are clear, find a spot with minimal light pollution for the best view.

How to capture the Lunar Eclipse (Photography tips)

1. For Smartphone Users:

Stabilize: Use a tripod or steady surface; lunar eclipse photos are challenging in low light and any shake will blur the image.

Turn off the flash and consider including landmarks or silhouettes in your frame for context.

Zoom carefully: Use optical zoom if available, digital zoom can reduce image quality.

Night mode: Activate your phone’s night or astrophotography mode if available.

2. For DSLR or Mirrorless Cameras:

Lens: A telephoto lens (300mm or longer) will capture close-up details; a wide-angle lens can show the Moon in the landscape.

Tripod: Essential for keeping the camera still during long exposures.

Camera Settings:

Start with ISO 400 and a wide aperture (f/5.6 or wider). As the Moon darkens during totality, you may need to increase ISO or extend exposure time.

Manual focus set to infinity is recommended.

Use a cable release or self-timer to avoid camera shake.

Bracket your shots: Take multiple exposures at different shutter speeds to capture both the bright and dim phases of the eclipse.

Continuous Shots: You can take a series of images at regular intervals to document the different eclipse stages and create a composite later.

General tips:

Plan your compositions before the eclipse using moonrise and direction forecasts.

Practice your setup a night or two ahead to get comfortable with camera settings in low light.

Charge your batteries and clear your memory card in advance.

Bahrain is set to witness a rare and awe-inspiring celestial event on the evening of September 7, 2025, a total lunar eclipse visible across the Kingdom for over five hours. Marking the nation's first full ""blood moon"" event since 2018, the eclipse will cast the Moon in a deep red hue during its peak, captivating both skywatchers and astrophotographers alike. With full visibility, ideal conditions, and cultural significance tied to Islamic traditions, the eclipse promises a night of science, serenity, and spectacle.A lunar eclipse is an astronomical event that happens when the Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall across the surface of the Moon. This only occurs during a full moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned in a straight line (a configuration known as “syzygy”). When the Earth's central shadow (the umbra) completely covers the Moon, it's called a total lunar eclipse. During totality, sunlight refracted through Earth’s atmosphere bathes the Moon in a coppery-red light, leading to the popular term “blood moon”.Unlike a solar eclipse (which requires eye protection and is visible only from certain locations), a lunar eclipse can be observed with the naked eye from anywhere it’s night and is completely safe to watch.The event also aligns with Salat Al-Khusuf (the eclipse prayer), making it significant for both scientific and cultural reasons.The total lunar eclipse of September 7, 2025, offers Bahrain residents and visitors a rare chance to witness one of nature’s most spectacular celestial events, right from their own backyards. Whether you simply gaze at the Moon or aim to photograph its changing phases, the experience promises to be both inspiring and memorable. Remember to prepare ahead for the best view, check the timing, and enjoy a safe, awe-inspiring night under the “blood moon. ”","Bahrain will experience a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025. Event can be viewed safely with the naked eye or photographed using a camera or phone. No special equipment required, but a tripod and planning help capture spectacle clearly. The entire eclipse will be visible from Bahrain, with the moon turning deep red at its peak.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123159559,imgsize-4082,width-400,resizemode-4/123159559.jpg"
"Should Keir Starmer remove Prince Andrew's titles? New Book lifts lid on York family, rekindles debate over royal position",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/should-keir-starmer-remove-prince-andrews-titles-new-book-lifts-lid-on-york-family-rekindles-debate-over-royal-position/articleshow/123183535.cms,"



The question of whether Prince Andrew should be stripped of his titles has resurfaced ahead of the publication of Andrew Lownie's new biography.The book, entitled The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail following four years of research and hundreds of interviews. Lownie revealed a series of the York family's secrets, ranging from Prince Andrew's unusual sexual habits to Sarah Ferguson's association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.""There is very little that the Royal Family can actually do when it comes to Prince Andrew,"" said Daily Mail's Editor-at-Large Richard Kay on the latest episode of ""Palace Confidential.""""He's been effectively sacked. He's the only royal prince who has been sacked from public life that I can think of. ""Short of sending him far, far away - and who would want him? - I think it's very insulting when I keep reading suggestions of sending him to the Falkland Islands. Do the people there particularly want Prince Andrew? I doubt it very much.""So it's difficult to know what to do with him. He's just going to be there. They have managed it fairly well. He doesn't have any kind of public role. ""What about stripping him of everything? Well, he was born a prince, and he was given a dukedom.""The one thing they could possibly do would be to remove the dukedom, but I think it would have to come through parliament, and I can't see any government of any shade wanting to get involved in anything like this. It would open up a real can of worms.""So far, just six per cent of readers have responded 'no' to the question. Richard stars on the hit YouTube panel show alongside Daily Mail's Diary Editor Richard Eden and Royal Editor Rebecca English.Rebecca, who has covered the royal beat for the Daily Mail since 2004, added: ""It's a hugely tricky one for them because he is there and he exists. They can't airbrush him out - he is a member of their family."" In an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the Daily Mail's royal newsletter, ""Palace Confidential"", Lownie stated he contacted over 3,000 former school contemporaries, staff, colleagues, and associates of the couple. ""Of whom 300 spoke to me,"" Lownie said.""Some on the record, but most off. ""They felt it was time to challenge the York family’s carefully curated narrative. It is difficult because there tends to be a code of silence about the royals (no one wants to be cast out of the privileged circle).""Additionally, their staff have to sign NDAs, royals are not fully subject to the Freedom of Information Act and there are strict limits on what questions MPs can ask about them in Parliament. ""I could also add the letters I received threatening to sue me, before a word of the manuscript had been seen. Charming people.""In the ""Palace Confidential"" episode, Richard Kay pointed out that within the Royal Family, there is an instinct to ""circle the wagons and protect one of their own"".He added: ""Their first response in all these cases is 'Oh, it's just the press, it's the media.' This is different. This is a graphic book written by a figure who has some substance in the writing he has done. ""You can't just brush this away."" Having covered the royal beat for more than 20 years, Richard Eden shared his views on whether Andrew should be stripped of his titles.He said: ""Certainly, what the King could do, and something that I have advocated for a long while, is strip him of his role as a Counsellor of State. ""He and Prince Harry still have the legal right to deputise for the King. That could easily be stripped from them, as well as his title of Duke of York or other things if they wanted to.""He is still in the line of succession. Yes, it would take an Act of Parliament, but that's no big deal. ""The King did it recently when he extended the list of Counsellors of State to include Princess Anne and Prince Edward. It could be done very easily indeed.""That's something which I would strongly suggest he does."" Elsewhere in the episode, the panel discussed the possibility of Prince William taking ""decisive action"" regarding aspects of the monarchy in the coming years.","Andrew Lownie's new biography, The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail.

Mark Sewards, a British MP for Leeds South West and Morley, has launched an AI version of himself that responds to public complaints using his own voice.He introduced the digital assistant, ""AI Mark"", through his official X account. ""This prototype AI model offers my constituents an additional way to engage with their MP on local casework and policy issues.

A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring, squawking its way into an unlikely role in a major narcotics bust, authorities revealed this week.The Lancashire Constabulary filed charges against 15 individuals connected to the gang, which purportedly distributed drugs across Blackpool, England, from February 2023 to July 2024. The operation was orchestrated by 35-year-old Adam Garnett whilst serving a prison sentence, Fox News reported.The case unfolded after prison staff discovered multiple mobile phones and Wi-Fi routers during a search of Garnett's cell. This finding led investigators to his alleged associates, including Dalbir Sandhu, Shannon Hilton and Jason Gerrand.Subsequent home searches revealed heroin, crack cocaine, ketamine, cannabis, substantial cash amounts and mobile phones connected to drug trafficking A notable discovery came from Hilton's phone, containing recordings of her parrot ""Mango"" repeating ""two for 25,"" believed to be drug transaction terminology.Additional footage showed the bird interacting with money allegedly obtained through illegal activities.Video:""What's the most talented thing your pet can do? Sit? Give paw? How about speak?"" Lancashire Police wrote in a post on the department's Facebook page.""One drug dealer's parrot learned to say 'two for 25' - a phrase picked up as part of common language used by the organised crime gang run by her boyfriend. Not a phrase you want your parrot squawking when the police come knocking!""Investigators uncovered video communications between Hilton and Garnett, including footage displaying kilogram-sized cocaine packages, occasionally accompanied by drug-referencing song lyrics.Despite his imprisonment, Garnett reportedly maintained central control, directing evidence concealment efforts and maintaining communication with virtually all network members.Det. Sgt. Anthony Alves of Lancashire Police's West Targeted Crime Team commended the results, describing it as a ""coordinated and complex drug operation that extended far beyond prison walls.""""Garnett continued to run his enterprise while incarcerated, using illegal devices to maintain control. I want to thank my team, our partners at the Crown Prosecution Service, and our prosecution team for their dedication to bringing these criminals to justice.""He noted that warrants remain active for Chloe Stott and Ryan Black, requesting public assistance in locating them.Police reported additional evidence from suspects' devices included videos displaying large cash sums, drug-themed rap lyrics and documented narcotic transactions.Garnett received an additional 19 years and six months imprisonment, consecutive to his existing 15-year sentence. Hilton, 29, received 12 years whilst Sandhu, 41, was given 10 years.The operation formed part of Operation Warrior, Lancashire Police's initiative targeting organised crime, drug trafficking, exploitation and violence. Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw supported the initiative and praised the results.""This sends a clear message: we will not tolerate organized crime in our communities. I remain committed to giving law enforcement the resources they need to take down these gangs and protect the public.""",A chatty parrot with a knack for drug slang has helped British police crack down on a prison drug ring.

Anderson’s calm response

What critics say about Markle’s show

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan. Either way, dinner is served.",Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series.

A British woman has come under fire after having an issue over Marks & Spencer employees at London Heathrow Airport speaking in Hindi. Lucy White, who describes herself as a public policy specialist, shared her incident in a post on X, which quickly went viral and drew widespread criticism. Many accused her of racism and intolerance in a multicultural environment.White wrote that she had just arrived at Terminal 3 of the airport and visited the M&S store, where she overheard three staff members speaking in a language other than English. When she asked them what language they were speaking, the employees told her it was Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India.“I have a voice recording & their names to report to M&S. We must confront them every time,” she added.Her post drew backlash with users online calling her racist and many questioning why she found it offensive and what rules the employees had broken.This incident is not the first time White has faced criticism for similar remarks. A few weeks ago, she posted another tweet targeting Indian and Asian employees at Heathrow, claiming they spoke “not a word of English.” She added that when she asked them to speak English, they called her a “racist.”One user, on her latest post, commented, “Confront people who talk in a different language? No thanks. We should however confront vile bigots like yourself that make this country a much sadder, less friendlier place.”Another user said, “How embarrassing.

Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck to be hit by US Air Force in live missile tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-to-be-hit-by-us-air-force-in-live-missile-tests/articleshow/123201675.cms,"Elon Musk’s Tesla truck heads to the battlefield



From sales floor to missile range





The US Air Force is literally putting Elon Musk ’s Cybertruck in its sights. Two of Tesla’s futuristic, stainless steel electric trucks will be purchased for live-fire missile tests at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. According to NY Post, the military says the vehicle’s unique angular design, stainless steel exoskeleton and advanced 48-volt electrical system make it a valuable stand-in for potential enemy assets in combat simulations. This unusual military interest comes as the Cybertruck, once touted for its near-indestructibility, faces ongoing public scrutiny over its design and a history of high-profile durability controversies.According to Air Force documents, the Cybertruck’s “aggressively angular and futuristic design” combined with its unpainted stainless steel exoskeleton offers a level of resilience unusual in consumer vehicles. Its robust structure reportedly sustains less damage from impacts compared to conventional steel or aluminium bodies. The truck’s 48-volt architecture also provides more power and efficiency, capabilities that could be exploited by adversaries, making it an ideal candidate for weapons testing.The two Cybertrucks, costing about $80,000 each, will be part of a broader $2.64 million contract to acquire 33 vehicles for US Special Operations Command.At White Sands Missile Range, the trucks will undergo missile and ballistic trials designed to mimic real-world battle conditions. Officials believe the data will help refine both offensive and defensive strategies against similarly armoured vehicles. Since its 2019 unveiling, marked by Musk’s failed “unbreakable” window demonstration, the Cybertruck has been promoted as a rugged, combat-ready machine. Tesla has even released footage of the vehicle withstanding gunfire from submachine guns, pistols and shotguns. For the Air Force, however, the focus is not on hype or market performance, but on preparing for a battlefield where vehicles might be as unconventional as Musk’s creation.","Two Tesla trucks will undergo missile and ballistic trials at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Sam Altman on GPT-5’s ‘disappointing’ launch

ChatGPT Plus subscribers switch back to GPT-4o

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that the company’s latest AI model – GPT-5 had a ‘bumpy’ launch. The confession was made during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session on Friday, August 8 where Altman and members of the GPT-5 team answered questions about new features, problems at launch, and the now-famous “chart crime”.During GPT-5’s presentation, a flawed chart sparked jokes online. The chart misrepresented SWE-bench Verified data, exaggerating GPT-5's accuracy (74.9% with thinking, 52.8% without) compared to OpenAI o3 (69.1%) and GPT-4o (30.8%), likely due to swapped or misaligned bars, as noted in OpenAI's own SWE-bench Verified documentation released on August 7, 2025.Altman called it a “mega chart screwup” on X (formerly Twitter), clarifying that the blog post charts were accurate.One of GPT-5’s main features is a real-time router that decides whether to answer quickly or take extra time to “think.” But it failed on launch day, making the model appear “more bumpy,” Sam Altman said.“GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber,” he wrote.“Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query”, Sam Altman told Redditors.After the GPT-5 launch, many users complained, saying GPT-4o worked better for their needs. To this, Sam Altman responded:“We are looking into letting Plus users continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs.”“We are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout,” he added.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that the company’s latest AI model – GPT-5 had a ‘bumpy’ launch.

Junior accountants at PwC will be performing manager-level responsibilities within three years as artificial intelligence takes over routine audit tasks, as per the firm's AI assurance leader. New hires will immediately step into supervisory roles, overseeing AI systems that handle data gathering and processing work traditionally done by entry-level employees.""Three years from now, we will feel like the first years are functioning more like fourth years,"" Jenn Kosar told Business Insider in a recent interview. ""We will look back and say, 'Okay, these young people feel more like the managers of my day.'""The transformation is forcing PwC, one of the ""Big Four"" accounting firms, to completely rethink how it trains junior employees. Rather than teaching new hires to execute basic audit tasks, the company is now focusing on ""back to basics"" training that emphasises fundamental audit principles and critical thinking skills.Entry-level workers are receiving earlier training in professional skepticism, negotiation, and advanced analytical skills—capabilities previously reserved for later career stages. The shift reflects AI's ability to handle repetitive work while freeing human employees for higher-value activities.The AI revolution extends beyond junior roles, with senior positions also facing disruption. Partners and managers must adapt to client requests about fully automating certain business functions, Kosar explained in the Business Insider interview.Traditional hourly billing models are under pressure as clients question paying premium rates for work that AI can complete instantly. Former PwC UK partner Alan Paton previously noted that automation is causing clients to reconsider consultant fees when answers come ""instantaneously from a tool.""Despite concerns about AI replacing jobs and reducing critical thinking, Kosar believes the technology will create better-informed professionals who develop faster.
