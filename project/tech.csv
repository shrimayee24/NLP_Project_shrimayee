The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:





Driven by a youthful population and a mobile-first approach, India is getting sucked big-time into digital junk on social media platforms even as western nations are showing signs of plateauing and even declining in this aspect.A recent analysis by the digital audience insights company GWI reveals that daily time spent on social platforms by adults in developed countries has been on a downward trend since a peak in 2022 even as it is rising in India. By the end of 2024, usage in the west was down by nearly 10% from its high point, the decline most pronounced in Europe, although the jury is still out on the effect of AI, which is now throwing up new content.However, India's story is one of rapid and ongoing growth. With a median age of just 28.8, India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion. The country's users spend an average of 2 hours and 28 minutes per day on social media, notably higher than the U.S. average of 2 hours and 9 minutes per day, and far higher than Europe‚Äôs 1 hour 48 minutes.The divergence in usage trends is also reflected in platform preferences and content consumption.In India, platforms that facilitate a mobile-first, video-heavy, and community-driven experience are the most popular. WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram are major players, with short-form video content like Reels and Shorts dominating engagement.The data suggests that for many in the West, the initial novelty and high engagement of social media are fading. Binge is now cringe. This downward trend is seen most among heaviest historical users: teenagers and people in their twenties.While platforms like TikTok ‚Äì which is banned in India ‚Äì are popular in the U.S., the overall consumption patterns are different, with some reports indicating a shift away from reflexive, time-filling scrolling toward more intentional online activities. In other words, westerners are turning up their nose and nos, while Indians are plunging headlong into brain rot, sucking in social media slop just as they are with junk food and sugary drinks, while social media giants are picking their pockets.In a recent essay, the technology writer Cory Doctorow identified a three-stage life cycle for these platforms in a process he called ""enshittification,"" ‚Äì a predictable pattern of decay as they evolve to prioritize shareholder profit over user value.Stage 1: They are good to their users (Bait). The platform offers a genuinely good service‚Äîoften at a loss‚Äîto attract a massive, locked-in user base. Stage 2: (Switch). Once users are locked in (due to network effects or switching costs), the platform begins shifting the ""surplus"" value away from them and toward its business customers (suppliers, creators, advertisers). Stage 3: (Extraction). Finally, with both users and business customers fully dependent, the platform exploits the business customers, clawing back all remaining value to maximize profit for its shareholders. The platform becomes a ""useless pile of shit,"" filled with ""botshit, crap gadgets,"" and advertising scams.There is now a growing movement towards digital detoxification in the west even as the situation is aggravated by AI ‚Äì illustrated by the America‚Äôs troller-in-chief himself dispensing AI-generated garbage, adding to the copious output of social media sewage. Grassroots Advocacy organizations like the youth-led ""LOG OFF Movement"" are urging people to reject what is being called the ‚Äúattention economy‚Äù amid a push to regulate social media companies, despite the major ones having burrowed their way into Washington DC and now allied with the ruling dispensation.","India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion.

How Dubai police advise you to stay safe

Do not share Emirates ID , bank details, or passwords with unverified parties.

The psychology behind fake job ads: Why victims fall for them

New age of scams: WhatsApp, Telegram, and AI-generated offers

The bigger picture: Why scammers target the UAE





In a recent advisory, Dubai Police have alerted the public about a significant increase in fraudulent advertisements circulating on social media platforms and various websites. These deceptive ads promise lucrative part-time job opportunities, preying on job seekers' aspirations.Authorities have issued a series of advisories across their official channels (including their X account and eCrime platform). Here‚Äôs their safety checklist:Public awareness is now the strongest shield ‚Äî Dubai Police emphasize that every suspicious ad reported helps prevent another person from falling victim.Fraudsters exploit the allure of high-paying part-time jobs to lure individuals into illegal activities. These scams often involve:Such activities not only lead to financial loss but can also entangle victims in criminal offenses, making them liable under the law.Fraudulent part-time job ads don‚Äôt just target the desperate, they prey on ambition, curiosity, and convenience. Scammers know people are looking for side income, especially with promises like ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù or ‚Äúearn AED 5,000 a week.‚ÄùBy dangling unusually high salaries with little effort required, fraudsters create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out. Victims often apply quickly, without verifying, because the deal seems too good to ignore.Dubai Police stress that such schemes are designed to trap ordinary people into illegal tasks, from opening bank accounts to transferring suspicious funds activities that could later be prosecuted as crimes.Unlike old-style email scams, these fraudulent job offers now spread through WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and even AI-generated recruiter profiles. Fake HR executives use stolen company logos, polished contracts, and professional-sounding chats to gain trust. Dubai Police have noted an alarming trend of AI tools being used to mimic real HR managers‚Äô writing style making detection even harder.Fraudsters are increasingly targeting the UAE because of its large expatriate population, strong digital economy, and high job mobility. Many newcomers are eager to find quick part-time income, making them vulnerable to ‚Äúgolden opportunity‚Äù traps.But police also remind residents: every scam stopped keeps the country‚Äôs financial system safe from exploitation. ‚ÄúFighting fraud is not just protecting one person ‚Äî it protects the whole community.""","Dubai Police have issued a series of advisories across their official channels.

Starting 12 October 2025, travellers from the UAE heading to Europe will experience a major change at Schengen Area borders. The European Union ‚Äôs Entry/Exit System (EES) will go live, replacing the traditional manual passport stamping process with a digital border control system that uses biometric data. Designed to enhance security and streamline entry for non-EU visitors, the system applies to millions of third-country nationals, including those travelling from the UAE.Here‚Äôs a complete breakdown of what the EES is, who it affects, how it works, and what UAE residents need to prepare for before their next trip to Europe.The EES introduces automated border checks for non-EU nationals entering or exiting the Schengen Area for short stays. This includes UAE citizens and residents who are visa-exempt or travelling on a Schengen short-stay visa (up to 90 days in any 180-day period).From 12 October 2025, border control officers will digitally register the following data on arrival:This data is stored in a centralised EU database managed by eu-LISA, the European Agency for large-scale IT systems in the fields of freedom, security, and justice.On future trips, travellers won‚Äôt need to repeat the full biometric process.Instead, the system will verify identity using previously stored data and digitally log border crossings.Importantly, manual passport stamping will gradually be phased out, though some locations may continue to stamp passports during the system‚Äôs early rollout phase.The EES only applies to travellers from non-EU countries, meaning it directly affects UAE citizens and residents visiting the Schengen Area for short stays.Airlines operating in the UAE, including Emirates and Air Arabia, have already issued alerts to their passengers about the upcoming changes. Both carriers are advising travellers to allow extra time at border checks, especially during their first visit after the system goes live, as the new process could take longer than usual.The European Union is launching the EES to modernise its border management, increase security, and improve efficiency for both authorities and travellers. The current system ‚Äî manually stamping passports ‚Äî is time-consuming, often inaccurate, and unable to reliably detect overstayers.The EES aims to:The system also supports wider use of automated border control gates and self-service kiosks, making travel more seamless once initial biometric data is captured.This initiative is part of the EU‚Äôs broader Security Union agenda, supporting the goals of the European Agenda on Security and the European Agenda on Migration, particularly around countering terrorism and cross-border crime.The proposal for the EES was initially presented on 6 April 2016 under the Smart Borders Package. After negotiations, it was adopted on 20 November 2017, and came into force on 29 December 2017.The EES collects and stores several pieces of personal and biometric information:All data is stored securely and handled under strict EU data protection laws. Access is limited to:In certain circumstances, data may also be shared with international organisations or third countries under regulated conditions.Each travel record remains valid for three years from the last recorded crossing. If you cross the border again, the clock resets. Renewing your passport will not affect your stored data ‚Äî the system will automatically match your new passport with your existing biometric records through facial recognition.There is no need to register in advance. Your biometric data will be collected on your first entry after the system goes live.Although the EES is intended to replace manual stamps, some countries or border points may still apply physical stamps temporarily during the transition period.There is no insurance requirement under the EES. However, some countries (e.g., France) may ask at kiosks whether travellers have medical coverage. Travel insurance is highly recommended but remains optional.Some EU countries may offer National Facilitation Programmes to speed up border checks for frequent visitors. Eligibility criteria and availability vary by member state.The EES applies across all external borders of the Schengen Area. Travellers from the UAE should expect the new system when visiting any of the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.While the Entry/Exit System (EES) is set to officially launch in October 2025, another significant change is scheduled to follow about a year later: the introduction of ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), often referred to informally as the ‚ÄúEuro visa.‚ÄùETIAS will be a new, mandatory pre-travel authorisation for visa-exempt nationals, including travellers from the UAE and the UK, who plan to travel to any of the 30 designated European countries in the Schengen Area. It is not technically a visa, but it is a compulsory security clearance designed to thoroughly screen travellers before they arrive.The authorisation is:If a traveller gets a new passport, they must apply for a new ETIAS authorisation, even if their previous one was still valid.Once implemented, ETIAS will work in tandem with the EES, further tightening EU border security by vetting travellers in advance and tracking their movements upon arrival and departure.For now, the focus remains on the smooth rollout of the EES, a foundational shift in how Europe manages border entry, aiming to balance security, efficiency, and traveller experience.","From October 2025, the EU‚Äôs EES system will replace manual passport stamping with biometric checks for all non-EU travellers, including UAE citizens.

Dubai taxi fleet electrification: Faster charging for drivers and riders

How this fits Dubai‚Äôs bigger EV plan





Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate - a move aimed at speeding up taxi fleet electrification and cutting transport emissions. The deal was signed at WETEX 2025 and is part of DEWA‚Äôs EV Green Charger program.The first phase will launch two main charging hubs: DTC‚Äôs depot near Dubai International Airport and DTC‚Äôs headquarters in Muhaisnah 4. The stations will include next-generation chargers with capacities up to 360 kW, designed to serve the growing electric taxi fleet and support fast turnaround times for vehicles. The rollout of 208 points will take place over the contract period and aligns with DTC‚Äôs broader fleet transformation plans.Dubai‚Äôs new ultra-fast EV charging stations will officially begin rolling out in late 2025, with the first two major hubs operational near Dubai International Airport (DTC depot) and Muhaisnah 4 (DTC headquarters). The full network of 208 charging points is expected to be gradually completed over the next 12‚Äì18 months, ensuring wider coverage for taxi fleets and public EV users.For drivers, the charging service is designed to be affordable and convenient.DEWA has confirmed that pricing will follow standard EV Green Charger tariffs, with potential special rates for fleet operators like Dubai Taxi Company to support the transition to electric vehicles. Drivers can pay using DEWA‚Äôs mobile app, smart cards, or contactless payment methods at each station, making the process seamless Access is straightforward: taxi operators and individual EV owners can register through the DEWA EV Green Charger portal or app, select the nearest available charger, and start charging immediately once registered. The ultra-fast chargers, with capacities up to 360 kW, can significantly reduce charging times, allowing taxis to return to service in under 30 minutes at high-power stations.This rollout ensures that drivers face minimal downtime, can plan routes efficiently around charging points, and benefit from a growing, reliable EV infrastructure. With careful planning, fleet operators can optimize schedules and reduce operational costs while contributing to Dubai‚Äôs green mobility and carbon reduction goals.DEWA and DTC estimate the initial phase will reduce about 37,939 metric tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ annually; when combined with DTC‚Äôs existing chargers, annual savings could reach around 49,654 tonnes. This contribution supports Dubai‚Äôs Green Mobility Strategy 2030 and the UAE‚Äôs Net Zero 2050 goals. The project is explicitly framed as a climate-action step as much as an infrastructure upgrade.DTC aims to electrify its entire fleet of taxis and limousines by 2040, with the EV fleet expected to surpass 2,500 vehicles by 2030. Ultra-fast chargers (up to 360 kW) will shorten charging windows and improve operational efficiency for drivers, helping taxis return to service faster. This contract complements other private-sector rollouts in Dubai designed to cut charge times to ‚Äúunder 30 minutes‚Äù at many ultra-fast sites. Together, these moves make daily EV operations more practical for commercial fleets and drivers.DEWA‚Äôs EV Green Charger initiative, launched in 2014, already supports 1,500+ charging points across Dubai; the new DTC agreement adds capacity targeted at fleet needs while strengthening the public charging ecosystem. Other recent projects (private and public) aim to install hundreds more ultra-fast points across high-traffic locations, retail hubs, residential clusters and transport nodes over the next 12‚Äì24 months. This layered approach (fleet hubs + public ultra-fast sites) is intended to reduce range anxiety and accelerate EV adoption citywide.DEWA‚ÄìDTC deal is a practical step to electrify Dubai‚Äôs transport layer: it pairs high-power chargers with clear fleet targets and measurable carbon savings. For drivers, fleet operators and residents this means cleaner rides, shorter charging waits and a faster path to a greener city.","Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate.

The video, broadcast in coordination with the Command and Control Center, forms part of the police‚Äôs ongoing efforts to raise awareness about dangerous road behavior.The footage, which shows several cars colliding after one vehicle came to a sudden stop, highlights the grave consequences of not paying full attention while driving. According to the Directorate of Traffic and Security Patrols, many of the vehicles involved were driven by individuals distracted by things other than the road, unable to react in time to the unexpected hazard.Authorities clarified that stopping in the middle of the road is strictly prohibited, regardless of the reason ‚Äî whether due to a tire malfunction, mechanical failure, or otherwise. Drivers are required to exit the roadway safely and head toward the nearest shoulder or designated stopping point to avoid obstructing traffic and endangering lives.If the vehicle cannot be moved, motorists must immediately call 999 to contact the Operations Room, enabling police to deploy support and minimize the risk of further accidents or traffic congestion.Additionally, other road users who encounter vehicles stopped improperly should turn on hazard lights, maintain a safe distance, and stay fully alert to avoid collisions. Police emphasized that even a momentary distraction can have catastrophic consequences, particularly in high-speed zones.The warning comes alongside a reminder about the legal consequences of irresponsible road behavior:Stopping randomly in the middle of the road without valid justification:Obstructing traffic flow:Using a mobile phone or being distracted while driving:Running a red light (motorcyclists and motorists):These penalties reflect the UAE‚Äôs strict commitment to road safety and are designed to prevent accidents that often result in severe injuries or loss of life.The crash footage forms part of Abu Dhabi Police‚Äôs ‚ÄúYour Comment‚Äù initiative, a public safety campaign where real accident clips are posted on social media to highlight the dangers of specific violations.

Direct Dubai-Abu Dhabi bus route linking Al Quoz and MBZ City





Expanding Dubai-Abu Dhabi bus network for improved accessibility



Part of a bigger shift toward seamless mobility





In a move to improve intercity connectivity and expand public transport options, Dubai‚Äôs Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has launched a new direct, non-stop bus service between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Operating in partnership with Capital Express ‚Äî a major transport provider in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain ‚Äî this express service is designed to serve residents in areas of Dubai not previously covered by existing routes to the capital.The new express bus connects Al Quoz Bus Station in Dubai with MBZ City Bus Station in Abu Dhabi, operating non-stop along Sheikh Zayed Road, the main highway linking the two emirates. With no scheduled stops in between, the estimated journey time ranges from 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on real-time traffic conditions. This is slightly faster than traditional intercity buses, which typically take 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes, especially when serving multiple stops along the route.Each journey is priced at Dh25 ($6.80) per person, with payments accepted via cash, contactless bank cards, or nol cards ‚Äî the latter being the city's unified fare payment system. The service runs seven days a week, with buses departing every three hours.Each bus accommodates up to 50 passengers and features bright green livery for easy identification.While the RTA have yet to disclose the specific route number or publish a full timetable, the frequency and non-stop nature mark this as a distinct addition to the intercity network.Until now, intercity buses between Dubai and Abu Dhabi primarily departed from Al Ghubaiba Bus Station (serving Bur Dubai) and Ibn Battuta Bus Station, which caters to commuters from areas like Jebel Ali, JLT, Dubai Marina, and The Palm. The addition of the Al Quoz route offers a new departure point for residents in Umm Suqeim, Al Barsha, and nearby neighborhoods, significantly improving accessibility.This development is part of the RTA‚Äôs broader public transport strategy, which focuses on enhancing connectivity, intermodal integration, and commuter convenience. The authority aims to make public transport a first-choice option by linking buses with other transit modes such as the Dubai Metro, tram, and marine transport.The launch follows similar intercity transport expansions, including a Dubai-Sharjah service introduced in May 2025. That service, known as Route 308, connects Stadium Bus Station in Dubai to Al Jubail Bus Station in Sharjah at a fare of Dh12 per trip. The RTA also recently introduced five new bus routes across Dubai and modified several existing routes to meet growing demand and improve commuting efficiency.According to Adel Shakeri, Director of Planning and Business Development at RTA‚Äôs Public Transport Agency, improving intermodal transport options is vital to encouraging the use of public transit. The goal, he stated, is to offer smoother and more efficient journeys by connecting various transportation modes and routes across the city and beyond.Currently, the RTA operates a fleet of over 250 intercity buses, all of which are equipped with free Wi-Fi, allowing passengers to stay connected, whether for work or leisure, during their commute.Looking ahead, more exciting developments are on the horizon. The long-awaited Etihad Rail passenger service is scheduled to launch in 2026, offering high-speed train travel between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in under an hour. Beyond speed and comfort, Etihad Rail plans to integrate seamlessly with existing metro routes and feeder bus services, enhancing last-mile connectivity and ensuring consistently smooth transfers between the rail network and the cities‚Äô broader public transport systems. While buses remain the most widely budget-friendly transport option between the emirates for now, rail is set to introduce a transformative new dimension of convenience and daily efficiency for modern urban commuters.","Dubai‚Äôs Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has launched a new direct, non-stop bus service between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

No more OTP: UAE bank moves to app-based approvals for all transfers; what customers need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/no-more-otp-uae-bank-moves-to-app-based-approvals-for-all-transfers-what-customers-need-to-know/articleshow/124284283.cms,"Emirates NBD ends OTP codes, makes app approval mandatory for transactions

Emirates NBD app verification rollout plan and timeline



Why UAE banks are abandoning SMS OTPs ‚Äî security and customer experience





How to prepare: enable ENBD X verification and backup options

What customers should watch for and common concerns

Edit





Emirates NBD will replace one-time passwords (OTPs) sent by SMS or email with app-based verification through its ENBD X mobile app, starting a phased rollout on 1 November 2025 and extending to debit/credit card alerts soon after. The move follows a wider Central Bank push to eliminate SMS/email OTPs and shift customers to stronger, in-app authentication.Emirates NBD says it will phase out SMS OTPs and use push-based confirmations within the ENBD X app to approve online transactions and transfers. The initial phase begins 1 November 2025, covering account transfers and low-value alerts (reports say transfers of AED 100 or less will be included first), with debit and credit card transaction alerts to follow as the bank expands the system. The bank and industry sources add that the Central Bank of the UAE has directed banks to fully phase out SMS/email OTPs by March 2026, so this change is part of a regulated, sector-wide transition.SMS and email OTPs have become a prime target for fraud: SIM-swap attacks, SMS-interception and social-engineering schemes have exposed customers‚Äô accounts. App-based authentication (push notifications, biometrics and soft tokens) reduces those risks because approvals happen inside a secured app bound to the customer‚Äôs device, often combined with biometric checks.Regulators and banks say the switch improves security and speeds up transactions while reducing reliance on telecom channels.If you bank with Emirates NBD, take three practical steps now: download or update the latest ENBD X app, register your device and enable in-app push notifications and biometric sign-in; confirm your mobile number and contact details securely with the bank; and learn about fallback options (for example, Emirates NBD‚Äôs Smart Pass/soft-token flows or dedicated bank support lines) if you lose your device or travel abroad. Emirates NBD‚Äôs mobile-banking pages clearly list detailed registration steps and troubleshooting advice for customers who cannot access app authentication.For customers, the change means that SMS codes will no longer arrive during transactions. Instead, a push notification will appear on the Emirates NBD app, requiring approval before the transaction is processed. This applies across the board from peer-to-peer transfers within the UAE to international remittances and online shopping payments linked to bank cards. The bank has urged users to update their mobile banking apps and ensure notifications are enabled before the new process takes full effect. Those who have not activated the app on their devices may face delays or disruptions in accessing banking services.The change aims to make online banking safer and faster across the UAE. If you‚Äôre an Emirates NBD customer, update ENBD X, enable in-app authentication and check official bank messages for the exact dates that affect your card, account transfers or alerts. For anything unclear, contact Emirates NBD support or visit the bank‚Äôs mobile-banking help pages.",Emirates NBD says it will phase out SMS OTPs and use push-based confirmations within the ENBD X app to approve online transactions and transfers. The bank has urged users to update their mobile banking apps and ensure notifications are enabled before the new process takes full effect.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124284559,imgsize-1139750,width-400,resizemode-4/online-banking-change.jpg"

After nearly six months of silence, the Dubai Fountain made its long-awaited return with a newly upgraded showcase that drew thousands to the heart of Downtown. According to local media, by late afternoon, the edges of Burj Lake were packed with visitors families, tourists, and residents, many raising their phones to capture photos and videos. People rushed to secure prime spots along the promenade and boardwalk, eager for the best views as the crowd grew steadily ahead of the 6:30 PM performance.Ahead of the relaunch, the enhanced sound system at Dubai Mall reportedly began playing music across the waterfront. Boats were observed preparing the lake‚Äôs surface for the evening show, contributing to a growing sense of anticipation as the start time neared.The inaugural performance featured ‚ÄúEmsaha Dubai‚Äù by Coral Al Emarat, a four-minute patriotic anthem whose title translates to ‚ÄúThe name is Dubai.‚Äù The song is dedicated to the city‚Äôs leadership, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the late Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, celebrating their vision and steadfast support. This was followed by a second display, choreographed to ‚ÄúTime to Say Goodbye‚Äù by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman , a classic orchestral piece that has become a staple in large-scale musical events.Subsequent shows continued through the evening at 30-minute intervals, including a composition by Grammy-winning artist Christopher Tin, a Mandarin pop song that resonated with visiting tour groups from China, and Adele‚Äôs ‚ÄúSkyfall‚Äù, a crowd favourite from past fountain playlists. The return program was designed to offer a renewed but familiar experience, blending emotional resonance with technical brilliance.According to Khaleej Times, large numbers of spectators stayed on to watch multiple rounds of the show, capturing photos and videos of the returning spectacle. Each performance, though built on the same upgraded systems, varied in music and choreography, adding to the draw for those who stayed to watch more than once.The fountain's return comes after a five-month closure, announced in February by Emaar Properties, to allow for a full-scale overhaul. The goal was not just cosmetic enhancement, but a reengineering of its foundational systems for better durability and performance.These enhancements aim to improve show reliability, reduce maintenance needs, and offer a smoother experience to spectators while preserving the fountain‚Äôs original identity.Originally unveiled on 8 May 2009 during The Dubai Mall‚Äôs grand opening, the Dubai Fountain was designed by WET Design ‚Äî the visionary creators of the iconic Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas. It quickly became the world's largest choreographed (Dancing) fountain, stretching an impressive 275 metres across the manmade Burj Lake and capable of shooting 22,000 gallons of water up to 150 metres in the air. The dazzling project cost approximately AED 800 million (about ‚Çπ1,800 crores at the time).Powered by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, the fountain has consistently mesmerised over 14 million visitors annually, weaving stories through coordinated movement, vivid light, and immersive sound. Music choices over the years have included global names like Adele, Pavarotti, Edith Piaf, Lionel Richie, and popular K-pop group EXO, among many other celebrated artists.During the shutdown, Emaar maintained strong public engagement by installing 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the bustling Dubai Mall promenade, looping archival footage of past shows in sync with Burj Khalifa‚Äôs LED displays ‚Äî preserving a lasting sense of connection to the fountain, even as physical shows temporarily paused.ed.With its return, the Dubai Fountain is now operating on new show timings:","Dubai Fountain made its long-awaited return with a newly upgraded showcase that drew thousands to the heart of Downtown.

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has praised Elon Musk for being ‚Äúsmart and ahead of the curve,‚Äù particularly in the realm of video-trained robotics and AI. However, Cuban remains sceptical about Musk‚Äôs vision of humanoid robots dominating the future. Speaking on the Prof G Markets podcast, Cuban highlighted that while robotics will be crucial for productivity, the future lies in function-first, task-oriented robots rather than human-like machines. He envisions robots capable of performing practical chores efficiently, such as cleaning, sorting laundry, or dusting, without necessarily looking like humans.

He envisions these machines creating an economy ‚Äúten times the size of the current global economy‚Äù and bringing about ‚Äúuniversal high income.‚Äù Musk even joked at a Saudi forum that one Optimus robot performed the ‚ÄúTrump dance,‚Äù highlighting the cultural and technological novelty he anticipates.Cuban emphasised that video-trained AI robotics are a key advantage Musk has in the field.‚ÄúWith robotics, they've got to capture video. That's where Elon is smart and ahead of the curve,‚Äù Cuban said. But he doubts humanoid robots will be the main game-changer, arguing that practical design and function will matter more than human-like appearances.Cuban envisions robots designed to complete tasks autonomously, like cleaning homes or sorting laundry. These machines could resemble spiders or other efficient shapes rather than humans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to know what socks go together, how long to wash, and even check under the bed for dust,‚Äù he explained. The focus is on efficiency and usability, not mimicry.Despite differences on humanoid adoption, both Cuban and Musk agree on AI‚Äôs transformative power.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API ‚Äì the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.‚ÄúThis change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,‚Äù NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. ‚ÄúThis step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,‚Äù said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store‚Äôs brand name or any custom label.‚ÄúThis will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,‚Äù said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, ‚ÄúIt helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.‚ÄùBy standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‚Äòultimate beneficiary name‚Äô The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia‚Äôs new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes.

Meta‚Äôs tracking systems monitor workforce AI engagement across divisions





Meta is intensifying pressure on employees to embrace artificial intelligence tools, joining tech giants Google and Microsoft in making AI adoption a critical component of workplace expectations and performance evaluation.The Facebook parent company has deployed dashboards to track how extensively teams use AI and created a gamified system to boost employee engagement with the technology, Business Insider reported. Expectations vary across departments, with some staff encouraged to experiment while others face specific adoption targets that could influence their standing within the company.Meta's hardware division Reality Labs has set an ambitious goal of achieving over 75% AI adoption among employees, up from the current 70% utilisation rate, according to sources familiar with the matter. This represents a dramatic increase from just 30% in June, signalling the company's aggressive push toward AI integration across all operations.The move aligns Meta with industry peers implementing similar mandates. Microsoft's Julia Liuson instructed managers in June to incorporate AI usage into performance evaluations, treating it as essential as collaboration skills. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told employees they must ""be more AI-savvy"" to remain competitive, with the company now generating over 30% of its code using AI tools.Meta employees use AI assistants for code generation, brainstorming sessions, policy inquiries, and document drafting, current workers told Business Insider. The company launched ""Level Up,"" a voluntary program that gamifies AI adoption through its internal chatbot Metamate, rewarding employees with badges as they reach usage milestones.CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly emphasised internal AI adoption, predicting that by late 2025, Meta would have AI performing at a mid-level engineer's standard. On the company's April earnings call, he projected AI coding agents would handle substantial research and development work by mid-2026.Worker-tracking software providers report soaring demand for AI usage monitoring over the past two years as companies seek to measure productivity gains and cost savings from AI investments.A Meta spokesperson confirmed AI adoption is a company priority, stating it focuses on using AI to assist employees with daily tasks. The message across Silicon Valley remains clear: embrace AI-enhanced workflows or risk career stagnation in an industry rapidly reshaping itself around artificial intelligence capabilities.","Facebook parent company Meta has created a gamified system to boost employee engagement with the technology.

Apple removes ICEBlock following Trump administration's pressure







A day after Apple removed the app ICEBlock from its iOS App Store, Google has taken down a similar app, Red Dot, from the Play Store, a report has said. Google confirmed the removal of Red Dot, explaining that its decision was based on a policy against apps presenting ‚Äòa high risk of abuse‚Äô. Both apps have been designed to allow users to anonymously report sightings of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and view nearby alerts. It has been argued that such tools could potentially endanger law enforcement officers.According to a report by 404 Media, Google said it did not receive any outreach from the Department of Justice about the issue.Following a recent act of violence at the ICE facility, Google removed applications saying that it removes apps that facilitate sharing the location of ‚Äòvulnerable groups‚Äô. While Google noted that ICEBlock was never available on the Play Store, the company confirmed that its moderation standards apply broadly to any app that handles user-generated content.‚ÄúICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies,‚Äù Google added.Apple removed the popular application ICEBlock and several similar apps from its App Store ‚Äì triggering debate over technology, government oversight and civil liberties.ICEBlock ‚Äì just like Red Dot ‚Äì had been used by hundreds of thousands of people, allowing individuals to anonymously report and view the locations of nearby ICE agents within a five-mile radius.The removal follows mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which reportedly threatened legal action against both the app‚Äôs creators and media outlets reporting on the tool. Apple confirmed it removed the apps after receiving contact from ""law enforcement,"" though it did not specify which agency or agencies were involved.By providing real-time alerts on ICE agent locations, ICEBlock quickly became a focal point in the national discussion concerning immigration enforcement, privacy rights, and free speech protections. While critics argued that the app could endanger federal agents, supporters defended it as an essential tool for community awareness and protection.","Apple removes ICEBlock following Trump administration's pressure.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes artificial intelligence will soon be smarter than humans in many sectors and is ready to hand over his job to an AI model when the time comes. In a recent interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias D√∂pfner, Altman said he is enthusiastic about the day an AI model can serve as a better CEO of OpenAI than he can. ""I think there will come a time when AI can be a much better CEO of OpenAI than me, and I will be nothing but enthusiastic the day that happens,"" he told in the interview.Altman, who has a front-row seat to the latest AI developments, noted that while AI will destroy many jobs in the short term, new roles will emerge over time. He predicts these new jobs will focus on helping and caring for others, a uniquely human trait. ""In the short term, AI will destroy a lot of jobs. In the long term, like every other technological revolution, I assume we will figure out completely new things to do,"" he said. Those jobs, he said, are likely going to revolve around helping others.Altman told WELT editor-in-chief Jan Philipp Burgard that he would be ""very surprised"" if, by 2030, the world doesn't have ""extraordinarily capable models that do things that we ourselves cannot do."" He added that he expects a ""similar rate of progress"" in 2026 as what was seen in 2024 and 2025.Altman, who used to spend more time on his farm driving tractors and picking crops before ChatGPT's rise, said he looks forward to returning to that life.In addition to his farm, he owns multimillion-dollar properties in San Francisco, Napa, and Hawaii.Altman believes that humans' unique value isn't their intellectual capacity but their ability to care for one another.

‚ÄúThe videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement.‚Äù

""I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed,""

""They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise. I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that,‚Äù

‚ÄúMany times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game. You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for,‚Äù





TikTok has helped a recent software engineering graduate get a job at Amazon . 22-year-old Andrew Chen has claimed that he used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview. Chen, who had just weeks remaining before earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego, used the public documentation as a tool to maintain focus and accountability. Due to the 10-day deadline, Chen created a study plan that included coding practice on LeetCode, behavioural interview preparation, and studying Amazon's Leadership Principles. He searched platforms like Reddit and Blind for insights into Amazon‚Äôs interview process and memorised personal stories in the STAR format to illustrate his values.In May, Chen started posting his preparation updates on TikTok, with the caption,He saw public sharing as a way to keep himself accountable while also opening the door to advice from people who had already faced similar interviews.Chen‚Äôs videos, which gained up to 2.6 million views, sparked mixed reactions, with some doubting his chances due to limited preparation time.In a statement to Business Insider, Chen said:He described Amazon‚Äôs ""loop"" interview as three consecutive virtual rounds: one on technical questions, one on behavioural scenarios linked to leadership principles, and one combining both.he said.In June, after completing other interviews, Chen received a six-figure offer from Amazon. He shared the news on TikTok, gaining over 941,000 views. After graduating in mid-June, he moved to New York City and began working in July. His key takeaway was Amazon‚Äôs strong focus on behavioural questions linked to its leadership principles, which he felt suited him well.Chen noted.He also shared some advice for job seekers, which is that while quality applications are essential, applying in high volume is crucial in a competitive market.Chen added.","Andrew Chen, 22, used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview.
