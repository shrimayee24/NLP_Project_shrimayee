Checking social media: Scrolling through social media feeds before bed can be highly stimulating, making it difficult for your brain to wind down. The constant influx of information, images, and updates keeps your mind active, delaying the natural process of falling asleep. Instead of relaxing, you might find yourself becoming more alert and engaged, which can lead to difficulties in falling asleep and a reduction in sleep quality.

Responding to work emails: Bringing work into your bedroom can blur the lines between professional and personal life. Responding to work emails before bed can increase stress and anxiety, making it harder to relax. This habit can also extend your work hours, leading to burnout and reducing the amount of time you have to unwind and recharge.

Engaging in intense conversations: Whether it's a heated argument or an intense discussion, engaging in emotionally charged conversations via text or messaging apps can elevate stress levels and trigger an adrenaline response. This can make it challenging for your body to transition into a restful state, thus delaying sleep onset and disrupting your sleep cycle.

Watching videos or streaming shows: While it might be tempting to watch videos or stream shows in bed, this habit can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. The blue light emitted by screens can suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Additionally, the engaging content can keep your brain active and prevent you from feeling sleepy.

Playing mobile games: Playing mobile games before bed can be highly stimulating, both mentally and visually. The excitement and engagement required in gaming can increase adrenaline levels and make it difficult for your mind to calm down. This can lead to prolonged sleep latency and decrease the overall quality of your sleep.

Using your phone as an alarm clock: While using your phone as an alarm clock is convenient, it can also tempt you to use it for other activities right before bed. Checking the time or setting alarms can lead to distractions and prolong the time you spend on your device. Consider using a traditional alarm clock to avoid this temptation and keep your phone out of reach during bedtime.

Browsing the internet: Endlessly browsing the internet before bed can keep your mind engaged and delay sleep. The vast amount of information available can lead to information overload, making it harder for your brain to shut down. This habit can also disrupt your sleep schedule, as you might lose track of time and stay awake longer than intended.

Tips for better bedtime habits

Establish a digital curfew : Set a specific time to put away your phone, ideally an hour before bed.

Turning off iPhone to become easier with this new button in iOS 18,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/turning-of-iphone-will-become-easier-with-this-new-ios-18-button/articleshow/110976273.cms,"Apple iOS 18 comes with a dedicated

Apple at times makes things a little more complicated than usual. And turning off the iPhone is one of them. Ever since Apple removed the Home button, the process of turning off an iPhone has become so complicated that at times people tend to forget how to actually turn it off. However, with iOS 18 , things are about to become easier and simpler.Earlier pressing and holding the power button was used to bring up the power off slider on the home screen. Swiping it left to right is used to turn off the iPhone. However, Apple changed that and pressing and holding the power button, on modern iPhones involves Siri and to turn off the iPhone users have to press and hold both the side button and a volume button to turn of the device.With iOS 18, Apple has added a dedicated virtual power button in the Control Centre which is now updated with new customisation options that are now a part of the entire Apple iOS and iPadOS ecosystem.The addition of the dedicated virtual power button which is placed at the top-right corner. Tapping on the power button brings up the turn-off slider – sort of old-school-like. Sliding it left to right turn off the iPhone.Press that button, and the standard power slider will appear on the screen so you can turn off your iPhone.In iOS 18, accessing the Control Center remains unchanged: simply swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen. New to this version, however, is the addition of a power button located in the same corner. This update aims to resolve the power control confusion that has persisted since the iPhone X eliminated the Home button seven years ago, offering a more intuitive solution for users.",Apple iOS 18 comes with a dedicated virtual power button in the Control Centre.

How enterprises can get the best out of AI solutions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-enterprises-can-get-the-best-out-of-ai-solutions/articleshow/110981628.cms,"Some hedge funds and PE/VC firms are making algorithms sit in the boardrooms, taking decisions on behalf of the board, or along with the board, says Sameer Dhanrajani, founder of consultancy AIQRATE and networking platform 3AI. That, he says, is thanks to AI machines crunching decades of data.But getting there, he says, requires a lot of effort, and will be a long-drawn one. A marathon, he calls it.Given the excitement surrounding AI, enterprises are seen to be either stunned by its advance and unable to decide what direction to take, or rushing into it and making investments that are not delivering the results they expect. What’s the best way forward? That was what we discussed the other day in a panel that included Sameer, Gaurav Makkar, engineering director at NetApp, and Prinkan Pal, founder of gen AI-powered analytics platform LegoAI.Prinkan says it’s absolutely critical for enterprises to start off with developing an AI strategy that is unique to it. He says organisations must understand the specific business areas they need AI to provide insights and predictions in, and then go about collecting and organising the data required, and building the models. “The business requirement needs to get translated into something we call as analytical requirement, which then gets translated into an analytical solution. And then it gets translated into a final business solution, which is that automated solution that can be consumed by a non-technical business user,” he says.Data is at the root of this. Gaurav notes digital transformation of operations is the first step towards collecting data. And once that data is collected, it needs to be organised in a way that analytical tools can be applied to it. Organising that data itself can be a humongous task. Data is of different kinds, including text, video, image. Each piece of data contains other information. A video, Gaurav says, is the core data. But then there is the metadata that describes things like where the video was taken, its level of resolution. And then there’s telemetry data – how long did a user play that video, did they press forward on that video, did they return to the video some days later.“Different organisations play with each of these classes of data differently. A person in the sales organisation may be interested in how interactive the content is. Someone else may be keen to cache videos that are used more frequently. Someone may find the metadata showing people are playing on low-resolution devices, in which case there’s no reason to create a 4k video,” Gaurav says.To make such decisions, you need to annotate the data, and today there are auto-annotating tools that are available that can analyse the content and understand what it is. “And then you link the data up, and the more you link up data, it becomes a source of intelligence,” Gaurav says.In the enterprise context, Prinkan says, another element that needs a lot of thinking through is around security, compliance, and governance. Gaurav too underscores that. “Data can have privacy sensitive information. Should I be sending this data outside a certain domain? Who should handle this data? Ethics comes in,” he says.Getting people in an organisation to adopt a solution too can be challenging, because of scepticism or fear of job loss. “Which is where I think human and AI intelligence have to work together to give desired results. Just producing glamorous AI systems will not work,” Sameer says.","Some hedge funds and PE/VC firms are making algorithms sit in the boardrooms, taking decisions on behalf of the board, says Sameer Dhanrajani, founder of consultancy AIQRATE and networking platform 3AI.

As per a report in South China Morning Post, the woman, who is nine months pregnant, shared on X that she had cooked and frozen the dinners in advance, as she planned to stay with her parents for post-partum recovery after giving birth on May 21.

The majority of social media users have criticized the husband for his apparent inability to perform basic household tasks like cooking , with some accusing the wife of coddling him and treating him like a child.

One user questioned, ""What kind of husband allows his heavily pregnant wife to prepare a month's worth of dinners? Does he usually do nothing at home? Isn't it just spoiling him?"" Another commented, ""How pitiful she is – she's been pregnant for nine months and has a vegetative husband.""

The wife defended her actions, stating that her husband often returns home late from work and that he had been supportive and understanding throughout her pregnancy. Some users pointed out that such behavior from wives contributes to a culture that fosters immature and domestically incapable men. However, not everyone viewed the situation negatively, with some appreciating the woman for being a loving and caring wife.

Several individuals also highlighted the widespread nature of this problem, particularly in Asian nations, where countless men, similar to the woman's spouse, lack the skills or inclination to prepare meals for themselves.

A person from China commented, ""Isn't it the same in all East Asian countries? When my mum came to stay with me abroad to help with the baby, she forgot to prepare meals for my dad. He survived on steamed buns and noodles for three months, even losing muscle mass.""

Karnataka murder: How engineer-turned-cop checkmated reel hero,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-murder-how-engineer-turned-cop-checkmated-reel-hero/articleshow/110982273.cms,"Unravelling mystery

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested, the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda, the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element.Girish, joined by Chandan, started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.",Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested on charges of murder.

Snowflake’s taking AI to where data resides: CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/snowflakes-taking-ai-to-where-data-resides-ceo/articleshow/110955730.cms,"It has been about four years since Snowflake entered the Indian market. How has the journey been so far?

How has the rise of GenAI impacted cloud-based data storage and analytics service businesses?

You have just announced Snowflake Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search…

Where else do you see Gen AI having an impact?

You say that Snowflake LLM Arctic with its mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture allows AI models to be built faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. How does it do this?

How do you see the adoption of Gen AI-based products in enterprises?

SAN FRANCISCO: “We receive five billion queries on our Data Cloud every day,” says Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of Snowflake, the cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions. The number is significant, considering Google receives an average of 8.5 billion search requests every day. Ramaswamy was speaking at the firm’s ‘Snowflake Summit 2024’ in San Francisco earlier this week, where the company announced a slew of new technologies that “take AI to where data resides”. The company also announced a tie up with Nvidia that will allow Snowflake customers and partners to build AI-powered applications. Ramaswamy, an IIT Madras alumnus who was in Google for over 15 years and who was appointed CEO of Snowflake in Feb, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the summit. Excerpts:Snowflake operates in two buckets in India. One is with India-based customers like Swiggy, Urban Company, and Piramal Capital, so they can unlock the full value of their data. The second pertains to the trend of American companies moving their core infrastructure to India. We are investing heavily in having a presence in India, in training more people on Snowflake. Companies like Morgan Stanley, for example, have their very senior staff in India taking care of data operations using Snowflake. We have close to 500 people in our Pune centre of excellence, and a lot more expansion is to come.Generative AI is going to have an impact from bottom to top in the stack. For example, there’s a Snowflake feature that transcribes videos, and after indexing the text, you can create a chatbot based on it. And the thing that people are most excited about is that instead of getting a bunch of links, you get answers. We also help them get grounded, cited answers, so that they know where the answers are coming from. Our value prop at Snowflake is to create a single unified product, where things like AI are tightly integrated, and we see ourselves as more an AI Data Cloud.Cortex Analyst is a bit of a North Star for the business analytics area — it will let a business user talk to their data and get answers back. If a business user asks an unreasonable question, the product will say ‘no’. As soon as you give people a chatbot, they start asking ridiculous things like ‘what is my revenue going to be 15 years from now’. A piece of SQL is certainly not going to give you that information. I generally see AI as an enhancer for data access and visualisation. Cortex Analyst is all about asking natural language questions of structured data. Cortex Search is about getting documents indexed so that you can create a chatbot very easily.In cleaning data, for instance. Data has always been messy. There’s no magic wand making sure that you have clean data. For example, think about all the documents that you have consumed. Whenever you search, for example, you are going to run into outdated documents. Making sure that these are marked as outdated or updated will be an ongoing event. We see language models helping with several of these problems. Companies currently spend millions of dollars every year just on data engineering – for cleaning up data, and getting it into a good place.Just like standard AI models, MoE is a stack of parameters, one on top of each other. There are often 24 to 32 layers of neurons that are different kinds of behaviour and connections. In dense models like GPT-3, when a new token (unit of input like a word, an image, etc) comes in for training, it ends up affecting every parameter (GPT-3 has approximately 175 billion parameters) at every layer. For instance, you take a sentence, mask a word in it, and ask the model to predict the word by feeding this sentence in. In the process, every token ends up affecting all parameters and this just makes it computationally expensive to update the model to train on a large amount of data. With MoE, you do an arbitrary subdivision of the token space and, during training, you will have portions of the neural network that get activated for different buckets of tokens (instead of having to impact all the parameters). So, you end up constructing models that are a combination of dense networks that are activated for every token, and sparse experts that are activated only partially. Now, this process can end up producing models that are almost as good as the dense models, but for a smaller amount of compute. And, you can train models faster and more efficiently.Canva, Zoom and Bayer and many others are harnessing Cortex AI to create applications and drive productivity. We have several hundred others building applications to talk to their enterprise data with natural language for business-critical decision making.","Sridhar Ramaswamy is CEO of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform that provides data storage, processing, and analytics solutions.

How to get your CIBIL Credit score without a PAN Card

Factors affecting your CIBIL score

CIBIL credit score : Understanding your creditworthiness is pivotal in today's financial landscape, especially when seeking loans or credit cards. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans. Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3. Provide your date of birth, PIN code, and select your state. Finally, enter your mobile number and click on ‘Accept and Continue’.4. Authenticate your identity by entering the OTP (One-Time Password) delivered to your mobile device on the next screen. Click 'Continue' to proceed.5.

Upon successful registration, you will see a page confirming that 'You have successfully registered!'7. Click on ‘Go to Dashboard’ to access and view your CIBIL score.The factors influencing the new CIBIL score, as stated on the CIBIL website, include:1. Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Limit management



New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme . This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy . Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

AI is not just a computer science subject anymore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ai-is-not-just-a-computer-science-subject-anymore/articleshow/110980982.cms,"WHAT TO STUDY

AI should not be considered just a computer science subject anymore, instead it should be taught to students and professionals in every field, says Arnab Bhattacharya, professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Kanpur.Arnab, who did his PhD in computer science from the University of California in Santa Barbara, says Gen AI is everywhere now and that all educational fields must change in response to it.“Just like we teach Programming 101 to everybody, AI 101 should be taught to everybody. Everyone need not know the mathematical details, but what AI can and cannot do should be known by everyone now. It is very, very important.”Arnab points out that AI is already being used extensively in most engineering fields, and engineers in crucial fields like civil, mechanical, and chemical engineering need to understand that using AI systems that are black boxes can have serious consequences.“What’s going on inside the AI system? What is the integrity of the data? How much bias is there? Can you believe the output? How much can you believe? How much is explainable? These are the things that a person who is applying AI, or influencing some policy on AI, should know.” He says there’s no threat of job losses from AI in the immediate future, because right now the world is riding the rising wave of AI. “But once it stabilises and saturates, then AI will take over more and more jobs, even skilled jobs,” he says.However, this period of flux that AI is ushering in will also elevate certain job profiles and skills, and create many that didn’t exist previously. “Take for example data. AI is very much data dependent. So, understanding the domain of data is extremely important. If you want to understand data, if you want to know which features to look at, which features to engineer, which features to avoid, what is going on in the data, all of that requires deep domain knowledge, that is a skill that needs to be developed,” he says.Computer science students looking to specialise in AI, Arnab says, should do it deeply. “When I say deeply, I mean both in terms of the technical aspects – like what goes on inside neural networks, how to program them, what exactly fine-tuning means, what a tokenizer is exactly supposed to do, etc – and also the social science part of it.”The social science part includes areas like AI bias, AI ethics, fairness, etc, all of which are expected to have an outsized effect on the field.General computer science students, Arnab says, need not focus on the technical aspects of AI but should still not ignore the social science aspects of it. “They need to know how AI can affect things.” They should also focus, he says, on being proficient in programming languages and ensuring mediocrity is kept at bay, because that leaves them susceptible to being replaced by AI.","AI should not be considered just a computer science subject anymore, says Arnab Bhattacharya, professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Kanpur.

"Apple, Google agreed to ‘defend’ search deal from regulators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-google-agreed-to-defend-search-deal-from-regulators/articleshow/103974460.cms,"Apple Inc.’s lucrative agreement to use Alphabet Inc.’s Google as the default search engine for the iPhone includes a provision that the two tech giants will “support and defend” the deal against government scrutiny, a top Apple executive said at an antitrust trial.Their longtime contract was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue disclosed Tuesday in a Washington federal court, where the US government is pressing its claim that Google operates a monopoly in the search business.Cue, the architect of the most recent version of the agreement, said the provision for a joint defense was added at Google’s request. He said it was handled by company lawyers so he couldn’t speak directly to why it was included. Around that time, the European Union was investigating Google’s dominance in online search.During his testimony, the executive defended Apple’s arrangement with its tech rival, saying it was the best choice for customers to have Google as the default search engine.“There certainly wasn’t a valid alternative we would have gone to at the time,” Cue said. “I don’t know what we would have done” if the deal had collapsed, he said.Google first became the default option in the Safari browser in 2002. That deal has been revised several times. Cue said the contract was extended in 2021, after the Justice Department filed its initial case against Google’s search dominance the year before.Google pays Apple billions of dollars for this prominent position on products like the iPhone, making the agreement of particular interest to the government. The question before the judge in the antitrust trial is whether the search giant pushed its way onto Apple devices at the expense of competitors.In his testimony, Cue stressed that Apple sees no need to develop its own search tool because Google clearly is the best option. That differs from the company’s approach in other areas: It competes with Google in mapping software and voice assistants, as well as operating systems for phones and computers.The Justice Department displayed an email from 2016 in which Cue told Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was not agreeing to Apple’s proposed revenue share. When the Justice Department’s attorney asked Cue whether Apple would have walked away from the negotiation, Cue said he didn’t seriously consider it, but Apple might have created its own search engine.Part of Cue’s testimony Tuesday was closed to the public because it involved internal company information that Apple and Google want to keep secret.Cue was expected to testify behind closed doors about Apple’s search arrangements with other companies, which provide the non-default options built into the Safari internet browser, according to a person familiar with the planned testimony. That includes Microsoft Corp.’s Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. Similar to its agreement with Google, Apple gets a slice of the advertising revenue generated when users select those search engines as their main option in Safari.Last week, Apple machine learning chief John Giannandrea testified as well. The executive, who led search at Google before joining Apple in 2018, pointed to a new feature in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 — the latest software that runs iPhones and iPads — that lets users assign a different default search engine for private browsing.That means Apple users can switch between Google and another option more easily, according to Cue. “We like our products to come out of the box and work where it feels like magic,” he said. However, Apple doesn’t track how many customers actually make the change to a non-Google search engine, because of privacy concerns, Cue said.The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.",Apple’s longtime contract with Google was renegotiated in 2016 to include the provision.

How MLow improve audio quality during WhatsApp calls

WhatsApp has announced multiple updates in audio and video calling across all platforms. It said that the users of the instant messaging app can now share audio while screen sharing. The app’s parent company also talked about Meta Low Bitrate ( MLow ) codec to improve call quality.MLow codec offers two-times-better quality with computational complexity than Opus – the open source codec Meta deployed across its instant calling products like Instagram and Messenger .“We are proud to announce Meta Low Bitrate audio codec, aka MLow, which achieves two-times-better quality than Opus. Even more importantly, we are able to achieve this great quality while keeping MLow’s computational complexity 10 percent lower than that of Opus,” the company said.The company said it first deployed MLow to all Instagram and Messenger calls and are now rolling it out on WhatsApp. Meta claimed that it has “already seen incredible improvement in user engagement driven by better audio quality.”Meta shared multiple examples in the form of short audio clips offering a difference between the audio quality. They can be accessed here and the company recommends using a pair of headphones.The technology first divides the raw audio into low and high-frequency bands for separate encoding, which utilises shared information between the bands for improved compression.First, the individual bands are encoded, and then a range encoder further compresses the data for transmission. The decoder then reverses the process to recreate the audio signal from the compressed payload.“MLow has greatly enhanced audio quality on low-end devices while still ensuring calls are end-to-end encrypted. We are really excited about what we have accomplished in just the last two years—from developing a new codec to successfully shipping it to billions of users around the globe,” the company said, adding that it will continue to improve audio quality during calls.",WhatsApp has announced multiple updates in audio and video calling across all platforms.

How iOS 18 may solve one of the 'biggest problem' that users have with social media apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ios-18-may-solve-one-of-the-biggest-problem-that-users-have-with-social-media-apps/articleshow/110974583.cms,"What is changing

How its will work

Apple 's upcoming iOS 18 update will introduce stricter controls on how apps access user contact information . The move essentially targets social networking apps that often request contact access to connect users with friends or suggest who to follow.Currently, social media apps receive the permission to access all or no contacts via a single prompt. If tapped 'allow', the apps get a broad access to the entire contact list. iOS 18 changes this with a two-step permission process revealed during the recently-held Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference.""Control how you share contacts with apps,"" the pop-up will read.""Decide which contacts to share with an app, rather than giving it access to all your contacts. Or give the app access only to those you message and call most,"" it adds.In the first prompt, users will encounter a familiar prompt to allow or deny access to their entire contact list. If the permission is granted, a second prompt emerges, allowing users to choose to share specific contacts with the app, rather than the entire list. If the access is denied, the second pop-up won't emerge.According to Apple, this change is to curb the access provided to future contacts. Once granted permission, the social media apps can access not only existing contacts but also any new ones added over time. The two-stage process aims to give users more granular control over which contacts are shared with specific apps.It's worth noting that some app developers have misused the existing single-permission system. They may have blocked users who declined contact access from using the app entirely. While iOS 18 doesn't directly address this practice, the increased user control over contact sharing may indirectly impact such app behaviour.","Apple's upcoming iOS 18 update will introduce stricter controls on how apps access user contact information. The move essentially targets social networking apps that often request contact access to connect users with friends or suggest who to follow.Currently, social media apps receive the permission to access all or no contacts via a single prompt. iOS 18 changes this with a two-step permission process.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110974561,imgsize-15700,width-400,resizemode-4/110974561.jpg"

During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs. While staying comfortable during hot weather is essential, it doesn't have to come at the cost of soaring electricity bills. By implementing strategic energy-saving practices, you can reduce your summer electricity expenses without sacrificing comfort.Here you can explore several effective ways to save on summer electricity bills, offering practical tips and strategies that can help you minimise energy consumption and lower your utility costs during the warmer months. From optimising your cooling system to adopting energy-efficient habits, these recommendations are designed to make a noticeable impact on your electricity expenses while keeping your home cool and comfortable.Let's delve into these actionable tips that can help you save money and energy throughout the summer season.The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) issues BEE Star Labels as a voluntary method for manufacturers to indicate an appliance's energy efficiency. The label uses stars to indicate the efficiency of a product, with more stars indicating higher efficiency. Simply put, the higher the energy efficiency rating of the appliance, the lower its energy consumption. To effectively reduce your home's energy costs, opt for appliances with a 5-star BEE rating. Not only does this positively impact the environment, but it also helps lower your electricity bills. Explore Crompton's wide range of 5-star rated ceiling fans to learn more about BEE Rating Appliances.If your home still uses CFLs and incandescent bulbs, it's time to replace them with LED bulbs. LED bulbs are not just a trendy choice; they are recognized for their energy efficiency and superior illumination. If you're wondering how to reduce your electricity bill at home, switching to LED bulbs is the solution for you.Upgrading to smart appliances is a highly effective method to decrease electricity consumption at home. These devices allow you to automate tasks and manage energy usage efficiently. Consider installing energy-efficient ceiling fans to further reduce electricity consumption. Smart appliances typically come equipped with remote control capabilities, allowing you to schedule operations and conserve power. Crompton offers remote-controlled fans designed for enhanced energy savings and lower power consumption.These energy-efficient fans are gaining popularity due to their brushless direct current motors (BLDC), which operate on direct current electricity. They can help save up to 60% on electricity compared to normal induction motor-based fans. Additionally, they offer convenient features like remote control for turning the fan on and off, timer functionality, and compatibility with voice assistants. To learn more about the differences between BLDC fans and normal fans and how they can help reduce electricity bills, explore further information on BLDC fans versus conventional fans.Implementing a full solar power system for your home can be a substantial investment. However, there are more accessible and cost-effective ways to leverage solar energy. Installing outdoor solar lights in your balcony and garden, along with solar fans, can notably reduce your energy expenses at a modest cost. Additionally, using solar pumps for daily tasks can contribute to electricity savings. It's beneficial to understand the distinction between an electric geyser and a solar geyser to make an informed choice for your energy needs.Maintain your air conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius to optimise cooling and conserve energy during the summer months, effectively lowering electricity costs. Additionally, using a timer to automate AC operation and upgrading to a 5-star BEE-rated model can further enhance energy efficiency and reduce expenses associated with cooling your space.Numerous advanced smart energy metres are currently offered in the market. These metres typically use Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor overall power usage within a home and provide real-time analysis of consumption patterns. Additionally, they can detect power leaks and identify high-energy-consuming appliances. Wi-Fi LED bulbs represent an excellent choice for reducing electricity usage.Regularly servicing and maintaining your home appliances is essential for optimal functionality and efficiency. Appliances that are not properly maintained are known to consume excessive energy, so routine maintenance can prolong their lifespan and reduce energy consumption. Learn more about the importance of cleaning exhaust fans.Install a power strip if you have several electronic devices or appliances that need to be plugged into a single electrical outlet. This allows you to easily turn off all devices at once when they are not in use, preventing unnecessary energy consumption often referred to as ""phantom"" energy loss.One of the simplest and most effective methods to lower electricity costs is by turning off electrical devices such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when they are not in use.","During summer months, many households experience a significant increase in electricity consumption due to higher cooling needs.
