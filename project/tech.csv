The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (MMNS) is calling the public to slither into discovery at its annual World Snake Day celebration, which this year will take place on Friday, June 13, 2025. The event provides participants with an exclusive chance to meet live snakes, learn from experienced naturalists, and uncover the ecological significance of these much-maligned reptiles.While World Snake Day is officially observed on July 16, museum authorities have advanced their celebration to an early date because of climatic issues in observing some snakes during the hottest part of the summer.explained Aaron Holbrook, MMNS Assistant Director.The museum's timing of holding the event during mid-June as opposed to July is strategic. Numerous indigenous species of snakes will seek refuge underground during peak summer heat, becoming less accessible and harder to display for educational exposure.“Once the heat kicks in, a lot of these species go underground to escape it,” Holbrook explained. “By holding the event earlier, we’re able to introduce the public to a wider variety of species, including some rarely seen in the wild. ”Some of the snakes showcased in the event form part of the permanent collection of the museum, while others are temporarily harvested from the wild for use in education purposes and responsibly released back to their natural habitats afterwards.The MMNS World Snake Day celebration promises a combination of education, conservation messaging, and entertainment that is family-friendly. People will be able to:MMNS has a mission to change people's attitudes about snakes from fear to respect by emphasizing their vital role in ensuring healthy ecosystems. From pest control to balancing biodiversity, snakes offer natural services that are beneficial to agriculture, public health, and native wildlife.""The more we learn about these animals, the better we can conserve them—and ourselves,"" Holbrook said. Along with live demonstrations, the museum will offer materials that address frequent misconceptions like:These subjects will also be addressed in The Clarion-Ledger's upcoming Snake Week, a special daily series of articles on snake science, conservation concerns, and recent wildlife encounters throughout the state.Adults: $9Seniors (60+): $8Children (3–18): $7Children 3 and under and MMNS Foundation members: FreeFood and refreshments will be available for sale from Spotter's Snack Shack, on the grounds.Whether you are an inquisitive child, a wildlife conservationist, or just someone wanting to overcome your fear of snakes, MMNS World Snake Day presents a unique and interactive experience with some of nature's most intriguing reptiles.

In a series of Instagram stories, Katy Perry shared what she felt about the riots and how a deep injustice is being done to the people who built the city.""Los Angeles has lived under three flags: Spain, Mexico, and the United States.

Jensen Huang’s AI warning

Your iPhone's NEW Home is India: Apple's new Manufacturing HUB!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that programming artificial intelligence (AI) is similar to how one “programs a person”. Speaking at London Tech Week recently, Huang said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. Admitting that computing was hard historically, he said “We had to learn programming languages. We had to architect it. We had to design these computers that are very complicated”. “Now, all of a sudden ... there’s a new programming language. This new programming language is called ‘human,’” Huang added. ""Most people don't know C++, very few people know Python, and everybody, as you know, knows human.”Jensen Huang continued: “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely.”“And the thing that’s really, really quite amazing is the way you program an AI is like the way you program a person.”Explaining further, Jensen Huang gave an example saying, “You say, 'You are an incredible poet. You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.”“And when it answers, you could say, 'I feel like you could do even better.' And it will go off and think about it and it will come back and say, 'In fact, I can do better.' And it does do a better job.”Jensen Huang’s comments after he warned of changing workplace due to AI. Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in May this year, he said “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.”Huang’s message underlines a critical paradigm shift — the disruption caused by AI won’t simply be about outright job loss through automation but about a growing divide between those who harness AI as a tool and those who do not.","Jensen Huang said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121746988,imgsize-30406,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang-theres-a-new-programming-language-It-is-called.jpg"

New UAE Dirham symbol: All dos and don’ts you must know for correct use and official compliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-uae-dirham-symbol-all-dos-and-donts-you-must-know-for-correct-use-and-official-compliance/articleshow/121776894.cms,"The new UAE dirham symbol blends national heritage with modern design, featuring a ""D"" with two lines for physical currency and a circular ring for its digital version / Image (X)

Where the Dirham Symbol Should Be Used

Physical currency : Printed on banknotes and coins.





: Printed on banknotes and coins. Cheques, invoices, and receipts : Displayed to represent amounts clearly.





: Displayed to represent amounts clearly. Point of Sale (POS) systems and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) : For transaction displays.





: For transaction displays. Online and in-store price tags : Ensuring price visibility and uniformity.





: Ensuring price visibility and uniformity. Financial apps and accounting systems: Used within user interface (UI) fields for clarity.





Where the Symbol Should Not Be Used

It should not be used as a logo or branding element.





Avoid using it on splash screens or headers.





When writing amounts in words, always use “Dirhams” instead of the symbol.





How to Use the Dirham Symbol Correctly





Keyboard Placement:

Placement Rules





In single-language contexts, the symbol should be centered relative to the number.





In dual-language contexts, place the symbol in the top-left corner.





Maintain a minimum clear space of 2mm around the symbol to preserve visibility.





On Cheques

In the ‘amount in figures’ field: place the symbol before the numeric value, keeping the symbol the same size and weight as the numbers.





In the ‘amount in words’ field: spell out “Dirhams” rather than using the symbol.





On Receipts

Place the symbol before the numeric value.





Use the same font, size, and weight for consistency.





Text should be in English, right-aligned, with appropriate spacing.





On Price Tags

The symbol should appear directly before the numeric value.





Keep the font, size, and weight consistent.





Use either the symbol or “AED” (the currency code), not both.





Maintain clarity and legibility, especially in busy retail settings.





Dos and Don’ts for Using the Dirham Symbol

Dos:

Maintain the shape and direction of the symbol relative to the text.





Ensure proportional spacing and size in relation to numerals.





Use sufficient contrast so the symbol is easily readable.





Use either the symbol or “AED,” but not both together.





Always position the symbol to the left of the numerals.





Keep a clear space around the symbol to avoid crowding.





Respect the geometry and proportions of the symbol in all uses.





Don’ts:

Do not distort or alter the symbol in any way.





Avoid combining the symbol with “AED.”





Do not reduce contrast or add any decorative elements that could obscure the symbol.





Avoid incorrect positioning or sizing, such as placing the symbol after numerals or making it disproportionately large or small in a way that diminishes the clarity of the symbol.







As the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) moves forward with the digital transformation of the dirham, the guidelines for the new symbol are a crucial step toward harmonizing physical and digital currency usage. The Digital Dirham, expected to launch for retail use in late 2025, will be issued through licensed financial institutions like banks, exchange houses, and fintech companies. This digital version will utilize blockchain technology to enhance security, reduce transaction costs, and streamline cross-border payments, offering instant, secure settlements with smart contract capabilities for multi-party transactions. Integrated into a secure wallet and smart contract–enabled platform, the Digital Dirham will support retail, wholesale, and cross-border payments, providing a seamless and convenient user experience across various transactions.



This move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to establish the dirham as a leading global currency, underpinned by the nation’s recent adherence to the FX Global Code. As the first central bank in the Arab region to join this code, the CBUAE is bolstering the dirham's credibility by committing to best practices in currency trading, reinforcing transparency, market integrity, and ethical standards. These developments signal a new chapter for the dirham, not only strengthening its role in the UAE's financial ecosystem but also positioning the currency to play a more influential role in the global digital payments space.





On March 27, 2025, the UAE unveiled a new symbol for its national currency, the dirham. A blend of national heritage and modern design, the symbol represents not just the UAE’s financial stability but also its vision to strengthen its role in the global economy. Unveiled by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), the symbol features the English letter ""D"" flanked by two horizontal lines, inspired by the UAE flag, signifying the dirham's enduring strength. The design, rooted in classical Arabic calligraphy such as Thuluth and Diwani, reflects elegance and authority through its sweeping curves and pointed endings. The Digital Dirham symbol takes this a step further, incorporating a circular ring around the ""D"", symbolising security, continuity, and the UAE's forward-looking financial ecosystem. The use of the UAE flag’s colours in the digital design reinforces national pride, while the circular motif signifies a tokenised, blockchain-based currency, aiming to enhance global connectivity and transactional efficiency.As part of this launch, local authorities have provided clear guidelines on how the symbol should be used across various platforms to maintain consistency and clarity.The authorities emphasize consistent application of the symbol across both physical and digital platforms to maintain clarity and coherence in financial communications. Here’s where the symbol is intended to appear:The guidelines also specify clear restrictions to avoid misuse or dilution of the symbol’s meaning:The symbol is assigned to the number 6 key on keyboards for easy access.","The new UAE dirham symbol blends national heritage with modern design, featuring a ""D"" with two lines for physical currency and a circular ring for its digital version.

More than a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche famously declared that “God is dead.” But in the fetid, pitch-dark tunnels beneath Gaza—where air was scarce, food scarce still, and the future nearly absent—God and Nietzsche coexisted.For dozens of Israeli hostages taken during Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, attack, survival meant something more than physical endurance. Inside those underground cells, belief returned with unexpected force—sometimes in the form of sacred verses from the Book of Psalms, other times through the secular wisdom of Nietzsche’s existential despair. What united them was the same core truth: the need for meaning, for something to hold onto when everything else—light, freedom, identity—was stripped away.Omer Shem Tov, 20 at the time of his abduction, had been a secular Israeli, waiting tables and planning a post-army trip to South America. He was seized at the Nova music festival, along with friends, and quickly spirited into the Gaza tunnel network—lowered underground in a plastic tub.Days into his captivity, without access to clocks or sunlight, Shem Tov began to pray. He clung to Psalm 20—“May the Lord answer you on a day of distress”—a passage that, by eerie coincidence, his mother was reciting back home in Herzliya, unaware her son had adopted the same verse as his mantra.For him, faith didn’t emerge as sudden revelation, but as necessity—a response to isolation, uncertainty, and fear. He began blessing his food, making promises to God, and vowed to don tefillin in prayer if he ever returned home.But if God gave him ritual, Nietzsche offered something else: a reason to endure. A saying frequently repeated among hostages was drawn from the German philosopher, popularised by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl: “He who has a why can bear with any how.” It had reportedly been spoken by Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American hostage, before he was executed by his captors. The phrase reverberated through the tunnels like scripture. One hostage later had it tattooed on his arm.Shem Tov wasn’t alone in finding God in Gaza. Other hostages, like Eli Sharabi—who survived 491 days in captivity only to learn that his wife and two daughters had been killed—described saying the Shema Yisrael prayer each night and attempting to recite the kiddush over water when wine wasn’t available.Ritual became resistance. For many, Jewish observance wasn’t imposed by identity politics or external pressure—it was personal, a lifeline in the most dehumanising conditions imaginable. One hostage described saving a bottle of grape-flavoured drink for the Sabbath prayer. Others placed their hands on their heads in lieu of skullcaps. To the captors, it may have seemed like theatre. To the hostages, it was meaning.And yet, alongside God, Nietzsche endured. Stripped of everything familiar, hostages turned to a philosopher who had buried God in the pages of The Gay Science but also taught generations that suffering could be endured if one had a reason. In the absence of hope, they made purpose. In the absence of time, they made ritual.Even Shem Tov’s captors unwittingly played a role. After an Israeli military unit passed above ground, the gunmen handed Shem Tov reading material they had recovered—suspecting hidden codes. Among the texts: religious literature, and a printed card of Psalm 20. No names, no signatures. Just the verse. It mirrored the exact same card that had been handed to his mother months earlier by a hostage support group.At one point, Shem Tov spent 50 days in a dark, suffocating tunnel cell. He was given a biscuit a day, a few drops of brackish water, and suffered asthma attacks that went nearly untreated. In desperation, he begged God to move him—anywhere else. Within minutes, his captors relocated him to a better chamber. Whether miracle or coincidence, he saw it as divine intervention.From there, he survived through quiet cooperation—cleaning, cooking, helping clear debris after tunnel collapses. He maintained the Sabbath. He saved a bottle of drink for a moment of blessing. He kept faith alive in a place designed to crush it.Now home, he prays daily with tefillin, just as he promised. He has toured Jewish communities in the US, speaking not only of suffering but of resilience. His mother, too, now observes the Sabbath. Theirs is not a tale of religious conversion, but of rediscovery—of how stripped of society’s noise, ancient traditions and modern philosophy became tools of survival.","Omer Shem Tov, 20 at the time of his abduction, had been a secular Israeli, waiting tables and planning a post-army trip to South America.

A Smoother Journey for All: Beyond Just Savings





As the mercury rises and summer travel plans ignite, Dubai International (DXB) is making journeys smoother and more affordable for thousands of outbound passengers. In a strategic move perfectly timed for the bustling season, Dubai Airports has announced a significant reduction in long-term parking fees across all its terminals. This initiative comes as DXB prepares for one of its busiest periods, expecting to welcome and wave off an astounding 250,000 passengers daily throughout June, a clear indicator of the upcoming travel surge.Designed to ease the financial burden of extended trips and, crucially, to alleviate congestion at drop-off zones, this special offer is now live. From June 10 to June 30, travellers utilizing Terminal 1 Car Park B, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 at DXB can take full advantage of these newly reduced long-stay parking rates.Under this compelling new offer, long-term travellers now have access to exceptional value:These updated rates represent a substantial saving compared to the standard tariffs, providing a much-needed sense of relief and peace of mind for UAE residents embarking on extended vacations abroad.The introduction of these discounted rates is more than just an enticing offer; it's an integral part of Dubai Airports' broader strategy to significantly enhance passenger flow and streamline the entire airport experience during its peak operating season.By offering compelling prices for official airport parking, the airport is actively encouraging travellers to choose designated parking facilities over curbside drop-offs. This deliberate shift aims to markedly reduce the often-frustrating traffic bottlenecks that can occur at terminal entrances, ensuring a less stressful start to any journey.Furthermore, the benefits of this summer offer extend beyond just those flying out. Visitors arriving at DXB specifically to pick up incoming guests are also advised to utilize the airport’s designated car parks or convenient valet services. Importantly, these visitors too can now benefit from the very same reduced parking rates under the summer promotion.","Travellers can now park for up to two weeks for just Dh300 across all DXB terminals.

When & where to see it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dont-miss-it-uaes-strawberry-moon-last-chance-until-2043-when-where-to-see-it/articleshow/121752387.cms,"The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE from approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 until 5:55 AM on June 12 (Representational Image)

The Lunar Arrival: Times and What to Expect

Best Views: Where to Look Up

Why until 2043: A Rare Lunar Standstill





As the sun dips below the horizon on Tuesday, a rare and truly stunning sight awaits those gazing at the sky across the UAE: the Strawberry Moon, the last full Moon of Spring 2025. This particular moon event holds special meaning, confirmed to be visible throughout the Emirates, not least because it's the last time this specific phenomenon will appear so remarkably low in the sky until the year 2043. For anyone eager to witness nature’s grand show, tomorrow, June 11, offers a chance not to be missed.The exact times for this heavenly display have been carefully set. Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, Operations Manager at the Dubai Astronomy Group (DAG), told Gulf News on Tuesday, June 10, that ""The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE, with moonrise at approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 and moonset at 5:55 AM on June 12."" This generous time frame, stretching from evening twilight into the early morning, gives plenty of opportunity for viewing. Importantly, Khadijah Hasan Ahmed also confirmed that the Strawberry Moon will indeed be visible everywhere in the UAE, easing any worries about where to see it. The best part, she stressed, is how easy it is to watch: ""And the best part is that you don’t need any special equipment to see it.""For residents wanting the most impressive views of this lunar wonder, simplicity is key. You can simply step outside and look towards the eastern horizon soon after the moonrise at 7:32 PM.The Strawberry Moon is expected to be seen with just your eyes, assuming the skies are clear. Khadijah Hasan Ahmed suggested that the best places to watch are usually wide, open areas like peaceful beaches, the vastness of the desert, or elevated spots that offer a clear view. Even in the city, the Moon can still be seen if you have a clear line of sight to the eastern horizon. While looking with your bare eyes is a wonderful experience, she thoughtfully added, ""Of course, using binoculars or telescopes would definitely enhance the view,"" promising an even more detailed look at the Moon’s surface.This particular moon event, as highlighted by Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, is ""a beautiful, easy-to-watch celestial event that connects us with the universe."" She warmly described the Strawberry Moon as the final full moon of Spring and ""one of the most visually striking, often appearing larger and more golden when it rises."" It's important, however, to remember its name doesn't mean its color: despite its appealing name, the Strawberry Moon will not actually look pink or red. Its usual color, affected by air conditions when it's low on the horizon, is typically a warm yellow or a bright orange.The true charm and compelling reason not to miss this Full Strawberry Moon on June 11 comes from its connection to a truly rare natural event: a Great Lunar Standstill. This significant alignment of the Moon happens only once every 18.6 years, making tomorrow's event an exceptionally rare pairing.Khadijah Hasan Ahmed, using information from the astronomy app Star Walk 2, explained the phenomenon's different effects in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres: ""In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be the lowest Full Moon until 2043, staying unusually close to the horizon. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, it will be the highest Full Moon until 2043."" This precise and rare position is directly due to the major lunar standstill cycle. ""It’s like the Moon’s version of a solstice,"" she clarified, offering an easy comparison for its unique path.To be clear, For those in the Northern Hemisphere, including the UAE, this particular Full Moon on June 11 will be the lowest seen in 18.6 years. It'll rise and set at its farthest points to the southeast and southwest. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the opposite: they'll see their highest Full Moon this month, with their lowest coming in December. This happens because the Moon's orbit is tilted about 5.1 degrees compared to Earth's path. When this tilt combines with Earth's own 23.4-degree tilt during a major standstill, the Moon appears at its most extreme positions. This complex interplay means the June 11 Strawberry Moon isn't just a pretty sight; it's a rare cosmic event that won't appear this low again for almost two decades.","The Strawberry Moon will be visible in the UAE from approximately 7:32 PM on June 11 until 5:55 AM on June 12.

Harvey Weinstein GUILTY In Explosive Retrial But There’s A Twist In The Case





After a three-week trial, Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty on one charge of committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree by a Manhattan jury. The disgraced movie mogul was found guilty of assaulting Miriam Haley, but was acquitted of a second charge of sexually assaulting Kaja Sokola. The jury did not reach a unanimous verdict on a charge involving Jessica Mann, who alleges that Weinstein raped her. The judge has advised them to continue deliberations.Weinstein was convicted earlier in New York and was sentenced to 23 years in prison. This conviction was overturned on appeal. A second conviction in California resulted in a 16-year sentence.On Monday, the jurors left without a verdict as they clashed with each other on convicting Weinstein. The trial centred on three women - a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress, and a model - who accused Weinstein of using his power in Hollywood to sexually abuse them.In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women. While not all reports resulted in criminal charges, a separate sex crimes conviction for Weinstein in California means he is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men. Weinstein's attorneys argued in the court that all physical interaction was consensual and offered evidence that the three women had continued friendly relationships with Weinstein.","Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty on one charge of committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree.

Error-free UPI transactions: NPCI bans nicknames in UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/error-free-upi-transactions-npci-bans-nicknames-in-upi-payments-heres-how-it-will-benefit-users/articleshow/120721570.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a significant move to enhance user safety and transparency in digital transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’, as recorded in the Core Banking System (CBS), during peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-merchant (P2PM) transactions.In a circular dated April 24, 2025, the NPCI issued an addendum to its earlier guidelines, mandating UPI apps to ensure that only the bank-registered name of the recipient is shown on the transaction confirmation screen and in the transaction history.The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.According to NPCI, the ""ultimate beneficiary"" is the person or entity receiving funds for services or goods provided. Going forward, names fetched directly from the Validate Address API – the same used to retrieve official bank names, will be the only ones shown to payers. Names derived from QR codes, contact lists, or user-defined labels will no longer be permitted.“This change is being introduced to help customers verify they are sending money to the correct beneficiary and to reduce risks of misdirected payments,” NPCI stated in its communication to UPI ecosystem members.Many UPI apps currently allow users to modify payee display names or generate aliases, making it easier for fraudsters to impersonate trusted brands or individuals. Going forward, this loophole will be shut.NPCI has clearly instructed that apps must disable any feature that allows users to edit or customise beneficiary names within their interfaces.The circular comes amid growing concerns over rising UPI-based frauds, often caused by misleading display names that do not match official records. “This step can drastically reduce accidental transfers and fraudulent transactions. Displaying only the bank-verified name adds a key layer of authentication,” said Rahul Jain, CFO at NTT DATA Payment Services India according to an ET report.The change will particularly impact small merchants who fall under the P2PM category, such as kirana store owners or street vendors, who often receive payments via QR codes embedded with non-official names. Once enforced, customers will be shown only the CBS-registered name, not the store’s brand name or any custom label.“This will bring much-needed clarity for users and reduce errors. It enhances trust and makes the payment ecosystem more secure,” said Atul Gupta, head of risk & compliance at Cashfree Payments.Despite some anticipated transition challenges for users accustomed to aliases or nicknames, experts believe the change is a step in the right direction. As Mukesh Chand, senior counsel at Economic Laws Practice, explained, “It helps reduce anonymity and gives users more confidence before authorising a transaction.”By standardising the way beneficiary names are displayed, NPCI aims to make UPI payments safer, more transparent, and less prone to manipulation.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) applications to display only the ‘ultimate beneficiary name’ The directive must be fully implemented by June 30, 2025, failing which non-compliance action will follow.

Linking of CGHS beneficiary ID with ABHA ID : Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID. This directive comes from the Department of Health & Family Welfare under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as stated in an office memorandum dated March 28, 2024.According to the memorandum, linking CGHS beneficiary IDs with ABHA IDs is now mandatory starting from April 1.Existing CGHS beneficiaries must complete this linking process within 30 days.Before proceeding to link your CGHS beneficiary ID with your ABHA ID, let's take a moment to understand what ABHA ID is and how it benefits central government employees. Here’s a detailed guide explaining the step-by-step process of linking these IDs.According to ET, when you visit a government hospital or facility, they typically assign you a unique ID for your health records . However, this ID is only accessible to that specific hospital or centre. This means that each time you visit a new hospital, wellness centre, or program, a separate ID is generated for you. As a result, patients must keep track of multiple IDs and documents, carrying them everywhere they go.On the other hand, every hospital or wellness centre is responsible for creating and managing your health records independently. To simplify this process and enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare facilities, the central government introduced the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). ABHA serves as a single account that can be used across all government hospitals and programs, streamlining the management of health records.Each Ayushman Bharat Health Account card features a distinct 14-digit identification number known as the ABHA ID. It's important to note that you can generate an ABHA number free of charge.ABHA can be a digital storage space for your medical records, accessible online. With your unique ID, you can store a range of documents, including prescriptions, diagnostic reports, and discharge summaries, all within your ABHA account.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, having an ABHA number simplifies the process of accessing and sharing health records digitally. Since the entire process is digital, central government employees are relieved from the burden of maintaining physical copies of their medical treatments.It's advisable for every citizen to have just one health ID to make the most of the healthcare system. This ensures optimal utilisation and efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem.It's important to understand that as a patient, you have complete control over your health records. You can selectively choose which medical records to link with your health ID and share them with your healthcare provider.According to a circular issued by the department in January 2023, health records are shared using a Health Information Exchange Consent Management System. This system ensures that data is only shared among healthcare information providers and users with the explicit approval of the individual to whom the data pertains.Furthermore, as per FAQs released by the National Health Authority on its website, only data collected for specific registries, such as the health ID registry, healthcare professional registry, and healthcare facility registry, is stored centrally. This emphasises the importance of privacy and data security in managing health records.For central government employees enrolled in CGHS, here's a guide on how to link your beneficiary ID with the ABHA ID, following the health department's circular issued last year:","Effective April 1, central government employees enrolled in the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) are required to link their CGHS beneficiary ID with their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) ID.

EPF withdrawal claim : When it comes to claiming withdrawals from the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), many members are finding the process slower than expected, states an ET report. Members have had problems after submitting withdrawal claims from their EPF accounts. Some are concerned because they haven't received any updates since filing their claims, the report claimed.Some EPF members used social media to ask questions and complain to get the EPFO 's attention. In response to most questions about claim updates, the EPFO's official account stated, “Dear member, normally it takes 20 days to settle a claim or release the PF amount.”If your EPF claim isn't settled within 20 days, you should file a complaint with the EPFO. The EPFO explained in response to a tweet from an EPF subscriber, “Dear member, kindly register your grievance on http://epfigms.gov.in and you can track your grievance status at http://epfigms.gov.in”To avoid delays, make sure to:1.Choose the appropriate form for your type of claim. The paperwork for EPF account transfer is different from that for EPF withdrawal.2.Ensure you meet the requirements for EPF withdrawal.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5.

This model is complex enough to stress test modern chips and expose their true training capabilities.According to the data, Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips.In the fastest result, a cluster of 2,496 Blackwell chips completed the training task in just 27 minutes. By contrast, more than three times that number of Hopper chips was needed to match or better that performance.At a press conference, Chetan Kapoor, chief product officer at CoreWeave — which collaborated with Nvidia on the benchmark tests — highlighted a broader industry trend.“Using a methodology like that, they're able to continue to accelerate or reduce the time to train some of these crazy, multi-trillion parameter model sizes,” Kapoor said, referring to a shift from massive monolithic systems to modular training infrastructures made up of smaller chip groups.The benchmark results underline Nvidia’s dominance in the AI training space, even as rivals like China’s DeepSeek claim competitive performance with fewer chips. As the race to power ever-larger AI systems intensifies, chip efficiency in training tasks remains a critical metric.","N Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast per chip as the previous-generation Hopper chips, new data shows.

Mitsubishi is recalling nearly 2 lakh SUVs in US over software issues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mitsubishi-is-recalling-nearly-2-lakh-suvs-in-us-over-software-issues/articleshow/121810430.cms,"List of Mitsubishi SUV models recalled for software issues and other details



Mitsubishi has recalled nearly 200,000 SUVs in the US due to a software issue that causes the rearview camera to freeze, which could increase the risk of a crash. The Japanese car maker announced this recall on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website. Mitsubishi reported the recall earlier this month as the company stated that this is an expansion of a similar recall issued in May 2023, identified as recall no. 23V345. The issue specifically involves the rearview camera freezing during operation. Here are all the details about the SUV models that have been recalled and how Mitsubishi is working to fix the issueThe affected models include 2022–2024 Outlander and 2023–2025 Outlander PHEV SUVs, bringing the total impacted vehicles to an estimated 198,940.The problem originates from improperly programmed software that can trigger a black screen when the driver shifts into reverse within 40 seconds of startup or remains in reverse for more than six seconds.These same symptoms prompted a smaller recall in May 2023 covering some 2022–2023 Outlander and Outlander PHEV models, but reports of camera freezes and screen reboots persisted through early 2024.Dealers first flagged audio-control issues in mid-2023, followed by recurrent software lockups and display blackouts.After investigating customer complaints—six field reports and 358 warranty claims—Mitsubishi concluded on May 23, 2025, that a new recall was necessary.Owners whose vehicles were previously repaired under recall 23V345 will require this updated software as well. Going forward, all Outlanders built after April 22, 2025, will ship with the corrected software.Mitsubishi will notify dealers starting June 16 and mail owner notification letters on June 30. Dealers will perform the software update free of charge.Owners who incur reasonable expenses due to the recall will receive instructions in their notification letter for reimbursement through Mitsubishi’s Customer Relations Department.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists this action as recall number 25V369000; Mitsubishi’s internal reference is SR-25-001.https://youtu.be/zQHfPjzFgEA","Mitsubishi has recalled nearly 200,000 SUVs in the US due to a software issue.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121792924,imgsize-1260269,width-400,resizemode-4/AC-Blower-Function-in-Car-During-Winter-Season.jpg"

The Browser Company launches AI-first browser Dia in beta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-browser-company-launches-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/articleshow/121808508.cms,"The Browser Company has released its AI-powered web browser Dia in beta, marking a dramatic shift from traditional browsing toward artificial intelligence integration . The new browser positions AI as its core feature, allowing users to interact with an intelligent assistant directly through the address bar without visiting separate AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude.Dia's standout capability lies in its seamless integration of AI functionality into everyday browsing tasks. Users can query information across all open tabs, generate drafts based on tab content, and receive web summaries through a built-in chatbot. The browser's address bar serves triple duty, handling website navigation, search queries, and AI interactions automatically based on user input.The launch comes after The Browser Company discontinued development of Arc browser last year, acknowledging that while Arc gained enthusiast popularity, its steep learning curve prevented mass adoption. CEO Josh Miller recognized that users increasingly rely on AI tools for various tasks, prompting the company to reimagine browsing entirely around artificial intelligence.Built on Google's open-source Chromium project, Dia maintains familiar browser functionality while adding advanced AI features. The ""History"" feature allows the AI to reference seven days of browsing data for contextual responses, while ""Skills"" enables users to create code snippets for customized shortcuts and layouts.Although AI integration in browsers isn't entirely new, Opera and Google Chrome offer similar features, Dia distinguishes itself by making artificial intelligence the central experience rather than an add-on feature.Current Arc users receive immediate access to Dia beta, with invitation privileges for other users. Interested users can join the waiting list through The Browser Company's website as the company prepares for broader public release.","The Browser Company has released its AI-powered web browser Dia in beta.

Facebook-parent Meta sues company behind app that uses AI to generate nude images,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-sues-company-behind-app-that-uses-ai-to-generate-nude-images/articleshow/121808472.cms,"What Meta said about the measures it has taken



Facebook parent company Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind CrushAI, an app that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate nude images without consent. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong where the company is based, aims to prevent CrushAI from advertising on Meta’s platforms, including Instagram and Facebook.The legal action follows a January report from 404 Media, which revealed that CrushAI—also known as Crushmate—had placed over 5,000 ads on Meta's platform. Data showed that 90% of CrushAI’s traffic originated from Meta, indicating that the app’s advertisements were highly effective in directing users to nonconsensual image-generation tools.Meta acknowledged the challenge of enforcing its policies against such advertisers.“This is a highly adversarial space and bad actors are constantly evolving their tactics to avoid enforcement, which is why we continue to invest in the best tools and technology to help identify and remove violating content,” the company said previously.While talking about the latest action, Meta said, “This legal action underscores both the seriousness with which we take this abuse and our commitment to doing all we can to protect our community from it.”“We’ll continue to take the necessary steps—which could include legal action—against those who abuse our platforms like this,” Meta added.Meta announced that any removed ads from nudify apps will now be shared with other tech companies via the Tech Coalition’s Lantern programme. This will enable major platforms such as Google, Discord, Roblox, Snap, and Twitch to take similar actions against violators. Additionally, Meta is enhancing its detection technology to better identify deceptive ads, even when they do not explicitly feature nudity.","Facebook parent company Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind CrushAI.
