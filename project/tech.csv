I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible.

But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder

Sophia Kianni

.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…”

How the latest funding round will help Phoebe Gates Phia app

“There are enough clothes on the planet for the next six generations. We don’t need to buy new clothes.

The rise in secondhand fashion is really exciting. We just need to make it a lot easier for consumers.”





Microsoft founder Bill Gates ' daughter Phoebe Gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (AI) shopping startup, Phia. The new funding values the company at $180 million. However, Phoebe Gates’ father has yet to invested in the venture. Instead, the Bill Gates donated his time and experience to her daughter’s startup. Earlier this year, the tech billionaire took to professional networking site LinkedIn to announce that he was doing a customer service shift to support the team in the days following the launch of the app. He said when a daughter asks for help at her startup, the only right answer is yes.In his LinkedIn post, Bill Gates shared a short clip offering a glimpse of his shift working in the customer service department of his daughter’s app. He wrote:The latest round of funding is a massive leap in value for Phoebe Gates' startup, coming just months after the New York-based company finished its first fundraising round. It will make the startup one of the most-watched companies in the booming AI market.The company has attracted a long list of famous backers. According to a pitch deck viewed by Bloomberg, investors include Hailey Bieber, Kris Jenner, Sheryl Sandberg, and Spanx founder Sara Blakely.Phia has been designed to serve as an intelligent shopping assistant. Its being offered as an AI agent that will fix the messy online shopping experience. According to the company, customers usually struggle to find what they want and companies end up advertising to people who aren’t interested and Phia will be able to resolve it.As a computer and mobile phone browser extension, Phia searches for products, price comparisons, and real-time discounts to help users in their buying decisions. Second-hand options are also highlighted by Phia to further assist people in shopping more 'green'.Explaining her startup's objective, Phoebe Gates said to Elle:The new financial round is being led by major investment firms, including Notable Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and Khosla Ventures; investors with a history of supporting giants in the tech sector, such as Airbnb.Phia has been downloaded 750,000 times in just eight months. The idea by Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni was born while living in a Stanford dorm room; the initial plans were to make a smart tampon but later changed to fashion technology.A $250,000 grant from a Stanford social entrepreneurship program enabled them to work on the project full time and eventually move to New York. Kianni also took a break from her studies so that she could quickly learn everything about the industry they were going to work in, she told Vogue.Earlier, Phoebe Gates told Elle that when she first floated the idea to her parents, Bill and Melinda Gates, they urged her to treat it as a side project. She followed their advice by joining Stanford's night program after relocating to New York and completing her degree in 2024.","Microsoft founder's daughter Phoebe Gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (AI) shopping startup, Phia.

"Watch: Black bear attacks keeper during stage show at Hangzhou Safari Park, viral video triggers safety debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/watch-black-bear-attacks-keeper-during-stage-show-at-hangzhou-safari-park-viral-video-triggers-safety-debate/articleshow/125827140.cms,"



A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China's Zhejiang Province on Saturday.

UAE traffic alert: Key Emirates Road link to shut from Dec 11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-traffic-alert-key-emirates-road-link-to-shut-from-dec-11/articleshow/125888586.cms,"RTA issues alert ahead of major Dubai roadworks / Image: File

RTA's immediate traffic impact

Why the work is happening?

Alternative roads and diversion

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area.

(E311): This is the main parallel highway to Emirates Road. Motorists can transition to the E311 earlier in their journey, as it offers a vast network of interchanges that connect directly to areas like Al Barari, Dubai Investment Park (DIP), and ultimately the Jebel Ali area. Sheikh Zayed Road (E11): While a much busier and more central route, the E11 runs closer to the coast and is often used as a long-distance alternative, particularly for those heading toward Jebel Ali Port or Abu Dhabi.

Dubai–Al Ain Road (E66): For traffic approaching the E611 from the eastern side of Dubai, the E66 serves as a critical connector. If the specific exit loops at the E611/Lehbab intersection are closed, drivers are advised to continue on the E66 and utilize the next available exit or interchange to double back or access local roads.

Al Yalayes Road (D57): This road is a high-capacity link, especially vital for commercial traffic moving from Jebel Ali Port and the surrounding Free Zone. It can be used to connect traffic between the Sheikh Zayed Road (E11) and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311), effectively bypassing the core E611 work zone.





From Thursday, 11 December 2025, authorities will temporarily close the slip-road at Bridge No. 7 on Emirates Road for vehicles travelling from Ras Al Khaimah towards Al Dhaid. Motorists affected by the closure are being asked to use nearby alternatives such as Bridge No. 6 and the recently opened Khorfakkan Road Tunnel while the work is under way. The closure and diversion were publicly announced as part of traffic advisories issued on December 10.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611). The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.The work began on December 11, 2025, and was deemed essential to facilitate the complex construction required for a major upgrade project. Commuters traveling north on E611 who needed to exit at this point were immediately impacted and directed to use the newly implemented diversion routes signaled by the RTA.This closure is part of wider, phased improvements to the Emirates Road (E611) corridor designed to boost capacity and safety on one of the UAE’s main arterial routes.The stretch has been targeted for lane and interchange upgrades in a larger Dh750 million expansion plan launched earlier in 2025 that aims to increase lane capacity on key segments, shorten commute times and ease congestion for drivers travelling between Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, Sharjah and Dubai.That expansion includes widening lanes and upgrading interchange No. 7 with multiple new bridges, work planned to increase throughput and cut travel times sharply for long-distance commuters.For commuters whose primary route involves the E611 and requires an exit into the southern or western Dubai areas, several major arterial roads serve as primary alternatives, depending on the traveler's starting point:These detours were strategically planned to reroute vehicles around the construction zone, maintaining access to the critical roads which link key economic and residential districts, thus minimizing long-term disruption. This vital junction connects the major Emirates Road (E611) with the Jebel Ali-Lehbab Road and Al Qudra Road, making its smooth operation essential for the entire southern corridor of Dubai.",The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai issued a traffic alert announcing the immediate closure of a critical stretch on Emirates Road (E611) The closure specifically targeted the slip road used by northbound traffic heading towards the important Jebel Ali–Lehbab Road/Al Qudra Road junction.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125889079,imgsize-37730,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-traffic.jpg"
Australian teens can’t stream on Twitch anymore due to new regulations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/australian-teens-cant-stream-on-twitch-anymore-due-to-new-regulations/articleshow/125920899.cms,"Image Via Reddit

Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse

Twitch restricts under-16 users in Australia to keep minors safe

Image Via Reddit





Twitch is making a big change for its younger users in Australia. From now on, anyone under 16 can’t create a new account on the platform, and all existing accounts for under-16 users will be deactivated on January 9, 2026. This is part of new Australian online safety laws aimed at protecting minors on social media and streaming platforms. The government wants to make sure young people are safe online, and social platforms like Twitch are now required to check users’ ages before allowing them full access.For teens who are already using Twitch, this change will have a noticeable impact. Anyone under 16 will lose the ability to stream, chat, follow channels, or manage subscriptions. The good news? They can still watch Twitch streams without logging in, so they won’t be completely cut off from content. To comply with the law, platforms may use different ways to verify age, like photo ID checks, facial age estimation, or digital ID tokens. At the same time, companies are encouraged to offer privacy-friendly alternatives, so minors don’t have to share too much personal information.This new rule is part of a bigger effort by Australia to protect young people online.Lawmakers are concerned about cyberbullying, mental health, and the pressures social media can put on minors. Studies have shown that teens are at higher risk of anxiety, depression, and body image issues when exposed to online platforms without limits. Twitch isn’t the only platform affected, other social media services are adjusting too, though rules vary. Discord, for example, is treated as a messaging app and might not face the same restrictions.For Australian teens who currently stream, this means losing access to their channels, subscribers, and monetization until they turn 16 and pass Twitch’s age verification process. While it might be frustrating, the restriction is temporary. Once users meet the age requirement, they can return to streaming and regain full access to their accounts.Australia’s new regulations highlight the country’s commitment to online safety, and Twitch is working to create a safer space for younger users. For teens dreaming of streaming, it’s just a pause, not the end. Safe and responsible streaming can wait a little longer, but the passion doesn’t have to stop.Also Read: Valkyrae’s “questions she’s never been asked” video reveals her long-term streaming plans","Twitch is making a big change for its younger users in Australia.

Day 1 Abu Dhabi’s Bridge Summit

Idris Elba empowering Africa

$2.8 trillion revolution

‘Leapfrog’ advantage





Abu Dhabi’s BRIDGE Summit opened today (Dec 8, 2025), bringing together creators, platforms, investors and stars to map how AI, creators and global storytelling will reshape media. The three-day event mixes headliner keynotes, hands-on sessions and dealmaking, and the tone is unapologetically ambitious.The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), immediately setting a bold tone for the future of global media. Running for three days, the event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.The scale is truly global, with more than 400 speakers, including policymakers and innovation leaders, and attendees from 182 countries.Organizers emphasized that the summit is designed to be the global industry’s new home, a dedicated space for forging high-value partnerships, developing production ecosystems, and exchanging expertise. As stated in the evocative opening film, the message is clear: ""Abu Dhabi is not looking toward the future; it is building it.""A major highlight was the panel featuring Hollywood superstar Idris Elba, who stated he views his own identity as a ""bridge"" between his heritage, the stories he tells, and global audiences. His core mission is to empower African creators and rewrite the continent's global narrative, which has long suffered from misrepresentation.Elba identified a critical issue: many African creators who achieve viral success are blocked from receiving earnings by banking restrictions and digital barriers. To solve this practical problem, he created Akunna (named after his middle name), a platform centered around the Akunna Wallet designed to ensure creators can actually be paid for their work.The opening sessions underscored the sheer economic power of the sector, noting that global media and entertainment generated over $2.8 trillion last year. The line between traditional creative fields is rapidly blurring; today, musicians are becoming developers, and filmmakers are building immersive digital worlds. Key discussions centered on technology, revealing that nearly 70% of content creators are already utilizing AI tools in their work.Speakers explored AI's promise for efficiency and scaling creativity, but also highlighted the associated risks to integrity, authorship, and truth. The consensus was that while AI is a powerful tool, the priority must be establishing frameworks to guide its ethical use and rebuild trust in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.Elba stressed that Africa has a unique advantage: the ability to ""leapfrog"" old infrastructure and build entirely new creative systems, citing the global success of Afrobeats as powerful proof. He argued that the potential for African gaming and fantasy is immense because it operates on a ""blank canvas.""However, he sharply criticized the lack of governmental support, pointing out that some African nations still do not have a dedicated film policy. His message to policymakers was direct: if you want a healthy creative ecosystem, you need infrastructure, distribution, and protection, not just conversation.He concluded that while AI is not the enemy, ""actual intelligence is more powerful than artificial intelligence,"" and requires strong frameworks to maintain authentic human creativity.Beyond panels, BRIDGE is a marketplace: organisers expect the summit to catalyse MoUs, studio deals and investment into production hubs and creative platforms. Abu Dhabi’s push to host the event signals a strategic shift, the emirate wants to be a media-tech crossroads that connects capital, talent and festivals.","The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) The event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.

Madinah’s Taibah University action

Why this happened?

Advice for students and staff

What is Blackboard?





The academic routine at Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia , saw a sudden, mandatory shift this week, prioritizing the safety of its community over traditional classroom attendance. Taibah’s notice cites National Center of Meteorology reports as the reason for the suspension; students were directed to Blackboard for remote study instructions. The university announced the suspension of all in-person classes across its extensive network of campuses, immediately transitioning to a fully digital learning environment.The suspension of physical attendance applied comprehensively to the university’s main campus in Madinah and all of its subsidiary branches located throughout the wider Madinah region. This decision was specifically implemented for Monday, December 8, 2025. To ensure educational continuity without delay, all scheduled lessons and lectures were immediately converted to a distance learning format.The university confirmed that instruction would be conducted entirely through the established Blackboard system. This switch demonstrated the institution’s prepared infrastructure for managing disruptive events while upholding academic obligations.The critical reason behind the rapid change was a severe weather warning issued by the national meteorological body. The university’s announcement, reported by Al-Riaydh newspaper, was made following official reports from the National Center of Meteorology (NCM).These reports indicated the high probability of heavy rainfall across the area, posing a significant risk to commuters and campus safety. The primary motivation for the suspension, confirmed by university officials, was the deep concern for the safety of both students and administrative staff and faculty. The university affirmed that this pre-emptive step was taken in coordination with all relevant specialized authorities tasked with managing regional weather crises.Students and faculty should: (1) log into Blackboard before scheduled class times to confirm session links and any revised assessment arrangements; (2) follow Taibah University’s official social channels and the university portal for real-time notices; and (3) avoid travel to campus while alerts are active. The university’s message stresses that classes remain in session remotely, so attendance and coursework expectations continue as normal unless otherwise announced.Blackboard is Taibah University’s official online learning platform used to deliver classes, assignments, exams and course materials remotely. When in-person classes are suspended, Blackboard becomes the main way for students and teachers to continue lessons without interruption.Students can access Blackboard through the university portal or the mobile app. After logging in with their university ID, they can open each course page to find live class links, lecture recordings, assignments and announcements. Teachers may also upload new schedules or send messages about any changes. Students should keep notifications enabled and check their course dashboards regularly, especially during weather-related closures.The decision by Taibah University reflects a broader pattern of instability in the region's weather conditions. Contextual reports, including the Saudi Gazette, confirmed that the NCM had warned of a widespread rainy spell commencing around this time, affecting not only Madinah but also neighboring regions like the Makkah highlands.","Taibah University in Madinah, Saudi Arabia, suspended all in-person classes this week.

Drive with extreme caution and secure all outdoor belongings.Conditions are expected to be light but hazardous, primarily due to reduced visibility and active thunderstorms.This weather event is important because it combines several hazardous elements at once: intense rainfall that can cause sudden valley run-off and flash floods, strong gusts that reduce visibility and produce dust/sand squalls in some regions, and lightning that raises the risk for outdoor workers and travelers. Together these factors can disrupt road travel, damage infrastructure, and create dangerous conditions in rural and urban areas alike. Regional forecasts and emergency services are preparing for rapid response.","Saudi Arabia’s National Center for Meteorology (NCM) has issued a series of weather alerts, including red, orange and yellow warnings.

A city for everyone





Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations, bringing the wider shelter project to about 89% completion of the target 762 units. The RTA says the rollout forms part of a long-term plan to modernise street-level public transport infrastructure and make waiting for buses more comfortable and reliable for everyone.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai has reached a major milestone in modernizing the city’s public transport network, rolling out hundreds of state-of-the-art bus shelters. This ambitious initiative aims to construct a total of 762 sophisticated shelters by the end of 2025.To date, the project is near completion, with 595 shelters already installed, marking a substantial 89% overall progress. This upgrade is far more than an aesthetic facelift; it’s a pivotal step toward cultivating an integrated urban environment that supports sustainability and enhances the daily lives of residents and visitors.The strategic importance of this project is immense, as the bus network currently serves over 192 million passengers annually.To maximize efficiency and ridership, the RTA carefully selected locations based on future demand, high population density, and the need for integration with other ""soft mobility"" options. Many of the new stops are major hubs, designed to handle high volumes of traffic, with certain locations serving more than ten bus routes per shelter.The new shelters boast a sleek, contemporary aesthetic that perfectly complements Dubai’s modern architectural landscape. However, the true transformation lies in the user-friendly technology and comfort features integrated into the design.For stops classified as Primary Shelters (serving over 750 passengers daily), the RTA provides top-tier amenities:The RTA categorizes all 762 shelters into four tiers based on passenger volume to ensure appropriate amenity levels at every stop:In a move showcasing Dubai's focus on future technology, the RTA is also exploring the use of 3D printing technology for the construction of some shelters on a trial basis, blending functionality with cutting-edge innovation.H.E. Mattar Al Tayer, Director General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, emphasized the project's greater role, stating: “The new shelters represent a pivotal step in RTA's efforts to develop an integrated urban environment that encourages residents and visitors to use public transport, improves quality of life, and promotes comfort and well-being.”He added that ensuring the shelters combine modern design with services that guarantee a better mobility experience is key to reinforcing public confidence in the network and supporting long-term sustainability objectives, including emissions reduction.The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader vision for inclusive urban development. The design of every new shelter is fully compliant with the Dubai Universal Design Code, ensuring complete accessibility for all community members. This focus includes dedicated, comfortable spaces specifically tailored for wheelchair users (People of Determination).This commitment to inclusivity supports the ""My Community … A City for Everyone"" initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai.",Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has completed 595 new public bus passenger shelters across key locations.

UAE launches new one-step service to renew passport and emirates ID together – All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-launches-new-one-step-service-to-renew-passport-and-emirates-id-together-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/125800645.cms,"Emiratis can now renew passports and Emirates ID together in one step via UAEICP app/Representative Image

One step renewal

Citizen driven design

Faster and efficient

Part of zero bureaucracy





In a major step towards seamless government services, the UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process. The move, part of the “Zero Bureaucracy” initiative, promises to cut processing times, reduce administrative hurdles, and transform the way citizens manage key identity documents.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has launched a smart service enabling citizens to renew both passports and Emirates ID cards together. Previously, individuals had to complete separate applications for each document, navigate different forms, and make multiple payments. The new system consolidates all these steps into one seamless process via the UAEICP smart application.Citizens whose passports have expired and whose Emirates ID is due to expire within six months will now see an option to conveniently renew both documents on a single page within the app. The platform also allows users to easily update personal information and photographs without needing to re-enter data multiple times.The integrated renewal service directly addresses public concerns identified during the “Zero Bureaucracy Expo.” Many residents expressed frustration over managing different expiration dates for passports and ID cards, which often caused administrative confusion. By synchronizing the renewal process, the government ensures that citizens no longer have staggered expirations, simplifying document management.Officials highlighted that the system’s development was shaped by citizen input, evolving from a simple service improvement into a comprehensive smart solution. This reflects a broader commitment to responsive governance, where services are designed to meet the real needs of the public.The new unified platform is expected to cut processing times by at least 50 per cent while reducing inquiries and customer calls by around 40 per cent. It supports the national goal of simplifying procedures, improving government responsiveness, and delivering faster, more integrated services.By centralizing the management of all passports and identity documents for an entire family, the application represents a major leap forward in digital government services. The initiative prioritizes efficiency, quality, and tangible impact, leveraging technology and best practices to make citizens’ lives easier with minimal effort.This development forms part of the second phase of the Zero Government Bureaucracy (ZGB) Programme, launched in June by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The program aims to establish a world-leading model for government services, emphasizing proactive, user friendly, and fully integrated digital solutions.The unified passport and Emirates ID renewal service exemplifies the UAE government’s ongoing commitment to eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles and creating a modern, citizen-centric public service environment.","UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process.

Strategic supercar policing

Beyond speed





Dubai Police has once again elevated its globally recognized luxury patrol fleet, unveiling an ultra-rare, customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory, a 755-horsepower powerhouse that is one of only seven units modified worldwide. Marking 12 years of their strategic use of supercars, the Ministry of Interior confirmed the addition will be deployed in major tourist attractions like the Burj Khalifa to boost visibility, assist visitors, and underscore Dubai's commitment to security, innovation, and high-end excellence.Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks. This machine is powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque. This power allows the patrol car to rocket from 0 to 100km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 320km/h.The unveiling of the customized Ferrari took place at an anniversary event held in front of the iconic Emirates Towers. This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence.

By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet.

Who is a Nominee?



Who is a Legal Heir?

Difference between a Nominee and a Legal heir

Aspect Nominee Legal Heir Role Custodian Owner Transfer of Assets Can be done without any legal formalities. Requires testamentary documents for proof of ownership. Powers No power to transact, use, or transfer assets. Power to use and transact assets as an owner. Appointment Owner can appoint anyone, but some institutions specify certain conditions. Determined by succession/personal laws. Legal Right Cannot contest ownership legally. Can contest ownership in a court of law.

When individuals open bank accounts, invest in mutual funds, or buy insurance, they are often asked to name a nominee.However, many people mistakenly assume that the nominee automatically inherits the assets. In reality, the nominee is not always the final recipient — the ownership rights belong to the legal heir, reported ET.Understanding the distinction between these two is essential to ensure that your wealth is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets.The nominee’s role is limited to holding and managing the assets until they are legally transferred to the rightful heirs.According to ET, the nominee cannot sell, trade, or make any transactional decisions about the assets.The account or policy owner can appoint anyone — family, friends, or acquaintances — as a nominee, though financial institutions often prefer close family members.In some cases, the nominee and the legal heir can be the same person, which helps in ensuring a smoother transfer of assets.The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.To claim ownership, the legal heir must produce valid documents such as a will or other testamentary proof.If there is no will — a situation known as dying intestate — the heir is determined as per the country’s succession or personal laws, reported ET.While a nominee can initially access the assets, only the legal heir can claim them permanently or challenge ownership in court.Experts quoted by ET emphasise that having clarity on this difference helps avoid disputes and ensures that the savings reach the intended family members or beneficiaries.Therefore, it is advisable to regularly update both nominees and wills to align with one’s estate planning goals.","A nominee acts as a temporary custodian of the deceased person’s assets. The legal heir or beneficiary is the rightful owner of the assets once the original holder passes away.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification



Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying

Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise. JPMorgan is currently trying to convince a Delaware judge to halt these payments, arguing that the system is being misused.The saga has become a major lesson in the risks of fast-paced startup acquisitions. JPMorgan’s failure to properly verify Frank’s user base before buying the company has left it entangled in one of the most embarrassing and expensive due diligence failures in recent corporate history.","Charlie Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid.

What Disney's letter to Google claims





Disney has announced a multi-billion deal with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. And interestingly, just hours before OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the deal on big stage, Disney sent a 'Cease-and-Desist' letter to Google claiming that the search giant and its products infringe Disney's copyright on a “massive scale”. The letter says that Google's AI models have generated content resembling characters from Frozen, Deadpool, Star Wars, and others. According to reports in Deadline and Variety, Disney wants Google to stop infringing on its copyrighted works.Disney's notice comes just a day before the company announced its billion-dollar deal with OpenAI, which will allow Sora AI users to create videos using more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars. The AI-generated videos will also reportedly appear on Disney Plus, too, which CEO Bob Iger teased last month.Disney's letter against Google follows cease-and-desist letters that the company has sent earlier to Meta and Character.AI, as well as litigation Disney filed with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery against AI companies Midjourney and Minimax alleging copyright infringement.“Google is intentionally amplifying the scope of its infringement, by making its infringing AI Services available across so many channels to so many consumers, flooding the market with infringing works, and reaping enormous profits and other value from its unlawful, harmful, and damaging exploitation of Disney’s copyrighted works,” says the letter from David Singer, the Jenner & Block attorney representing Disney.“Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney’s valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale. And compounding Google’s blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google’s AI Services are branded with Google’s Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google’s exploitation of Disney’s intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney,” adds the letter, which Variety has reviewed.In the letter, Disney further claims that Google “has refused to implement any technological measures to mitigate or prevent copyright infringement, even though such measures are readily available and being used by Google’s competitors.”The letter cites models like Veo, Imagen and Nano Banana. It calls on Google to cease further copying and distribution of Disney IP in its AI services, as well as to implement technical measures to “ensure that no further outputs” infringe on the company’s works.","Disney sent a 'Cease-and-Desist' letter to Google claiming that the search giant and its products infringe Disney's copyright on a'massive scale' The letter says that Google's AI models have generated content resembling characters from Frozen, Deadpool, Star Wars, and others.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125919631,imgsize-78050,width-400,resizemode-4/disney-invests-1b-in-openai-in-deal-to-bring-characters-like-mickey-mouse-to-sora-ai-video-tool.jpg"

“We also knew that the most problematic thing that was going to happen was going to be energy, because energy and data centres were going to become a bottleneck alongside chips. So we designed our machines to be super-efficient.”

How Google is planning to meet AI’s energy demands

“If you’re running a cluster for training, and you bring it up and you start running a training job, the spike that you have with that computation draws so much energy that you can’t handle that from some forms of energy production.”

""some new fundamental technologies to actually create energy in new forms,""

""If you want to build a data centre here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital in a weekend.""





Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian revealed that Google-parent Alphabet was well aware of artificial intelligence’s (AI) energy demands since a long time. He said that the tech giant was among the first to realise that the immense electricity needs of AI computing would become theinfrastructure bottleneck. Speaking at the recently held Fortune Brainstorm AI event in San Francisco, Kurian explained that Google Cloud, a significant player in the AI infrastructure landscape, took a long-term view of this challenge, prompting the company to plan how to source and use energy efficiently actively. He also highlighted that Google has been working on AI for a long time, well before the emergence of large language models, allowing them to anticipate and prepare for these energy constraints.During his interview, Kurian said:The International Energy Agency estimates that specific AI-oriented data centres use as much electricity as 100,000 households. At the same time, some of the biggest sites under construction could draw up to 20 times as much. Meanwhile, real estate firm Knight Frank has claimed that global data centre capacity is expected to grow by 46% over the next two years, which will result in AI’s energy consumption increasing by nearly 21,000 megawatts.At the event, Kurian outlined Google Cloud's three-part strategy to guarantee sufficient energy supply to meet growing demand. The first part involves diversifying the types of energy sources used to power AI computing as much as possible. Kurian also challenged the common belief that any energy source can work, arguing that this assumption is incorrect.He explained:The second element of Google Cloud's strategy focuses on maximising efficiency, including methods for reusing energy inside data centres, Kurian noted.The company currently employs AI in its control systems to track the thermodynamic exchanges required to utilise energy already brought into data centres.Lastly, the third component involves Google Cloud developingKurian added, though he didn't provide any additional details.Earlier this week, NextEra Energy and Google Cloud announced they're expanding their collaboration to develop new US data centre campuses that will feature new power plants.Technology leaders have also emphasised that energy supply is just as crucial to AI advancement as chip innovations and better language models. The capacity to construct data centres represents another potential bottleneck. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also recently highlighted China's advantage over the US in this area.Last month, Huang said,",Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian revealed that Google-parent Alphabet was well aware of artificial intelligence’s (AI) energy demands since a long time.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.
