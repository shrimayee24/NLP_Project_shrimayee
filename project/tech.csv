Army wants anti-drone systems integrated on its Russian tank fleets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-wants-anti-drone-systems-integrated-on-its-russian-tank-fleets/articleshow/120297070.cms,"Army is seeking advanced counter-drone systems for its T-90S and T-72 tanks

NEW DELHI: With Ukrainian drones destroying thousands of Russian tanks in the ongoing war, the Indian Army now wants new advanced counter-drone systems with both “soft and hard kill options” to be integrated on their Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks.In just the last one year, Russia is estimated to have lost around 3,000 tanks and 9,000 armoured vehicles to drones, artillery and anti-tank guided missiles fielded by Ukraine, some its own and others provided by western countries.Ukraine, of course, has also suffered huge military losses in the debilitating war underway since Feb 2022, which has led a few experts to even sound the death knell for the lumbering tanks in modern-day warfare.The over 11.5-lakh strong Indian Army is obviously worried about its fleets of the old 2,400 T-72 `Ajeya’ tanks and the relatively newer T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks (around 1,300 inducted of 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia), which are primarily meant for swift multiple thrusts into Pakistan during a conflict.Consequently, the force is looking for “platform-based” counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS), which can detect and neutralize FPV (first-person view) drones, swarm drones, loitering UAVs and kamikaze drones.Towards this end, a RFI (request for information) was recently issued for the preliminary acquisition of 75 C-UAS, with active and passive detection measures, and soft kill options like the capability to jam satellite-based navigational systems and RF (radio frequency) communication links of the hostile drones.For the hard kill, the C-UAS should provide requisite inputs to the anti-aircraft machine guns already mounted on T-90S and T-72 tanks. “The modular C-UAS will have to be integrated with the tanks without affecting their mobility. The sealing of tanks for deep fording and NBC (nuclear, chemical, biological) warfare protection should also not be affected,” an officer said.The design of tanks is based on the “equilateral triangle” of lethality, mobility and survivability, which leaves little scope for adding more armour protection. “Therefore, the need for integration of light-weight C-UAS,” he added.On the China front, the Army had managed to deploy some of the heavy T-90S and T-72 tanks (40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh after the confrontation erupted in April 2020. The plan now is to induct 354 indigenous light tanks (25-tonne each) for high-altitude warfare under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore.“The light tanks will come with integral counter-drone systems. All our future tank projects are being planned with enhanced survivability, especially against aerial threats, as well as connectivity. Requisite anti-drone safeguards will ensure both individual tank protection as well as area protection for force survivability,” another officer said.","Army is seeking advanced counter-drone systems for its T-90S and T-72 tanks.

Not disclosing criminal case 'moral turpitude': High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-disclosing-criminal-case-moral-turpitude-hc/articleshow/120290444.cms,"Representative Image

BHOPAL: If a candidate hides information about a criminal case against him while applying for a job, it amounts to "" moral turpitude "", regardless of whether he is acquitted later, Madhya Pradesh HC ruled, while upholding the cancellation of a job offer to an applicant at the Itarsi ordnance factory .The petitioner, Ram Bhuvan Yadav from Azamgarh in UP, applied for the post of turner (semi-skilled) in response to advertised vacancies in the factory. He appeared in a written test in May 2016 and then a trade aptitude test. He cleared both and made it to the merit list.After the results were declared, he submitted documents and a self-attestation form. During scrutiny, the office of Azamgarh collector notified the ordnance factory that a criminal case under Sections 254 (delivering an altered coin as genuine), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of IPC was pending against him in the UP district. Yadav was acquitted on Sept 23, 2016, but he had not mentioned the case and trial at the time of application. Also, when asked if he faced any criminal charges in the past, he had replied ""no"".Yadav appealed in Central Administrative Tribunal against the cancellation, but his petition was rejected. Then, he filed a petition in MP HC.","Ram Bhuvan Yadav from Azamgarh in UP applied for the post of turner (semi- skilled) Yadav was acquitted on Sept 23, 2016, but he had not mentioned the case and trial at the time of application.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120290467,imgsize-21068,width-400,resizemode-4/Court.jpg"

People observe Michael Jordan whenever he dances among others. A video is going viral where we see Michael Jordan dancing to the Kendrick Lamar song ""Not Like Us"" thus sparking all sorts of public reaction.During his podcast 7PM in Brooklyn Carmelo Anthony analyzed this moment by questioning if Jordan’s song request at the club officially made it an anthem. Anthony uses his thoughts to explain how sports meet music while creating social change.Carmelo Anthony and his co-hosts discussed the viral video of Michael Jordan dancing to Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us."" This track, which is notorious for its sharp critique of Drake, has sparked both controversy and praise. Anthony made a funny remark, ""Is 'Not Like Us' officially the GOAT diss song after the GOAT himself requested it to be played in the club?"" He further added, ""He GOATed it,"" highlighting the weight of Jordan's influence in popularizing the song.The conversation also highlighted the swift popularity of ""Not Like Us"" in clubs. Anthony was taken aback that Kendrick Lamar's song started to gain momentum ahead of Drake's, pointing out, ""He beat him [Drake] to the club. That was usually a Drake move."" The song's infectious hook and instant charm made it a quick favorite in nightlife spots. The panelists noted that Lamar's knack for grabbing the club's attention with this track marks a significant cultural change.After this fans are giving all sorts of reaction one user on twitter commented, “Drake at home throwing away all his J’s rn, crying, bout to caption some bs like “washed goats requesting my competition, SGA taking your spot, that’s a Canadian premonition”.While another couldn’t even believe what he had just seen and said, “Is this real? Lol”. One user commented on Twitter, ""Fam it's real tears coming from my eyes right now lmaoo. MJ doesn't even f**k with rap. This is a sick ass visual."".Well, people couldn't even believe what they were seeing, some people are arguing whether this incident is going to reignite Drake vs Kendrick Lamar's beef again.Next to their music discussion they exchanged thoughts about how celebrity power impacts music popularity.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial.

The stakes increase as you move closer to the mid- to endgame. Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one. This strain gives the consumers anti-gravity and glowing effects.$165 base, up to $200 with negotiationsThis strain has a 100% Addiction rating, making it among the highest rated in the game. The downside is that the right ingredients take grinding before you can sell it.

The consistent customer demand provides a secure source of income, and it can be a substitute for the premium-grade ingredients if you’re running low.$140–$160 per unitThis strain is a reliable option—not the most eye-catching or the most costly, but it provides consistent sales at little cost of concern.

Guide on obtaining Coca Leaves in Schedule 1

How to Make/cook Cocaine in Schedule 1 Game - How to use Cauldron

Unlocking Salvador Moreno

Purchasing Coca Seeds and cultivating into Coca Leaves

Harvesting and processing Coca Leaves

In Schedule 1 , you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire. When it comes to cocaine production, you will need to get Coca Leaves, which can be cultivated from Coca Seeds.However, these seeds aren’t readily available, and are a premium commodity. You will first have to unlock the exclusive dealer named Salvador Moreno, and then order these seeds from him. The guide below will walk you through the process of acquiring Coca Seeds, cultivating them into Coca Leaves, and processing them.To get started, you need to unlock Salvador Moreno, who is the exclusive supplier of Coca Seeds. The supplier operates from the Docks area, and you will have to reach the Enforcer I rank to unlock the same. To achieve the particular rank, you must expand your empire and successfully manage your operations in the other regions.After Docks is open for you, the next thing to do is establish connections with either Javier Perez or Mac Cooper. They will introduce you to Salvador Moreno, and you may then arrange the purchase of Coca Seeds in Schedule 1.As already stated, Coca Seeds are a premium commodity in Schedule 1, and you will have to pay the big bucks to acquire them. If you are ordering them through a dead drop, each seed will cost you $80, and there will be a purchase limit of $2,000 or 10 seeds per transaction. Alternatively, in-person purchases will require you to spend $150 per seed. These seeds will be a significant investment, so you must plan your finances correctly.Once you have got your hands on Coca Seeds, you must start with the cultivation. Planting them follows the same procedure as other seeds that you generally acquire from Albert. All you have to do is set up a grow tent or pot with soil, remove the seed cap, and plant the seed.If you've hired a Botanist in Schedule 1, the process becomes even easier. You must simply put the Coca Seed on an appropriate rack and assign the supplies. The Botanist will take up the entire growth process and would ensure optimal yield.You'll finally have mature Coca Leaves ready for harvest. After harvesting, you can transform these leaves into a sellable product by processing them in a Cauldron. The particular equipment is available upon reaching Enforcer I, and you can purchase it from Oscar for $3,000.Upon setting up the Cauldron, you can begin processing the Coca Leaves, with the standard recipe requiring 20 Coca Leaves and 1 unit of Gasoline. For a higher-quality output, you can also consider drying the Coca Leaves on a drying rack.Additionally, to completely streamline the production, you can consider hiring staff. A fully automated production for the particular drug requires you to have one Botanist, three Handlers, and four Chemists.","In Schedule 1, you have to cultivate, produce, and deal different drugs to expand your empire.

A steep price tag



What Katy Perry, Blue Origin crew saw in space

Fame flies free



If you can pay



Singer Katy Perry joined a Blue Origin flight on Monday alongside five other women, making headlines as part of the first all-female space crew in over 60 years.Blue Origin’s well-known New Shepard spacecraft can carry up to six passengers on a short journey beyond the Earth’s atmosphere, allowing them to experience weightlessness and see the planet from space.As of the latest launch on Monday morning, only 58 people have travelled more than 60 miles above Earth with Blue Origin since it began crewed missions in 2021.On May 19, 2024, Indian-born entrepreneur Gopi Thotakura made history by becoming the first Indian citizen to take part in a space tourism flight.How much would it cost for an ordinary person to take a similar trip?For those hoping to experience space tourism, it isn’t cheap. While Blue Origin doesn’t openly display ticket prices, its website does ask potential flyers to submit personal details and agree to a $150,000 deposit.Reports show that seats on earlier flights have fetched millions. One was even auctioned off for $28 million in 2021, writes USA today.The flyer also needs to be 18 years or older.Not everyone pays. Celebrities like William Shatner and Michael Strahan reportedly didn’t pay a rupee for their spaceflights.Other companies are offering similar experiences. A seat on Virgin Galactic’s sub-orbital flights costs around $450,000.In 2021, SpaceX launched a fully civilian mission into orbit, funded by billionaire Jared Isaacman, currently nominated to be Nasa chief, at an estimated cost of $220 million.For now, a seat to space is reserved for the ultra-rich or the ultra-famous. But the growing number of private players may one day bring the stars closer to the rest of us.","Singer Katy Perry joined a Blue Origin flight on Monday alongside five other women, making headlines as part of the first all-female space crew in over 60 years.

TOI Correspondent from London:

Over the years, patrons of Britain’s oldest Indian restaurant, ‘Veeraswamy’, have included Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Marlon Brando, Sharon Stone and David Cameron.A haunt of Indian maharajas and European royalty too, the King of Denmark even shipped out a cask of Carlsberg for staff to store for whenever he dined there.Now the Michelin-starred restaurant , which opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London, and today serves pineapple curry and chicken makhana au vin, is at threat of closure as the Crown Estate (property portfolio owned by King Charles), which owns Victory House, the building in which the restaurant is based, is refusing to renew its lease, which expires in June.The Crown Estate claims it needs to take the restaurant space back to extend the ground floor reception for offices on the building’s upper floors. Knocking through into Veeraswamy would give it an extra 11 sq mts.Veeraswamy’s founder, Edward Palmer, was the great-grandson of General William Palmer, and his wife, Begum Faiz Baksh, a Mughal princess. Gen Palmer was private secretary to Warren Hastings, first governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. It was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namita Panjabi in 1996.“Had they wanted to, they could’ve easily put the office reception on the first floor. I think they’ve come to the view that it’s too tiresome having a restaurant there, they want it to be all offices,” Mathrani (81), told the Times of London.If the Crown Estate refuses to allow the restaurant to stay put until he finds and fit out an alternative space, with its iconic décor inspired by the art nouveau of the 1920s and maharaja’s palaces, the restaurant will have to close, leading to possible redundancies and loss of business until a new site is found.Mathrani is taking the Crown Estate to court.A spokesperson for The Crown Estate told TOI: “The Crown Estate has a duty to generate value for the nation, while acting as responsible stewards for this historic part of London. We need to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House. This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible. Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”","Michelin-starred restaurant Veeraswamy opened in 1926 on Regent Street, London.

Four arrested over obscene AI images in Japan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/four-arrested-over-obscene-ai-images-in-japan/articleshow/120298055.cms,"Representative Image

TOKYO, JAPAN: Japanese police have arrested four people for selling obscene images created using generative AI in the first crackdown of its kind, local media reports said Tuesday.The four, aged in their 20s to 50s, allegedly made posters featuring indecent images of women and sold them on internet auction sites, public broadcaster NHK and other outlets said, citing police sources.Police could not immediately confirm the reports to AFP. NHK said the suspects had used free AI software to create images of naked adult women, who do not exist in the real world, using prompts including terms such as ""legs open"".They reportedly sold the posters for several thousand yen (several multiples of $7) each. Tuesday's reports said the arrests were Japan's first for allegedly selling AI-created obscene images.Concern is growing worldwide over the use of AI for malicious purposes including through deepfakes, which turn genuine photos, video or audio of people into false likenesses.Around 96 percent of deepfake videos online are non-consensual pornography, and most of them depict women, according to a 2019 study by the Dutch AI company Sensity.","Japanese police have arrested four people for selling obscene images created using generative AI.

Poll Do you support the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for European visitors to the UK? No Yes

Europeans Need Permit To Enter Uk, Trumps Reciprocal Tariffs Begin April 2

UK has introduced a new online entry requirements for European visitors from Wednesday, implementing a digital Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) permit as part of enhanced security measures.European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9. The system has already been operational for visitors from America, Canada and other visa-exempt nations since Britain's EU departure in 2020.UK border force chief Phil Douglas confirmed this implementation as part of a broader global rollout, emphasising its primary function as a security measure.The system aims to expedite entry procedures whilst enabling background checks on immigration history and criminal records. Douglas highlighted that approved travellers would benefit from faster border crossing through eGates.""The quid pro quo for the individual, though, is that we are building a contactless border, so if they're cleared for entry, they'll be able to use our new eGates and they'll be able to go through the border much more quickly,"" he added.During the initial buffer period, expected to continue until ""September or October,"" travellers can still proceed with their journeys. The ETA remains valid for two years, permitting stays up to six months.Applications opened to Europeans in March, covering approximately 30 countries, excluding Ireland. Applicants must submit passport photos and facial images through a smartphone app or government website, typically taking 10 minutes to complete.Whilst most applications receive swift responses, authorities advise allowing three working days. The requirement extends to all ages, though transit passengers not crossing UK borders are exempt following Heathrow Airport's concerns about European connection traffic.Heathrow, which handled 84 million passengers in 2024 with one-third from the EU, initially launched the scheme for Qatar in 2023 before expanding to Gulf nations. By January, it included about 50 additional countries including Argentina, South Korea and New Zealand.","European travellers must obtain an ETA permit, initially priced at £10 (12 euros), with costs increasing to £16 from April 9.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all- female space mission.

(AP Photo/Jason Redmond)

Suleyman suggests that the evolution of AI is going to work similar to that of the internet



Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recommends that young people experiment with artificial intelligence to prepare for a future where humans will develop ""symbiotic relationships"" with AI agents.""Play with these things,"" Suleyman said on the ""Big Technology"" podcast. ""Try them out, keep an open mind. Try everything that you possibly can with these models, and then you'll start to see their weaknesses as well.""The co-founder of Google DeepMind believes today's youth will inherit a dramatically changed workplace. ""Your day-to-day workflow just isn't going to look like this in 10 or 15 years time,"" he predicted. Future work will involve ""managing your AI agent, asking it to go do things, checking in on its quality, getting feedback, and getting into this symbiotic relationship.""Suleyman emphasized that people are too focused on AI's immediate applications while overlooking potential long-term impacts. He compared learning about AI to early internet adoption.""It's a little bit like saying, 'What should young people do when they get access to the internet for the first time?'"" Suleyman explained. ""Part of it is sort of obvious, where it's like — use it, experiment, try stuff out, do crazy things, make mistakes, get it wrong.""He noted that users, not creators, ultimately determine technology's development by discovering its best applications. ""The things that people choose to do with their phones, with the internet, with their laptops... are always way more inventive and surprising than anything you could possibly think of ahead of time,"" Suleyman said.His advice applies broadly, including to ""a 15-year-old who's in high school, thinking about what they do next in college or whatever, or whether or not they go to college.""Suleyman remains optimistic about AI's future, expecting innovation to accelerate as capabilities become ""really cheap — if not, like, zero marginal cost.""","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recommends young people experiment with artificial intelligence to prepare for a future where humans will develop ""symbiotic relationships"" with AI agents.
