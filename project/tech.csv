"Maha Kumbh stampede: 'As panic struck, people scattered, cries for help replaced holy chants'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-kumbh-stampede-as-panic-struck-people-scattered-cries-for-help-replaced-holy-chants/articleshow/117707078.cms,"Photographers Basabdatta Sarkar and Krishna Roy recount their experience at Prayagraj's Mauni Amavasya where an incident led to panic. Amid holy chants, a sudden pushback and screams marked the tragic scene at the sacred riverbank, highlighting the dangers of overcrowding during such massive gatherings.

At 1am, we joined the flow of humanity. We were 30m from the photographers' stage when the crowd suddenly stopped,"" write TOI photographers Basabdatta Sarkar & Krishna Roy. ""There was a pushback, followed by screams... Holy chants turned to cries for help.""Since we arrived Sunday in Prayagraj, all we heard were chants of ""Har Har Gange"" and ""Har Har Mahadev"" as millions of devotees made their way to Triveni Sangam. All drawn by the faith that bathing in the holy waters can lead to salvation.Wednesday, we knew, was the big day - Mauni Amavasya - the most auspicious of the six dates for the Amrit Snan. Crores of faithful were expected. Though there were six ghats, it was Sangam that drew everyone. There was a short window till 4am for devotees before only sadhus were allowed access to the river.By 1am, we joined the flow of humanity - not to bathe, but to reach a photographers' platform, hoping to capture the scale of this grand spiritual gathering. We were just 30m from the stage when the crowd suddenly stopped. A sharp pushback came, followed by piercing screams. First women, then children and men. ""Something must have happened. Is it a stampede?"" was our first thought.As panic took over, people rushed in all directions. We sprinted to the platform and somehow climbed up. From there, we saw a sea of heads bobbing up and down, with some suddenly getting sucked in and disappearing. The holy chants had been replaced by desperate cries for help.Soon, police whistles, ambulance sirens, and the sight of RAF personnel and mounted police filled the air. It felt like an eternity before the ambulances finally left, carrying the dead and injured. The aftermath was haunting - an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional cries of children, heaps of discarded clothes, footwear, and bags covered the ground, more than we had ever seen in our lives. We only hoped no one was trapped beneath them.We gathered our thoughts and cameras. We had come to capture vignettes of a vibrant spiritual celebration. We are leaving with frames of a heartbreaking tragedy.","At 1am, we joined the flow of humanity.

“The first thing that went through my mind was this must be a mistake. It didn’t seem real.”

A Father’s Worst Fear Becomes Reality



“Oh my. You’re just scared.”

“I’d do anything. I don’t want to die.”

A Fighter's Spirit: Isabella's Road to Recovery



“At the end of the day, the most important thing is your kids, your family, your loved ones—just to hold them close to you.”

Turning Pain into Purpose



Vlog 19: Ups And Downs

The former New York Giants star and TV personality broke down in tears as he shared the most terrifying chapter of his life—watching his daughter fight brain cancer. In Life Interrupted, an ABC special to be released soon, Strahan shares the raw and painful emotions of watching his 19-year-old daughter get diagnosed with medulloblastoma-an aggressive form of brain cancer-in October 2023. The trailer of the documentary captures his heartbreak as he recalls the moment he first heard the diagnosis:Strahan, known for his dominance in the NFL, found himself in unfamiliar territory—one where his strength and skills meant nothing. His daughter’s battle wasn’t one he could fight for her. The seven-time Pro Bowler admitted his fear, saying,No game plan, no strategy—just helplessness as he watched Isabella struggle through a grueling fight for her life.Before cancer sent her world spinning, Isabella was cutting out a niche for herself in the modeling world, strutting down the Sherri Hill runway with poise. After then enduring torturous brain surgery, she had to learn to walk and talk again—an utterly impossible hurdle for an otherwise vibrant young woman whose entire future lay before her. In the movie trailer, Isabella's poignant words strike like a sledgehammer:Isabella never let the cancer diagnosis define her. She attacked chemotherapy and radiation treatments with a determination that mirrored her father once battling relentless NFL defenses. By July 2024, it paid off. Doctors declared her cancer-free, and she didn't waste a minute returning to USC for her sophomore year, ready to reclaim her dreams.However, her journey did not only change her; it changed her dad. According to Strahan: ""This gave him a new life perspective:Isabella isn't just moving forward; she's using her story to help other people by creating YouTube vlogs and raising money for the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center , ensuring others who are fighting this battle have what they need to fight.As for Strahan, life has thrown him plenty of challenges, but none compare to this. Now a proud grandfather and an even prouder father, he watches Isabella move forward—stronger, wiser, and ready to take on the world.And if there's one thing we can learn from Isabella Strahan , it's that true strength isn't just about surviving—it's about thriving.

Prince Harry has shared a personal story about contacting his late mother, Princess Diana, through a psychic.

Dubai has been long celebrated as a global retail haven, and is now making waves in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Known for its expansive malls and top-tier brands, the city is seamlessly blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.Behind the luxurious displays and bespoke offerings lies a layer of AI-powered innovation that’s redefining personalisation, streamlining operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction. From designing jewellery to curating personalised shopping experiences, Dubai is setting new benchmarks in the global retail landscape.In today’s retail environment, customers seek experiences that resonate on a personal level. AI has emerged as the linchpin of this transformation. Amreen Iqbal , Founder and Creative Director of Piece of You, a custom jewellery brand in Dubai, emphasises the depth of this shift: “It’s about understanding the customer deeper—what they want, how they want it, and how we can make it special and unique to each customer. AI helps us do that.”Her brand employs AI-powered tools to enable customers to design unique jewellery pieces through virtual try-ons and bespoke customisation. “The ability to personalise jewellery at this level was unthinkable a few years ago. Now, with AI, it’s a reality,” she adds.Similarly, global e-commerce innovations have gained traction in Dubai. Sue Azari , an e-commerce consultant at, notes, “AI enables highly customised and intuitive customer experiences.”She cites Zalando’s AI-powered chatbot as a perfect example: “If you need an outfit for a Christmas party, you simply describe your needs, and the chatbot curates a complete look, including accessories. It’s like having a personal shopper who knows your wardrobe.”In the beauty sector, major players like Sephora are redefining the customer journey with AI. Through augmented reality (AR) and AI features, their app enables users to virtually try on products like lipstick shades while integrating seamless social sharing options. Azari explains, “It’s about creating an experience, not just a transaction.”Walid BenOthman, Managing Director at Bitpanda, in Dubai, added that AI-driven personalisation has created a 25% improvement in customer satisfaction, revenue, or cost reduction. “Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide 24/7 customer support, improving engagement and customer satisfaction.”He explained AI has made it easy to bring in hyper-personalised advertisements by analysing customer behaviour, creating more effective campaigns and higher conversion rates.Adding to Dubai’s retail innovation is the launch of theat Dubai Mall, as reported. The AI-powered store enhances the telecom retail experience by offering an array of cutting-edge features. Using AI and robotics, customers can explore products, make payments, and even collect purchases from automated lockers.The store is equipped with advanced facial recognition technology, enabling personalised interactions and tailored product suggestions. It epitomises Dubai’s vision to merge physical retail with AI-driven efficiency. As highlighted in several news reports, this initiative underscores Dubai’s commitment to revolutionising traditional retail through technology. report by GoGlobe has highlighted that Dubai AI’s impact extends beyond personalisation, revolutionising how brands market their products. Generative AI (genAI) has emerged as a game-changer, enabling dynamic, hyper-personalised advertisements and streamlining content creation.“AI doesn’t just generate content; it analyses performance metrics to refine strategies in real-time. It saves marketers countless hours and ensures campaigns are efficient and impactful,” explains Azari.Iqbal highlights AI’s ability to enhance marketing precision through predictive analytics, helping businesses target audiences with unparalleled accuracy. From creating dynamic ads to optimising email campaigns, AI ensures that every touchpoint is relevant and impactful.At Amazon, for instance, AI-generated product descriptions have not only increased efficiency but also improved SEO performance and consistency. “This is not just automation; it’s about making marketing smarter and more strategic,” notes Azari.While customers benefit from AI-driven personalisation, its operational applications are equally transformative. Gavin Jackson, Senior Vice President of Data and AI at Endava, highlights the role of AI in inventory management: “AI has turned inventory management into a science. Retailers can now accurately predict demand, ensuring shelves are stocked without over-ordering. It’s a win for both businesses and consumers.”Jackson explains that AI-powered systems can even trigger additional production when products start selling out, ensuring businesses never miss a sales opportunity. Logistics and supply chains are also undergoing an AI-driven revolution, with systems optimising delivery routes, warehouse layouts, and energy consumption. “It’s about creating an interconnected ecosystem where every touchpoint is as efficient as possible,” he adds.Dubai’s embrace of AI is propelling the city into a new era of retail excellence. By integrating advanced technologies across personalisation, marketing, and operations, the city is not only enhancing customer experiences but also setting a global standard for innovation in retail.As Iqbal aptly puts it, “The ability to create personalised, meaningful experiences isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. And AI makes it possible.”Dubai’s commitment to leveraging AI ensures that its reputation as a global retail hub remains stronger than ever, firmly rooted in innovation and customer-centricity.","Dubai is blending tradition with technology to reshape how consumers shop, interact with brands, and experience retail.

Xavier James Trudeau, the 17-year-old son of outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is stepping into the spotlight with the launch of his music career. Over the weekend, Xavier shared a teaser video on Instagram for his debut R&B single, ‘ Til the Night’s Done ', set to release on February 21, 2025.The promotional clip shows Xavier walking across a bridge at night, delivering lines like, “We could roll some, we could light one.” While the lyrics sparked speculation about a nod to cannabis—legalized in Canada by Justin Trudeau in 2018—the overall response has been overwhelmingly positive.Xavier’s debut marks a departure from his father’s political legacy, with Montreal-based musician Dan Boeckner joking on X: “I’m actually fine with this AS LONG AS Trudeau Jr Jr is formally banned from entering politics for the rest of his natural life.”Sophie Grégoire Trudeau , Xavier’s mother and Justin Trudeau’s ex-wife, expressed her support with a comment on the post: “Great work, guys!” Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation as Prime Minister earlier this month, has yet to comment on his son’s music debut.Fans and critics alike weighed in on Xavier’s Instagram teaser. Some praised his artistry, with comments like, “Congrats for making a song; hope you blow up!” while others were less enthused, posting remarks such as, “Just put the fries in the bag bro.”Xavier’s foray into music follows a tumultuous period for the Trudeau family. Justin and Sophie announced their separation in 2023 after nearly two decades of marriage. The couple shares three children: Xavier, 14-year-old Ella-Grace, and 9-year-old Hadrien.Justin Trudeau announced his intention to step down as Prime Minister earlier this month, emphasizing the importance of a competitive process to select the next leader of the Liberal Party.

with dense foam; uprooted trees and damaged roofs. Category 10 (Storm Gale): Extremely high waves and airborne spray; significant structural damage.

How are Gale winds formed?

Who issues Gale warnings?

Daytime Signal: Two red pennants.

Nighttime Signal: Alternating white and red lights.

A gale warning is an official alert issued by national meteorological agencies to inform the public and maritime communities of strong, sustained winds reaching speeds of 34-47 knots (39-54 mph or 63-88 km/h).These warnings are critical for saving lives and minimizing property damage in coastal and maritime regions.According to Surfer Today, a gale is a powerful surface wind, categorised between 7 and 10 on the Beaufort Wind Force Scale , an empirical tool developed in 1805 by Sir Francis Beaufort. The scale helps estimate wind speeds based on observable conditions, such as whitecaps on waves, tree movements, and structural damage.For example:The term ""gale"" originates from the Old Norse word gala (to scream), reflecting the loud, howling sound of strong winds .Gale-force winds occur when air moves rapidly between areas of high and low pressure. Coastal regions , estuaries, and even inland seas often experience these conditions.As per Surfer Today, specific topographies, like San Francisco Bay or Cape Town's Table Mountain, can funnel and intensify winds into gales.National meteorological agencies, such as the National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States, issue gale warnings. These alerts are part of their responsibilities, including real-time weather updates, hazardous weather warnings , and shipping forecasts.According to Surfer Today, gale warnings are maritime-specific in the US, with wind advisories issued for land-based events. Warnings are typically disseminated via FM broadcasts, television, VHF radio, official apps, and even flag or pennant systems at sea. For example:Mariners, fishermen, and water sports enthusiasts should heed gale warnings, as these winds create hazardous conditions like high waves and reduced visibility. Sports like surfing, windsurfing, and kiteboarding should be avoided during gale-force events.In the words of the NWS, a gale warning is triggered by “sustained surface winds, or frequent gusts, in the range of 34 knots (39 mph) to 47 knots (54 mph) inclusive, either predicted or occurring, and not directly associated with a tropical cyclone.”Gale warnings aim to protect both lives and property. Whether you’re at sea or near the coastline, staying informed through official channels and avoiding risky activities during these events is crucial.","A gale is a powerful surface wind, categorised between 7 and 10 on the Beaufort Wind Force Scale.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment .

Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Key components of hallmark on gold jewellery



Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110182999,imgsize-66608,width-400,resizemode-4/110182999.jpg"

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

The most expensive S series smartphone from Samsung continues the trend of refined aesthetics with a squared-off titanium frame and Gorilla Glass Armor 2. The Gorilla Glass Armor 2 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is scratch resistant and it also provides anti-reflective glass ceramic cover the the smartphone. The design is both durable and elegant, with a slimmer and lighter build compared to its predecessors. The phone now features smoother, rounded corners, making it more comfortable to hold. The ride side of the smartphone houses the volume rockers and the power button. Apart from waking up the smartphone, the users can also use the power button to activate Google Gemini. The bottom part of the smartphone houses the USB Type C charging case, the slot for S Pen and the SIM card tray. The front is dominated by a 6.9-inch AMOLED display and the rear of the smartphone houses the quad-camera setup placed neatly in the top right corner. The smartphone also comes with IP68 rating which makes it resistant to dust and water. The overall build of Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra exudes sophistication, maintaining its status as a flagship device.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra sports a 6.9-inch Quad HD+ Infinity-O-Edge AMOLED display. The display on the smartphone offers a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The screen is protected with a coating of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass which makes it resistant to scratches. We really liked the display on the flagship Samsung smartphone. It offers a crisp resolution, smooth 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and enhanced Vision Booster for vivid outdoor viewing. Samsung has further enhanced brightness levels, making it easy to view even under harsh sunlight. The colour accuracy and HDR performance ensure vibrant visuals, whether you're gaming or streaming videos.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is powered by Android’s most powerful and advanced chipset – Snapdragon 8 Elite. The smartphone comes in three variants – 12GB+256GB, 12GB+512GB and 12GB + 1TB. The smartphone performed well during our initial testing and we didn’t face any lag. We had a smooth experience during multitasking and gaming. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is backed by a 5,000 mAh battery which comes with 45W fast charging support. The smartphone also supports Qi wireless charging. Samsung claims that the smartphone can charge from 0to 65% in just 30 minutes. However, we are yet to test this functionality and the battery backup of the smartphone. The dual SIM smartphone comes equipped with an in- display fingerprint sensor and sports a quad rear camera setup.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra runs Android 15 operating system topped with the company's own layer of One UI 7. Samsung has also confirmed that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will get seven years of OS and security updates. Coming to One UI 7, the AI integration in One UI 7 feels more intuitive, with features like natural language search and context-aware multitasking. The AI features of the OS come with a significant new look, based on a new notification system that streamlines communication with easy access from the device's lock screen. It includes Now Bar, which highlights relevant activities across various features like Interpreter, Music, Recording, Stopwatch and more. One UI 7 also reduces visual clutter and offers a simplified homescreen, redesigned One UI widgets, and lock screen which enhances the user experience. We will talk more about the software in our detailed review of the smartphone.Same as its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra also sports a quad rear camera setup. The rear camera consists of 200MP main camera with f/1.7 aperture, 50MP ultra wide sensor with f/1.9 aperture, 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and f/2.4 aperture and 50MP periscope telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom and f/3.4 aperture. Front houses a 12MP selfie camera with f/2.2 aperture. The camera delivered some really impressive results during our initial testing. The primary sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra manages to capture incredible detail and dynamic range. The AI enhancements bring sharper portraits and more accurate colour reproduction. Features like depth-of-field control and Galaxy Log enhance creative possibilities and help users do much more with the camera. Also, the redesigned camera UX allows more intuitive control over advanced settings. Camera buttons, controls, and modes have been reorganised to make it easier to find the features you need and to give you a clearer preview of the picture you’re taking or the video you're recording. For the detailed camera analysis, you will have to wait for our detailed review.Overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels like a refined iteration of an already impressive formula.
