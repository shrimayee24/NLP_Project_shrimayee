Can the Rodgers-Adams reunion revitalize the Jets' season?



Aaron Rodgers & Davante Adams Talk Reunion After Trade To The Jets | Pat McAfee Show

Could Adams be the answer for Rodgers amid Williams' struggles?



In the wake of a tough Week 6 loss to the Buffalo Bills , New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers finds a silver lining with the return of former teammate Davante Adams . This reunion not only lifts team morale but also raises hopes for a turnaround in the Jets' struggling 2-4 season. The question on everyone's mind: can Adams rekindle the spark that once made them an unstoppable duo?Also Read: “[Jerry Jones] Was Out of Line”: Cowboys owner’s Radio outburst sheds light on NFL Media’s dark side, says Mike Florio After a disappointing loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6, New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has reason to celebrate: his former teammate, Davante Adams, is back in the locker room.Having a close friend by your side can boost morale, but the question remains—can Adams turn around the Jets' 2-4 season?Rodgers described Adams' return as surreal and reflected on his remarkable transformation from “fat to fit” by taking Rodgers' advice seriously. When asked if Adams could enhance the Jets' offense, Rodgers confidently stated, “Yeah, I mean, he can do a lot of different things. He can play all three positions: on the ball, receiver, off the ball, and slot. He’s got a high football IQ. I think he’s going to help.” That's high praise for the star wideout.Rodgers also expressed optimism for the team’s younger players, noting,“I think he can help teach the young guys who are willing and eager to listen coz he’s a master of route running and releases. He’s always working on his craft.” On his on-field chemistry with Adams, he added, “We click. I mean we could literally watch a highlight clip and both of us not only know the game, but the play in the situation and the thoughts that were behind and maybe a conversation that happened. So that’s a gift.” The statistics certainly backup Rodgers’ enthusiasm. (Via: EssentiallySports)The Green Bay Packers locker room was a powerhouse for Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams. Together, they lit up the field, with Adams racking up 622 catches, 7,590 yards, and 69 touchdowns in 108 games. Rodgers thrived alongside him, boasting a passer rating of 103.5, 28,368 yards, and 237 touchdowns. Yet, before reuniting with his old teammate, Rodgers criticized Mike Williams for the loss to the Bills.The Jets endured a disappointing Week 6, falling to the Buffalo Bills 20-23. Their performance was marred by red zone struggles, missed kicks, and penalties, but Aaron Rodgers notably highlighted a key mistake by wide receiver Mike Williams. “It’s two vertical [routes]. Allen [Lazard] is down the seam and Mike is down the red line. I’m looking at Allen, he puts his hand up and three guys go with him. So I’m throwing a no-look to the red line. And when I peek my eyes back there, [Williams] is running an in-breaker. He’s got to be on the red line. It’s the little things every single time.” he stated.This miscommunication proved costly, especially when the Jets needed a conversion on third-and-16, leading to an interception by Taron Johnson. Williams’ struggles extend beyond this moment; he has yet to score a touchdown this season, accumulating just 145 yards and 10 receptions with a longest catch of 22 yards.In contrast, Davante Adams of the Las Vegas Raiders is in excellent form, with 18 catches, 209 yards, and a touchdown over three games. The seasoned receiver boasts impressive career stats, including 10,990 yards and 96 touchdowns across 153 games.The Jets will look to turn their fortunes around against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday, October 21, at Acrisure Stadium, as fans eagerly await the potential Rodgers-Adams connection to spark a turnaround.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes delivers strong message to Travis Kelce and team following Chiefs' shocking offensive stats","New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers has reason to celebrate: his former teammate, Davante Adams, is back in the locker room.

The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, commonly known as CIBIL, plays an important role in this regard by providing credit scores to borrowers.According to ET, credit score helps banks make informed decisions about extending credit cards and loans.Your credit history influences your CIBIL score , which is calculated using a special method.Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity. Ranging from 300 to 900, a higher score indicates a stronger likelihood of loan approval. Banks and financial institutions use this score to assess the risk associated with lending money.1. Go to the official CIBIL website and click on 'Personal CIBIL score,' then 'Get Your Free CIBIL score.' Follow the link provided and fill in all the required details.2. If you don’t have a PAN Card, you can use an alternative identification such as Passport, Voter ID, Driver’s License, or Ration Card. Enter the number of the chosen ID.3.

Depth of credit: This refers to the duration of your existing credit history, calculated from the opening date of your oldest credit account.2. Long-term trend of outstanding balances: The overall trend of outstanding balances over time affects your score.3. Transaction history on credit cards: How you manage transactions on your credit cards impacts your score.4. Ratio of actual repayment amount to total amount due: This ratio indicates your repayment behavior and influences your score accordingly.5. Number of new accounts opened and number of accounts closed: Opening or closing accounts can affect your score, so managing these actions wisely is important.","Your CIBIL score is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and repayment capacity.

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

Why Google is being penalised

A federal judge has granted Google a relief in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games , temporarily halting a ruling that would have forced significant changes to the Google Play Store . However, Google is still required to comply with one aspect of the original order, according to a report.As per The Verge, starting November 1, the injunction on payment and revenue share is not stayed.The injunction reads:US District Judge James Donato granted Google's request to pause his October 7 injunction. The pause will remain in effect until the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals rules on Google's separate request for a longer stay during its appeal of the case.“We're pleased with the District Court's decision to temporarily pause the implementation of dangerous remedies demanded by Epic, as the Court of Appeal considers our request to further pause the remedies while we appeal,” a Google spokesperson said.Epic Games, maker of the popular game “Fortnite,” challenged Google's control over the Android app market. A December 2023 ruling that found Google guilty of illegally monopolising theAndroid app market could have significant financial implications for the tech giant.The initial injunction permitted alternative payment systems within apps, and stopped paying device makers to pre-install the Google Play Store. These changes could disrupt the Play Store's estimated $14.66 billion in annual revenue.Google argued that implementing these changes so quickly would introduce ""serious safety, security and privacy risks"" to Android users.","A federal judge has granted Google a relief in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games.

Judge Donato's order would have required Google to allow users to download third-party app stores through Play, permit alternative in-app payment methods, and stop paying device makers to preinstall Play.Google argued that implementing these changes so quickly would introduce ""serious safety, security and privacy risks"" to Android users. The company has appealed the jury's antitrust findings to the 9th Circuit.The case, brought by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, is part of a broader legal and regulatory scrutiny of Google's app store practices. The Play Store generated an estimated $14.66 billion in sales in 2020, and analysts have warned that forced changes could significantly impact Google's revenue.Epic Games has not yet commented on the latest development.

Early Success

Pro Model Surge

Challenges Ahead

Long-Term Outlook

Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16 , has good news for Apple in China . Bloomberg reports strong sales for Apple's newest iPhone in China, quoting research firm Counterpoint. Compared to the 2023 model, sales are up 20% in the first three weeks, according to Counterpoint Research data. This is a positive sign for Apple, after facing challenges in the crucial Chinese market last year.Though the smartphone market is stagnant, the iPhone remains Apple's most crucial product, generating roughly half of its sales.Strong iPhone sales in China are a positive indicator for Apple's overall performance.The iPhone 16's success can be attributed to several factors. A smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and existing user upgrades all contributed to ""substantial growth"" in China, said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam.Consumers are also gravitating towards pricier options, with sales of the top-tier Pro and Pro Max models jumping 44% compared to their predecessors.Despite the promising start, competition remains fierce. Local rivals like Vivo's X200 Pro, Huawei's upcoming Mate device, and updates from Xiaomi and Oppo threaten to steal market share. Additionally, the ongoing economic slowdown in China might lead some consumers to delay purchases until major shopping holidays like Singles' Day in November.While the iPhone 16 boasts AI features, the lack of a local partner for these features in China poses a potential hurdle. Analysts previously expressed concerns about this, as Beijing restricts foreign-developed AI models. Apple may need to collaborate with a Chinese company like Baidu to fully utilize these features in the region.While the initial response is positive, it remains to be seen how the iPhone 16 will fare throughout its lifespan. The success will depend on navigating intense competition and the ongoing economic climate in China.","Apple's latest iPhone series, iPhone 16, has good news for Apple in China.

Google Maps may move this weather feature on Android; here’s how it can change the map experience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-maps-may-move-this-weather-feature-on-android-heres-how-it-can-change-the-map-experience/articleshow/114351227.cms,"Representative Image

How this move may alter the map viewing experience







Google Maps' India-centric features



Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface. The tech giant is testing a new design of its maps service by relocating the weather widget to the ""Latest in the area"" sheet that appears from the bottom of the screen. Previously displayed in the top-left corner, the weather information is now reportedly appearing in the top-right corner of this expandable sheet.According to a report by 9to5Google, this change aims to declutter the map view and provide Google Maps users with a cleaner and less obstructed experience.The report also includes screenshots to show when the ""Latest in the area"" sheet is minimised, the weather widget appears in the bottom-right corner, allowing users to quickly access information without hiding the map.The latest update follows another recent simplification effort by Google, where the app's bottom bar was reduced from five tabs to three.While this change aims to declutter the map view, it may make it slightly less convenient to quickly check the weather while exploring the map.Currently available in the beta version (11.151.x) of Google Maps, this update hides the weather information behind an extra tap. Users who prefer to see the temperature, conditions, and AQI at a glance may find this change less efficient.It remains to be seen whether this design will make its way to the stable release of Google Maps. Feedback from beta testers will likely play a role in Google's decision to roll out this change more broadly.In July, Google Maps added 6 new features which are designed specifically for Indian users . These features use AI and collaborations with local experts to address common challenges faced by commuters across the country.With these features, Indian users got access to AI-driven navigation that optimises routes, information on EV charging stations, and enhanced public transport options. Additionally, Google Maps also partnered with local guides to provide curated recommendations for places to visit and things to do.These updates reflect Google's commitment to tailoring its services to the specific needs of users in different regions. By incorporating AI and local expertise, Google Maps aims to provide a more seamless and informative navigation experience for commuters in India.","Google Maps for Android is reportedly getting a more streamlined interface.

In a recent update, the web version of Google Photos now allows users to directly upload entire folders from their computers, eliminating the need for the Google Drive desktop app for certain workflows.Previously, uploading photos and videos to Google Photos could only be done by selecting individual files or using the Google Drive desktop app, which automatically synced designated folders with Google Photos.This new feature simplifies the process for users who prefer to manage their backups entirely within a web browser.

They will then have the option to select individual files or choose ""Back up folders.""Following these steps, users can browse their computer's file system and select specific folders containing photos and videos for automatic upload. Google Photos will then scan the selected folders and upload any new or unbacked up content.There are some limitations to the new feature. Currently, it seems to be rolling out gradually, so it may not be available to all users immediately. Additionally, unlike the Google Drive desktop app, which runs continuously in the background, Google Photos on the web will only check for new files in selected folders when the user manually visits the website.","Google Photos now allows users to directly upload entire folders from their computers.

Jey Uso comes to NXT to YEET with NXT Champion Trick Williams: NXT highlights, Oct. 8, 2024

Since breaking out as ""Main Event"" Jey Uso, the current WWE Intercontinental Champion has been living large and enjoying his first reign with the prestigious title. However, despite the many monumental moments Jey Uso has had in his wrestling career, one particular experience still haunts him—and it happened during one of the most popular events in WWE history.In a recent interview with Metro , Jey Uso was asked about his most embarrassing moment in WWE. His answer took many by surprise, as it came from one of the most beloved segments in the company's recent history.Uso candidly admitted.The ""Ucey"" moment took place during an episode of WWE SmackDown on October 28, 2022, when tensions were high between Jey and the leader of The Bloodline, Roman Reigns. During a confrontation, honorary Bloodline member Sami Zayn stepped in to de-escalate the situation. Zayn humorously remarked that Jey wasn’t feeling very “Ucey” that night, and what started as a lighthearted jab soon became a sensation among fans, even catching Roman Reigns off guard with its unexpected humor.What made this moment memorable, aside from the humor, was how it took on a life of its own. The term ""Ucey"" became a fan-favorite catchphrase, and despite the embarrassment Jey felt at the time, it became a lasting piece of WWE lore.Jey recalled.For Jey, the struggle wasn’t just about keeping a straight face; it was about maintaining his professionalism in an environment that was constantly testing his composure. Zayn’s antics, combined with the deadpan reactions of Solo Sikoa and the jovial nature of Jimmy Uso, made it nearly impossible for Jey to stay in character during those segments.Despite the embarrassment that came with repeatedly breaking character on live television, Jey Uso looks back at the experience fondly. He credits the ""Ucey"" moments and the overall Bloodline storyline with Sami Zayn as some of the most enjoyable times of his career.Despite it being what he considers his most embarrassing career moment, Jey Uso emphasized that it was also one of the best times in his wrestling journey. His chemistry with Zayn, the dynamic within The Bloodline, and the overwhelming fan support turned an initially awkward moment into something iconic.As Jey continues his reign as WWE Intercontinental Champion, the memories of the ""Ucey"" segments serve as a reminder of both the challenges and joys that come with being a top star in WWE. Fans, much like Jey himself, will forever remember these moments as a high point in WWE storytelling, where humor, tension, and emotion collided in perfect harmony.Also read: ""I knew it was the right time to bring him back"": Real-life Bloodline member comments on Jimmy Uso's return at WWE Bad Blood","Jey Uso was asked about his most embarrassing moment in WWE.

Vince Russo Warns Lash Legend Could Upstage Jade Cargill in WWE SmackDown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/vince-russo-warns-lash-legend-could-upstage-jade-cargill-in-wwe-smackdown/articleshow/114376593.cms,"Lash Legend's debuts on SmackDown. Image-WWE.com

Wrestling veteran and former WWE writer Vince Russo has opened up about a unique situation on WWE SmackDown . According to him, the newest member of the SmackDown women’s division, Lash Legend is a lot similar to another heavyweight Jade Cargill and could steal her thunder away. When Legend made her debut against Piper Niven last night, Jade Cargill and her tag team partner Bianca Belair were keeping an eye on the match, indicating a future feud.Lash Legend is a heavyweight just like Cargill, and two physically similar characters could outshine each other, at any moment of time, according to Vince Russo. Lash made her debut and defeated Piper Niven on SmackDown last night, in a dominant display of power, although Chelsea Green was trying her best to prevent her friend Niven from losing. Now seeing the power and promise of Legend, Vince Russo,(on “BroDown”) says that Cargill must be wary of Legend, going forward.""This Lash Legend bro, she's a monster. We got a monster in Jade Cargill. Why are we having two monsters? My perfect analogy is, Was there two Chyna’s bro? Was there or was there one “Ninth Wonder of the World”? Why would you have another monster, when Jade Cargill is a monster? Because now as big and impressive as Lash Legend is, that is going to take away from Jade Cargill."" Side Vince, in the latest episode of bro down. There might be some truth in what Vince says as Lash does come across as a monster, and while the rivalry between her and Cargill might be fun to watch, they both might steal each other’s thunder. If that happens, it might not be the most fruitful thing for the Women’s Division of SmackDown. Do you agree with Vince’s opinion? Drop your comments below.","Vince Russo has opened up about a unique situation on WWE SmackDown.

Six Feet Under,

“It would propel Gunther to even another level to work a program with Brock. The heights that I think Brock could bring him to would make him untouchable.

Because he already has his own style, he has his own pace and everything else. But to work with somebody, a beast like Brock would push him to levels that I’m not sure there’s anybody on the roster right now that does that.” (
