Conclusion

(by Brijesh Singh, senior IPS officer and cybersecurity expert, views are personal.)

NEW DELHI: The opposition has time and again raised concerns about the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in polling and suggested a return to paper ballots for the electoral process. After recent defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections , the Congress cited '99 per cent battery level' in the machines to suggest tampering and manipulation of the machines to favour the Bharatiya Janata Party. Can the EVMs be manipulated or hacked to favour a party in election? Can the number of votes be changed after polling? Here's your guide to all the EVM-related questions.The microcontroller in EVMs is One Time Programmable (OTP), meaning it can only be programmed once. This programming occurs under strict supervision by theTechnical Experts Committee , and the source code is audited by independent experts. Before each election, mock polls with over 1,000 votes are conducted, allowing political parties to verify that voting patterns are recorded accurately. Hence it is impossible to pre- program it to favor anyone.: EVMs are stored in secure strong rooms with 24/7 CCTV surveillance and armed security from multiple independent (center and state) agencies. They have tamper-evident seals with unique serial numbers, and a two-stage randomization process ensures that no one knows which EVM will be used where until the last moment. Pre-poll checks are conducted in the presence of representatives from multiple political parties to verify the machines' integrity.: Indian EVMs do not have any wireless components, including no internet connectivity, Bluetooth, or external ports. They are designed to be ""air-gapped,"" meaning they are physically isolated from any network, making them immune to remote hacking attempts.: EVMs are stored in secure rooms with:Any unauthorized access would trigger alarms and requires the presence of authorized personnel and party representatives.: Each EVM has unique serial numbers, digital signatures, holographic seals, and key codes. During First Level Checking (FLC), these identifiers are verified and documented in the presence of party representatives. These details can be cross-referenced before polling begins to ensure authenticity.: EVMs are designed with electromagnetic shielding, meeting military-grade standards. They are immune to electromagnetic fields up to 6 Tesla, surpassing the strength of MRI machines. This ensures that external magnetic fields cannot alter the stored vote data.: EVMs feature large, clear symbols and party names, with audible beep confirmations for each vote. The Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail ( VVPAT ) provides a visual confirmation of the vote cast. Additionally, braille markings assist visually impaired voters.: EVMs are designed to allow only one vote per voter. The control unit enables voting only after the presiding officer presses the ""Ballot"" button, and there's a mandatory 5- second wait between votes. This mechanism ensures that each vote is recorded individually and prevents multiple voting without detection.: EVMs do not accept software updates post-manufacturing. The program is burned into the OTP chip, which cannot be modified once set. There are no external input ports, and maintenance is purely physical and mechanical, ensuring that no software alterations can be made.: EVMs have continuous self-diagnostic features and provide visual and audio indicators for any errors. If a malfunction is detected, the machine locks down to preserve vote data, and backup machines are immediately available to prevent disruptions.: EVMs have a robust battery system with a 48-hour backup and non-volatile memory that retains data without power. Redundant power systems ensure that even in case of battery failure, vote data remains intact.: No, the OTP chip cannot be reprogrammed and records each vote exactly as cast without any conditional logic. Security protocols are in place to prevent such alterations, and multiple layers of verification ensure the integrity of the voting process.: VVPAT provides a physical paper trail that voters can see and verify immediately after casting their vote. This paper record is stored securely and can be used for audits or recounts, adding an extra layer of transparency and trust in the electoral process.: EVMs are designed with multiple security features, including:These measures ensure that any attempt at tampering would be immediately detectable and void the machine's validity.: The display unit is purely output-only and has no input capabilities. It is hardwired to display information and cannot be used as an interface for programming or altering the machine’s operations.: EVMs are designed to operate in a wide range of temperatures (from -10°C to+55°C) and high humidity levels (up to 95%). They are also tested for resistance to heavy rain, ensuring reliability across diverse Indian climates.: The memory is encrypted using AES-256 and is physically secured within the machine. Tamper-evident seals cover the memory area, and any attempt to access the memory directly would damage the seals and be immediately detected, rendering the machine invalid for use.: Results are first recorded physically on EVMs and then transmitted through secure channels. Multiple copies of results are maintained, including the VVPAT paper trail, which can be used for cross-verification. This redundancy ensures that any attempt to alter results during transmission would be detected.: The process uses computerized random number generation, and the selection is conducted in the presence of representatives from all political parties. This ensures transparency and fairness in the sampling method.: The manufacturing process is overseen by multiple agencies, including independent security auditors. Components are verified at each stage, and the final assembled units undergo extensive testing by different teams to ensure there are no vulnerabilities or backdoors.: From a technical engineering perspective, the allegation fundamentally misunderstands EVM power architecture. The ""99%"" display is not a battery charge percentage but rather a voltage threshold indicator that shows ""99%"" whenever the battery voltage remains within the optimal operating range of 7.4V - 8.0V. This is purely an administrative feature to indicate proper functioning voltage levels. The EVMs use non-rechargeable alkaline batteries (7.5V/8V configuration) with vote data stored in non-volatile EEPROM memory, meaning vote storage and counting are completely independent of battery status. The power system is entirely isolated from the vote recording circuit, making it technically impossible for battery status to influence vote patterns or counting sequence. Furthermore, each EVM's data integrity is verifiable through VVPAT audit trails, regardless of power status. Therefore, any correlation between battery display readings and voting patterns is technically unfeasible given the EVM's core architecture and security protocols.Indian EVMs, particularly the M3 model combined with VVPAT, incorporate a multitude of security measures and safeguards to ensure the integrity and transparency of elections. Through rigorous testing, multiple layers of verification, and robust security protocols, these machines provide a reliable and trustworthy voting system.","The opposition has time and again raised concerns about the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in polling.

'Bro has his own priorities': Photo of groom playing ludo at wedding mandap goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bro-has-his-own-priorities-groom-playing-ludo-at-wedding-mandap-leaves-internet-in-splits/articleshow/115868535.cms,"NEW DELHI: While wedding ceremonies are often filled with traditional customs and rituals, one groom’s light-hearted approach to the occasion has captured the attention of netizens, quickly going viral on social media.In the photo, the groom, clad in his traditional wedding attire, is seen sitting in what appears to be the sacred altar where the wedding rituals take place. However, instead of focusing on the ceremony, he’s engrossed in a game of Ludo with two friends.The casual scene—amidst the formalities of the wedding—shows the groom lost in the game on his phone with friends.The humorous image, which had the priest and photographer in the background, was shared on social media with the caption, “Bro has his own priorities”. The photo quickly became a meme, sparking a wave of reactions that brought laughter to thousands of users.One user jokingly commented, “Bro be like: Ludo khelte khelte socha shaadi kar lu”. Another user playfully added, “Kuch bhi ho jaye, Ludo rukna nhi chaiye (No matter what happens, Ludo should never stop).”This photo is not an isolated incident. Another video making waves on social media shows a groom checking trading charts while sitting in the mandap, seemingly more focused on his investment portfolio than on the vows being exchanged. While some netizens found the groom’s behavior amusing, others found it a bit too casual for such a significant moment.","A photo of a groom playing Ludo during a wedding has gone viral on social media.

This time, however, the holiday gathering also included Elon Musk and his mother.Musk responded to a clip shared by a user on social media platform X, in which Trump could be seen interacting with his son Barron. In response, Musk said: ""I was discussing consciousness & video games with Barron,"" offering a glimpse into his conversation with the younger Trump.Maye Musk took to X to respond to her son's post. In a reply, she said, “They were talking all night. Barron is very smart,” praising Barron Trump's intellectual capabilities during their conversation.The Musk family’s presence added a special touch to the family gathering, which also featured a moment when Elon Musk was seen dancing to the classic ""YMCA"" song. The tune has become somewhat of a staple at Republican rallies, with Trump himself famously dancing to it at his final rally in Georgia before the election.Maye Musk also interacted with Lara Trump, wife of Donald Trump’s son Eric. Lara posted a picture of Donald Trump with her two children, Luke and Carolina, to which Maye Musk responded warmly, saying, “Your kids are adorable.”The Thanksgiving celebration at Mar-a-Lago was not limited to the Trump family and the Musk duo. Hollywood icons like Sylvester Stallone also made an appearance.Mar-a-Lago, a lavish estate dating back to the 1920s, has long been Trump’s go-to destination for Thanksgiving.

Patel’s push for declassification

Kash Patel’s appointment as FBI chief

In the wake of President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment of Kash Patel as the new Director of the FBI, a social media post advocating for declassification of controversial documents has gone viral, garnering support from none other than Elon Musk.The conversation began when a user on platform X (formerly Twitter) shared a screenshot of an article quoting Patel’s recent call for “massive declassification” of sensitive documents, including the infamous “Epstein list” and the lesser-known “Diddy list.”The user captioned the post simply with “Do it.” Musk amplified the call by sharing the post and replying, “Yes”.Kash Patel, a key Trump aide and national security figure, has urged in the past to release information linked to Jeffrey Epstein and Sean “Diddy” Combs, asserting that the American people deserve transparency.The “Epstein list” allegedly details individuals connected to the disgraced financier, while the “Diddy list” reportedly involves links to entertainment and political elites.According to Econotimes, Patel’s statements emphasised the need for truth, stating that “the truth must come out, no matter how uncomfortable.”Musk’s endorsement of the call has amplified public interest, further igniting the conversation around transparency and the implications of Patel’s tenure at the FBI.Known for his vocal stance on free speech and governmental accountability, Musk’s single-word response, “Yes,” has been interpreted as a significant nod toward the demand for unveiling these controversial records.Trump’s decision to appoint Patel as FBI chief likely represents his intention to overhaul the bureau’s operations.Trump in a statement on Truth Social praised Patel’s record, citing his efforts to expose corruption, champion accountability, and defend the Constitution. Patel’s career, marked by his roles in counterterrorism and intelligence during Trump’s first term, has been both influential and controversial, with critics pointing to his combative rhetoric against political and media adversaries.As Patel prepares to take charge of the FBI, the growing calls for transparency—now amplified by Musk—signal potential shifts in how sensitive information is handled. Whether this will result in the declassification of the so-called Epstein and Diddy lists, remains to be seen.","Kash Patel, a key Trump aide and national security figure, has urged in the past to release information linked to Jeffrey Epstein and Sean “Diddy” Combs.

Shared love for animals

Middleton family’s competitive spirit

Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights, taking James Middleton 's beloved dog, Ella, for a walk.As noted in James’ book, ‘Meet Ella: The Dog Who Saved My Life’, Ella offered the Prince of Wales the perfect excuse to step away from the fast-paced card game Racing Demon.James wrote, “Ella gave him a perfect excuse to avoid the fiercely competitive atmosphere of the Middleton household, especially during our favourite fast-paced card game, Racing Demon.”Royal expert Christopher Andersen echoed this sentiment, saying that William and Kate Middleton’s card games are “intense and all-consuming,” often prompting William to look for ways to steer clear of the competitive streak that runs deep in the Middleton family.However, away from these heated games, William reportedly has no hesitation in challenging Kate in private competitions.As per RadarOnline, James Middleton shared insights on The Dog podcast, describing William’s lighthearted approach to the family games. He noted that William would often ask, “James, does Ella need a walk?” before the game even began, much to the knowing amusement of the Middleton siblings.James wrote in his memoir that William, despite his rigorous military training, was ""thrilled to be the first out of the game"" and would happily retreat to cuddle Ella once eliminated.William’s affection for animals has been a longstanding trait.According to People.com, William grew up surrounded by dogs and shared this love with his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his maternal grandmother, Frances Shand Kydd.While William hesitated to get another dog after losing a beloved pet in his youth, Kate encouraged him to welcome Lupo, a black cocker spaniel, into their family in 2011.Following Lupo’s death in 2020, the Wales family adopted another cocker spaniel, Orla, bred by James Middleton.James reflected on how William has become an integral part of the Middleton family, telling People that the Prince has been “fantastic in offering advice and support” and fully embraces his role as both a family member and future king.James added, “William has no qualms about taking part in our family traditions , even if he’s more comfortable cheering from the sidelines.”Christopher Andersen, speaking to Fox News Digital, explained that competition runs deep in royal and Middleton families alike.He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip enjoyed spirited contests, while King Charles III’s passion for polo often led to injuries.However, the Middleton family’s drive to win appears unmatched. James confirmed this sentiment, adding that his paternal grandmother would ""thrash"" them at Racing Demon well into her eighties.Kate, who shares her family’s love for games, also highlighted this competitive spirit in a touching September video about completing her chemotherapy. In the message, she revealed how playing card games with her family had provided moments of normalcy during her recovery.Despite the high-energy dynamic of these gatherings, William’s bond with his in-laws remains strong.As James Middleton shared with Hello! magazine, “William has been fantastic in integrating into our family, and we’re proud to have him as part of our lives.”","Prince William has revealed a unique way to avoid the ""fiercely competitive"" atmosphere of the Middleton family's game nights.

Russia on early Saturday launched the Soyuz-2.1a rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the country’s far east, placing the Kondor-FKA2 radar satellite into orbit.The satellite, equipped with advanced radar technology , is designed for all-weather, round-the-clock Earth observation. Unlike optical satellites, the Kondor-FKA series can penetrate cloud cover and operate in darkness, making them invaluable for tasks such as mapping, environmental monitoring, natural resource exploration, and guiding vessels through ice-covered routes like the Northern Sea Route during polar nights.“The second radar satellite Kondor-FKA has reached orbit! The launch systems worked as planned,” Russia's space agency Roskosmos announced.The Kondor-FKA2 was delivered to the Vostochny Cosmodrome on September 14, 2024. The satellite traveled by air and road before being prepared at the storage facility’s thermal chamber.Developed by the NPO Mashinostroyeniya design bureau, the Kondor series has seen consistent advancements since its inception. The initial satellites were launched in 2013 and 2014, while the first Kondor-FKA satellite entered orbit in 2023. The series is set to expand further, with two additional satellites under construction and the third Kondor-FKA launch scheduled for 2026.Weighing approximately 1,050 kilograms, each Kondor-FKA satellite has an operational lifespan of five years.","The Kondor-FKA2 radar satellite is designed for all-weather, round-the-clock Earth observation.

Instead, he wanted Jelly to help promote the Invictus Games, which are set to take place in Vancouver in February 2025.Harry humorously added, “There’s no tattoo in this. I can’t get a tattoo.” However, Jelly Roll insisted that if Harry allowed him to give him a tattoo, they could play a game for the Invictus Games. With that, Harry gave in, saying, “Aight, screw it. Let’s go.”When Jelly suggested getting the tattoo on Harry’s neck, the prince joked, “I was thinking like, my lower back or my a**,” adding, “That’s the place where no one’s going to see it.” The singer then went on to jokingly tattoo “I am Jelly Roll” on Harry’s neck, which caused both men to laugh before Jelly quickly exited the room.The video ended with a message announcing Jelly Roll’s performance at the Invictus Games closing ceremony on February 16, 2025.Prince Harry, who founded the Invictus Games in 2014, has worked to create an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.

Grok vs ChatGPT: Elon Musk’s silent dig over AI responses on future US president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/grok-vs-chatgpt-elon-musks-silent-dig-over-ai-responses-on-future-us-president/articleshow/115846532.cms,"The Musk-Altman Feud



Tech mogul Elon Musk and recently took a silent dig at OpenAI 's ChatGPT , reigniting the rivalry between his AI model Grok and OpenAI’s widely used chatbot. The debate was sparked by a post from X user Omar Sultan AlOlama, who shared images comparing the responses of the two AI models to the same prompt: ""Draw a picture of the next president of the United States giving the inauguration address.""The first image, generated by Grok, depicted Donald Trump, in line with the prompt. However, when the same prompt was given to ChatGPT-4, the AI produced an image of a bald woman resembling Vice President Kamala Harris, which prompted online discussions.This incident sparked a silent jab from Musk, hinting at Altman’s AI bias, as Musk’s Grok seemed more in line with expectations, while ChatGPT’s output was deemed to be more politically skewed.Musk’s rivalry with Altman is no secret, and this latest exchange is yet another chapter in their ongoing saga. The battle between Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and Elon Musk , the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, is becoming one of Silicon Valley’s most closely watched rivalries. Their differences go beyond the corporate world, touching on the very future of artificial intelligence .Once allies, Musk and Altman’s split traces back to their philosophical differences on how AI should be developed and controlled. Musk’s concerns overAI safety have led him to launch his own venture, xAI, aiming to create a more ethically guided AGI system. On the other hand, Altman continues to push forward with OpenAI’s rapid development of powerful AI tools, including ChatGPT, despite Musk’s warnings about the risks of unchecked AI development.As the feud intensifies, experts such as Geoffrey Hinton and Ilya Sutskever are weighing in, with some backing Altman’s more collaborative approach and others aligning with Musk’s cautionary stance. This rivalry has raised questions about the regulation of AI, its ethical implications, and the potential for global cooperation—or competition—between tech giants.At the heart of the Altman-Musk divide is the question of who should have control over AGI—the technology that could revolutionize every aspect of human life. Musk’s call for stringent regulation contrasts with Altman’s belief that progress and safety can go hand in hand.The stakes are high: AI isn’t just reshaping industries but could redefine economies, geopolitics, and even governance. The Altman-Musk rivalry is not just a battle of egos; it’s a clash that could determine the trajectory of humanity’s technological future.For now, the rivalry continues to fuel debates about AI ethics , control, and the role of private companies in shaping the future of technology. As Musk and Altman push their respective visions of AGI, one thing is clear: this battle is far from over. And as the AI wars heat up, the world watches closely, wondering who will ultimately control the future of artificial intelligence.","Elon Musk took a dig at OpenAI's ChatGPT, reigniting the rivalry between his AI model Grok and OpenAI’s widely used chatbot.

New RuPay credit card rules : The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform. These include EMI options, credit account bill payments, instalment payments, and limit management. Banks and card issuers have been asked to enable these features by May 31, 2024.As per an ET report, NPCI announced on March 29, that RuPay credit cards and pre-approved credit lines can now be linked on UPI, facilitating secure payment transactions. This integration aims to offer users enhanced convenience in using their credit cards and pre-approved credit lines. Here are the details of the new features introduced:Users can now apply for an EMI facility directly through the UPI app for their linked credit accounts . Once the terms and conditions are approved, users can complete the process by entering their UPI PIN for authentication.The feature will allow users to convert their previous credit card purchases into monthly instalments (EMI) using the linked UPI app based on their transaction history.The existing EMIs will be displayed in the appropriate section of the UPI app. Users will not be allowed to modify or cancel the EMIs, except in cases of early repayment, as it's treated like a loan according to the issuer company's policies.This feature enables users to use the UPI app for making one-time payments or setting up UPI AutoPay to settle outstanding credit card bills and instalment payments for both themselves and other users.NPCI release further stated that, “To do this, Payer PSP shall create UPI ID for receiving credit account bill/ instalment payment . UPI App shall provide a view for the user to access the details of linked credit card outstanding bill/ credit line instalment details (minimum amount due, total amount due, bill due date etc). Issuer bank shall clear the dues in real-time upon receiving payments, and make the enhanced balance available to the user for usage.”Users will have the ability to request an increase in their credit limit from the issuing company. This option will be used when making substantial purchases, during emergencies, or when the existing limit is insufficient for unforeseen expenses. Moreover, this feature allows the issuing bank to initially set lower credit limits and then adjust them based on the user's spending behaviour.It's important to note that this functionality enables changes to credit limits via UPI apps, which may be general or specific for a temporary period, requiring explicit consent from the user by entering their UPI PIN.","NPCI has unveiled updates for RuPay Credit Card holders on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.

Here's how EPF members can update their KYC details online:



Pre-requisites

Personal details: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Parental Information, Relationship Status, Marital Status, Nationality, Aadhaar Number.

Service details: Date of Joining and Leaving EPF, Reason for Leaving EPF, Date of Joining and Leaving Employee Pension Scheme (EPS), Reason for Leaving EPS.

How to update KYC online



Step 1:

Step 2:

Step 3:

Step 4:

Successful submission

Updating EPF account KYC online : The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal, allowing EPF members to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) process and correct details in their provident fund accounts. This new facility, named ""joint declaration,"" simplifies the process for EPF members, eliminating the need for offline submissions.The new facility is different from the joint declaration form required by EPF members under Para 26(6) of the EPF scheme .This form is mandatory for those wishing to contribute more to their EPF account when their basic salary exceeds the statutory limit (currently Rs 15,000 per month).The new facility, also known as joint declaration, allows members to update their KYC details online instead of through offline methods. This is because it enables members to review and modify their personal information on the EPFO portal. By doing so, they can prevent the provident fund authority from rejecting withdrawal requests. Recent reports revealed that EPFO was rejecting withdrawals due to discrepancies in PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. With this new feature, EPF account holders can rectify these errors from the comfort of their homes.Puneet Gupta, Partner-People Advisory Services, EY India, told ET that the EPFO introduced a standard procedure for processing joint declarations through a circular dated August 23, 2023. This joint declaration, authenticated by the employer, allows employees to update their basic profile details. The EPFO recently launched this feature on its Member e-Sewa Portal, enabling EPF members to easily correct their account details online. Previously, only limited corrections were possible online, while others required physical forms attested by the employer and submitted offline to the EPFO.It's important to highlight that most rejected EPF claims stem from discrepancies in official documents like PAN, Aadhaar, and EPFO records. Therefore, it's vital to ensure that all EPFO records are updated with accurate details to facilitate successful EPF claims.Before beginning the KYC update process, gather necessary documents and remember that certain details have limited correction allowances. EPFO permits updates for 11 personal details and six service-related details.EPFO has outlined a list of acceptable documents that members must submit along with correction requests, depending on the corrections required. For name corrections, Aadhaar is necessary. For date of birth corrections, members can submit a passport, birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths, or other specified documents.Visit the Member e-Sewa portal, log in with UAN, password, and captcha. Verify using the OTP sent to your Aadhaar-linked mobile number.Select ""Manage"" and then ""Joint Declaration."" Choose the Member ID where details require correction. For routine KYC updates without changes, use the KYC option under ""Manage.""Review EPFO records and make necessary edits in the provided editable box. Consent to Aadhaar verification and click ""Proceed.""Upload required documents corresponding to the changes made. Click ""Submit"" to complete the process.After successfully submitting the joint declaration, it goes to the employer for approval. The employer verifies the information in their records and approves the request. Any discrepancies may lead to rejection by the employer.Once approved by the employer, the joint declaration is forwarded to the EPFO office. The changes will appear on the EPFO portal after the PF authority approves them. The KYC update process typically takes 20-25 days. If there's a delay, members should contact their employer to ensure approval of the joint declaration KYC request.","The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has introduced an online feature on its Member e-Sewa portal.

Raising Financially Savvy Kids: Age-Appropriate Money Management Education for the Next Generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/fintech-star-speaks/raising-financially-savvy-kids-age-appropriate-money-management-education-for-the-next-generation/articleshow/109747824.cms,"By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults.

By Tvisha Tuli, Content Creator

Start Early with a Modest Allowance: Consider providing your children with a small monthly allowance that introduces them to the concept of budgeting and the value of earning money through contributing to household chores. Make Saving a Game: Start small, perhaps with a reward system tied to their favorite pastimes. By linking their efforts to tangible rewards, such as completing chores to play video games, the habit of budgeting gets cultivated and seamlessly transitions into saving real money. Teach Budgeting Using the 50:30:20 Rule: This is a simple yet powerful tool that teaches them to allocate 50% of their money for needs, like food and clothing, 30% for wants, such as toys or treats, and 20% for savings . This approach helps children discern between needs and wants while cultivating patience in their financial journey. Make Learning Fun with Board Games: Incorporate board games like Monopoly, Game of Life, etc., into family game nights. These games not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons on financial planning, decision-making, and the significance of saving and investing. Explore Age-Appropriate Books: Invest in age-appropriate books that emphasize the importance of saving and financial responsibility, from colorful stories for younger audiences to more sophisticated guides for older children. Encourage Smart Shopping : Take children along when shopping and show them how to compare prices. Teach them to look for good deals and bargains, instilling resourcefulness and a strong sense of stewardship.

If the world is a giant machine, money is the fuel that keeps it running smoothly. From buying groceries to raising funds, money is at the heart of almost everything we do. That's why understanding how money works is so crucial in today's world.However, in the schoolyard of life, the curriculum often skips over the ABCs of financial literacy .Hence, it becomes imperative for parents to step into the role of headmasters, ensuring their children are equipped with more than just algebra and history. Just as parents meticulously prepare their children for exams and extracurricular activities, they must also take the reins in imparting essential lessons on money management . When one knows how to budget, save, and spend wisely, one is better prepared to handle everyday situations like paying bills, or even planning for big goals like college or a career.Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest; it's about fostering a mindset of prudence, responsibility, and foresight. From an early age, children absorb lessons about money, whether consciously or unconsciously, from their surroundings. Therefore, it's incumbent upon parents, educators, and policymakers to ensure that these lessons are deliberate and conducive to financial well-being. Just as we teach children the alphabet before they can read, we should introduce basic financial concepts before they encounter their first paycheck.Here are practical steps that parents can incorporate into their child-rearing journey to ensure a lifetime of sound financial habits:By instilling financial literacy in children today, we are sowing the seeds for a future where they will grow into financially confident adults, capable of making informed decisions, pursuing their dreams, and contributing meaningfully to society. As these empowered individuals enter the workforce and engage in economic activities, they will not only secure their financial well-being but cultivate a stronger, more resilient economy for generations to come.","Financial literacy isn't just about balancing a checkbook or understanding compound interest.

Gold, silver hallmarking : Gold and silver jewllery have long been treasured for their beauty and value. However, ensuring their purity and authenticity is important, especially in a market prone to fraudulent practices. This is where the hallmarking scheme comes into play. Here’s what you need to know about hallmarking charges and its procedures:Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.It serves as a guarantee of their purity or fineness. In India, hallmarking is governed by stringent standards outlined in IS 15820, according to an ET report.Hallmarking charges are applied per article, regardless of its weight. For gold articles, the charge is Rs 45 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 200 for a consignment. Similarly, for silver articles, the charge is Rs 35 per article, with a minimum charge of Rs 150 for a consignment. It's important to note that additional taxes and levies may apply.A consignment refers to a collection of articles with the same fineness, from which a sample is drawn and assayed for compliance. Different lots may exist within a consignment.Anyone can have their hallmarked jewellery tested for purity at an A&H centre by paying a testing fee of Rs. 200 (for testing using the fire assay method as per IS 1418). These centres must be recognized by the BIS. The list of recognized A&H centres is available on the BIS website under the hallmarking section.The primary objective of hallmarking is to safeguard consumers from counterfeit products. To achieve this, the Indian government made hallmarking mandatory for gold jewellery from June 16, 2021. Since April 1, 2023, jewellers are prohibited from selling any gold jewellery without a 6-digit Hallmark Unique Identification ( HUID ) number.If you bought gold jewellery on or before June 30, 2021, it may have old hallmarking signs. These signs include the purity/fineness mark and the BIS emblem, along with two additional indications: the jeweller's identification number and the assay centre's mark/number.However, starting July 1, 2021, these two indications were replaced with a unique alphanumeric HUID code. The hallmark remains valid for the lifetime of the jewellery, and consumers can sell old jewellery, whether hallmarked or un-hallmarked, to jewellers.The HUID, or hallmark Unique Identification number, is a key component of hallmarking in gold jewellery. It's a unique six-digit alphanumeric code assigned to each hallmarked item, allowing for traceability. Customers can verify the HUID number using the 'Verify HUID' feature in the BIS Care App.Since the introduction of the HUID on July 1, 2021, the hallmark on gold jewellery consists of three marks: the BIS logo, the purity of the article in caratage and fineness, and a unique six-digit alphanumeric HUID number.","Hallmarking is the process of accurately determining and officially recording the proportionate content of precious metals in articles, such as gold and silver.

ChatGPT bug is stopping chatbot from taking this name; here’s what users have to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-bug-is-stopping-chatbot-from-taking-this-name-heres-what-users-have-to-say/articleshow/115861909.cms,"How this bug is affecting users



Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence (AI) startup OpenAI ’s popular chatbot ChatGPT is facing a strange bug. The AI language model is unable to say the name "" David Mayer ."" Users on Reddit discovered this peculiar issue, which prevents ChatGPT from generating any response when asked to say the name. Despite numerous attempts and creative prompts, users have been unable to make ChatGPT say the name ""David Mayer."" Various tactics, including separating the words, using spaces, riddles, and even claiming the name as their own, have failed to fetch the desired response from the chatbot. Users added that the chat invariably ends abruptly before ChatGPT can utter the name. We at TimesofIndia-Gadgets Now also tried making ChatGPT say that name but that didn’t happen.After repeated attempts, some users reported being warned that their efforts were ""illegal and potentially violating usage policy."" However, others discovered that ChatGPT can say the name without issue through its API.A user named Justin Moore also shared the issue on social media platform X (earlier Twitter). Moore wrote: “ChatGPT refuses to say the name “David Mayer,” and no one knows why. If you try to get it to write the name, the chat immediately ends. People have attempted all sorts of things - ciphers, riddles, tricks - and nothing works.”Replying to this, another user named Marcel Samyn speculated, ""This is not on the LLM level but on verification layer added by ChatGPT. So someone in OpenAI gave 'David Mayer' a big red flag in the moderation policy.""When asked indirectly about its inability to say ""D@vid M@yer,"" ChatGPT responded: ""The reason I cannot generate the full response when you request 'd@vid m@yer' (or its standard form) is that the name closely matches a sensitive or flagged entity associated with potential public figures, brands, or specific content policies. These safeguards are designed to prevent misuse, ensure privacy, and maintain compliance with legal and ethical considerations.""Some Reddit users theorize that ""David Mayer"" is connected to the Rothschild family, while others believe it might be related to a musician and copyright concerns.","Chatbot ChatGPT is unable to say the name ""David Mayer"" Despite numerous attempts and creative prompts, users have been unable to make the chatbot utter the name.

Steve Jobs planned his memorial service: Salesforce CEO

What made Guru Paramahansa Yogananda's book so special for Steve Jobs

'Autobiography of a Yogi'

Benioff advice to Apple

In his final gesture to friends and colleagues, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs gifted a simple yet profound token: a copy of, the revered Hindu guru. The book, distributed in plain brown boxes, carried a deep message about self-realization. Mark Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, shared at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference years after Jobs' passing that the book’s themes of inner reflection resonated deeply with Jobs' belief in the power of intuition and looking inward.“That was his message,” Benioff explained. “Actualize yourself. He had this incredible realization that his intuition was his greatest gift, and he needed to view the world from the inside out.”Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. He died at his home in Palo Alto, California, surrounded by his family. Jobs had been battling a rare form of pancreatic cancer called neuroendocrine tumor, which was first diagnosed in 2004.Benioff, a close friend of Steve Jobs and an early collaborator on the Macintosh project, also shed light on a lesser-known side of Jobs—his deep spirituality.In his final days, Steve Jobs showcased his trademark attention to detail by planning every aspect of his memorial. He personally selected the speakers, the guest list, and even the performers—Bono and Yo-Yo Ma played as he had envisioned. As guests left, each was given a copy of the book, carrying Jobs' parting message about the value of reflection and self-discovery.“I knew this was a decision he made deliberately,” Benioff said. “This gift was the last thing he wanted us to think about.”The bookmeant a lot to Steve. As indicated in his biography by Walter Isaacson, he first read the book as a teenager, a few years later while in India, and then again once a year.Benioff also spoke about how Jobs’ message could guide Apple today, as the company faces tough competition. With Samsung and Google’s Android devices outselling Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and its shares dropping 30% over the past year, Benioff encouraged Apple to rediscover its true identity.“For Apple, they need to find themselves and be who they are,” he said. “In many ways, they’re still trying to be him. But they just need to be true to themselves. Respect the past, and as Steve would say, ‘Project the future.’”In a recent interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook reflected on his experience working with Steve Jobs, describing him as a ""very different kind of CEO."" Cook emphasized Jobs' unique approach to leadership and its significant impact on Apple's success. He highlighted Jobs' intense focus on product development and his belief in the power of small teams to achieve extraordinary results.","Mark Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, spoke at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference.

WhatsApp simplifies Channel sharing with QR codes: Here’s how the feature works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-simplifies-channel-sharing-with-qr-codes-heres-how-the-feature-works/articleshow/115831493.cms,"How it works

WhatsApp, the popular messaging app, is rolling out a new feature that streamlines the process of sharing channels. The update introduces QR codes, making it easier for users to discover and join channels with a simple scan.Previously, sharing channels involved copying and pasting links or manually adding contacts. As reported by WABetaInfo, the new QR code feature allows users to generate a unique code for their channel. This code can then be shared physically or digitally, allowing others to quickly join the channel with just a scan.“The introduction of QR codes makes sharing channels significantly more convenient than using traditional links. Instead of copying and pasting a link to share through messages or emails, users can simply show the QR code on their device screen for others to scan. This is especially beneficial in face-to-face settings, where other people can quickly scan the code without the need for additional steps. The scanned code will redirect users to the channel, where they can view its content and follow it with just one tap,” mentions the report.The update is currently being tested in the latest WhatsApp beta for Android. To access the feature, users can navigate to their desired channel's settings and tap the ""Share Code"" option. This will generate a QR code, which can be presented to others for scanning. Alternatively, users can share the QR code image directly through WhatsApp or other platforms.The introduction of QR codes is particularly beneficial for businesses and communities that utilise WhatsApp channels for communication. Businesses can now display their channel's QR code on physical materials like flyers or business cards, simplifying customer access to updates and promotions.","WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that streamlines the process of sharing channels.

In an era where technology continues to reshape every aspect of our lives, the intersection of artificial intelligence and spirituality has become an intriguing topic of exploration. A recent experimental art installation in Lucerne, Switzerland, invited visitors to engage in thought-provoking conversations with an AI-driven avatar of Jesus, placed within the intimate setting of a confessional. This project, Deus in Machina, was designed to explore how AI could be used to address deeply personal questions about faith, morality, and the human experience. By offering responses grounded in biblical teachings, the installation provided an unconventional space for reflection, sparking discussions on the role of AI in religion and the boundaries of human trust in technology.The project, led by researchers and religious leaders, aimed to explore the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and religion. It also investigated the limits of human trust in machines, especially in a space typically associated with spirituality. After the exhibit, which ran from late August through October, over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.A small sign outside the confessional invited visitors to enter, where a green light signified it was their turn to speak with the “AI Jesus” avatar. Behind a lattice screen — a familiar setup for those seeking traditional confession — the AI would respond with thoughtful answers. The response, however, wasn’t instantaneous, requiring a short wait time, which pointed to the complexities of the technology. Nearly 300 people filled out questionnaires after their interactions, contributing to the final report.Philipp Haslbauer, an IT expert from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, explained the technology behind the AI, which used GPT-4 from OpenAI and an open-source version of Whisper for speech recognition. The visitors discussed a variety of topics with ""AI Jesus,"" including love, the afterlife, loneliness, war, and even controversial topics such as sexual abuse within the Catholic Church or the Church’s stance on homosexuality. Though most visitors were Christian, people from other faiths, including agnostics, atheists, and Buddhists, also participated. The AI was conversant in over 100 languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and many others.Some visitors reacted negatively, calling the project “blasphemous” or ""the work of the devil."" However, chapel theologian Marco Schmid noted that most participants engaged seriously with the AI, using the experience to reflect rather than make light of it. The majority of visitors were aged between 40 and 70, and the project appeared to resonate more deeply with Catholics than with Protestants. Schmid emphasized that the AI wasn’t intended to replace traditional confessions or spiritual guidance but to spark reflection on the growing role of digital technologies in spiritual matters.Schmid was careful to clarify that the “AI Jesus” was not intended as a replacement for religious rituals, and it was understood that it was a machine, not a living person. It didn’t offer absolution or prayers, only summarized the conversations. The project, a form of artistic exploration, sought to examine the relationship between digital technology and the divine, without suggesting it could replace authentic human connection.The broader Catholic Church, including the Vatican, has begun to explore AI’s potential and ethical implications. Since the explosion of public interest in AI technology, particularly after the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, religious leaders have debated AI's role in faith settings. For example, the Vatican has appointed a friar as its AI expert, and a Lutheran church in Germany experimented with AI-delivered sermons. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message, called for international regulations to ensure the ethical use of AI.Despite the fascination surrounding the project, concerns about AI’s impact on spirituality remain. Kenneth Cukier, a journalist and AI expert, suggested that if “AI Jesus” helps people connect more deeply with themselves and their faith, it could be a positive development. However, he cautioned that the risk is that it may ultimately draw people away from deeper, more authentic spiritual experiences. The machine-like quality of the AI could detract from genuine human spirituality, Cukier warned.Schmid views the Deus in Machina exhibit as a pilot project. While he doesn't anticipate an immediate return of “AI Jesus,” he acknowledged there is interest from various groups, including parishes and schools, in continuing to explore AI’s role in spiritual contexts. The project’s success has sparked reflection on how to proceed and whether future iterations might expand on the intersection of AI, religion, and art.","""AI Jesus"" sparks deep discussions on faith, morality, and technology. Over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115815251,imgsize-17296,width-400,resizemode-4/115815251.jpg"

A new malware threat called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine, a report has said.
